'It will do well, if it ever comes to that,' said Frodo. \
\uc0\u8232 \
'Ah!' said Sam. 'And where will they live? That's what I often wonder.' \
\uc0\u8232 \
For a while the hobbits continued to talk and think of the past journey \
and of the perils that lay ahead; but such was the virtue of the land of \
Rivendell that soon all fear and anxiety was lifted from their minds. The \
future, good or ill, was not forgotten, but ceased to have any power over \
the present. Health and hope grew strong in them, and they were content with \
each good day as it came, taking pleasure in every meal, and in every word \
and song. \
\uc0\u8232 \
So the days slipped away, as each morning dawned bright and fair, and \
each evening followed cool and clear. But autumn was waning fast; slowly the \
golden light faded to pale silver, and the lingering leaves fell from the \
naked trees. A wind began to blow chill from the Misty Mountains to the \
east. The Hunter's Moon waxed round in the night sky, and put to flight all \
the lesser stars. But low in the South one star shone red. Every night, as \
the Moon waned again, it shone brighter and brighter. Frodo could see it \
from his window, deep in the heavens burning like a watchful eye that glared \
above the trees on the brink of the valley. \

The hobbits had been nearly two months in the House of Elrond, and \
November had gone by with the last shreds of autumn, and December was \
passing, when the scouts began to return. Some had gone north beyond the \
springs of the Hoarwell into the Ettenmoors; and others had gone west, and \
with the help of Aragorn and the Rangers had searched the lands far down the \
Greyflood, as far as Tharbad, where the old North Road crossed the river by \
a ruined town. Many had gone east and south; and some of these had crossed \
the Mountains and entered Mirkwood, while others had climbed the pass at the \
source of the Gladden River, and had come down into Wilderland and over the \
Gladden Fields and so at length had reached the old home of Radagast at \
Rhosgobel. Radagast was not there; and they had returned over the high pass \
that was called the Dimrill Stair. The sons of Elrond, Elladan and Elrohir, \
were the last to return; they had made a great journey, passing down the \
\uc0\u8232 \
\uc0\u8232 \
\uc0\u8232 \
\uc0\u8232 \
Silverlode into a strange country, but of their errand they would not speak \
to any save to Elrond. \
\uc0\u8232 \
In no region had the messengers discovered any signs or tidings of the \
Riders or other servants of the Enemy. Even from the Eagles of the Misty \
Mountains they had learned no fresh news. Nothing had been seen or heard of \
Gollum; but the wild wolves were still gathering, and were hunting again far \
up the Great River. Three of the black horses had been found at once drowned \
in the flooded Ford. On the rocks of the rapids below it searchers \
discovered the bodies of five more, and also a long black cloak, slashed and \
tattered. Of the Black Riders no other trace was to be seen, and nowhere was \
their presence to be felt. It seemed that they had vanished from the North. \
\uc0\u8232 \
\'e2\'80\'99Eight out of the Nine are accounted for at least,' said Gandalf. 'It \
is rash to be too sure, yet I think that we may hope now that the \
Ringwraiths were scattered, and have been obliged to return as best they \
could to their Master in Mordor, empty and shapeless. \
\uc0\u8232 \
Tf that is so, it will be some time before they can begin the hunt \
again. Of course the Enemy has other servants, but they will have to journey \
all the way to the borders of Rivendell before they can pick up our trail. \
\uc0\u8232 \
And if we are careful that will be hard to find. But we must delay no \
longer.' \
\uc0\u8232 \
Elrond summoned the hobbits to him. He looked gravely at Frodo. 'The \
time has come,' he said. 'If the Ring is to set out, it must go soon. But \
those who go with it must not count on their errand being aided by war or \
force. They must pass into the domain of the Enemy far from aid. Do you \
still hold to your word, Frodo, that you will be the Ring-bearer?' \
\uc0\u8232 \
'I do,' said Frodo. 'I will go with Sam.' \
\uc0\u8232 \
'Then I cannot help you much, not even with counsel,' said Elrond. 'I \
can foresee very little of your road; and how your task is to be achieved I \
do not know. The Shadow has crept now to the feet of the Mountains, and \
draws nigh even to the borders of Greyflood; and under the Shadow all is \
dark to me. You will meet many foes, some open, and some disguised; and \
you \
\uc0\u8232 \
may find friends upon your way when you least look for it. I will send out \
messages, such as I can contrive, to those whom I know in the wide world; \
but so perilous are the lands now become that some may well miscarry, or \
come no quicker than you yourself. \
\uc0\u8232 \
'And I will choose you companions to go with you, as far as they will \
