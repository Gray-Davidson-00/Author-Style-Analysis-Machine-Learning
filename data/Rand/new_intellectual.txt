Who are to be the New Intellectuals? 


“Any man or woman who is willing to think. All those who know that man s life must be guided by 
reason, those who value their own life and are not willing to surrender it to the cult of despair in 
the modern jungle of cynical impotence, just as they are not willing to surrender the world to the 
Dark Ages and the rule of the brutes. ” 

This book presents the essentials of Ayn Rand’s philosophy “for those who wish to acquire an 
integrated view of existence.” In the title essay, she offers an analysis of Western culture, discusses 
the causes of its progress, its decline, its present bankruptcy, and points the road to an intellectual 
renaissance. 

Ayn Rand raises the standard of “ reason , individualism, and capitalism ” against today’s prevalent 
doctrines of mysticism, altruism, and collectivism. The novels that present her unconventional views 
have become modern classics. 



THE GENIUS OF AYN RAND 


ATLAS SHRUGGED 

Introduction by Leonard Peikoff. First published in 1957, this epochal novel has been a bestseller for 
more than four decades as well as an intellectual landmark. Peopled with larger-than-life heroes and 
villains, and charged with towering questions of good and evil, it is a philosophical revolution told in 
the form of an action thriller. 0-451-19114-5 

THE FOUNTAINHEAD 

Afterword by Leonard Peikoff. Vividly written and boldly original, The Fountainhead has been a 
phenomenal bestseller since it was first published in 1943. As explosive and dazzling today as it was 
when it was written, this novel reinvents man the hero — and exposes the evil of those who try to 
destroy him. 0-451-19115-3 


THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS: 

A New Concept of Egoism 

Ayn Rand explains what “selfishness” is, and why the pursuit of his own rational self-interest is every 
individual’s highest moral obligation. 0-451-16393-1 


RETURN OF THE PRIMITIVE: 

The Anti-Industrial Revolution 

Edited with an introduction and additional essays by Peter Schwartz. Ayn Rand identifies the 
intellectual roots of “political correctness,” urging people to repudiate its mindless nihilism and to 
uphold a philosophy of reason, individualism, capitalism, and technological progress. 0-452-01184-1

PREFACE 


This book is intended for those who wish to assume the responsibility of becoming the new 
intellectuals. It contains the main philosophical passages from my novels and presents the outline of a 
new philosophical system. 

The full system is implicit in these excerpts (particularly in Galt’s speech), but its fundamentals are 
indicated only in the widest terms and require a detailed, systematic presentation in a philosophical 
treatise. I am working on such a treatise at present; it will deal predominantly with the issue which is 
barely touched upon in Galt’s speech: epistemology, and will present a new theory of the nature, 
source and validation of concepts. This work will require several years; until then, I offer the present 
book as a lead or a summary for those who wish to acquire an integrated view of existence. They may 
regard it as a basic outline; it will give them the guidance they need, but only if they think through and 
understand the exact meaning and the full implications of these excerpts. 

I am often asked whether I am primarily a novelist or a philosopher. The answer is: both. In a 
certain sense, every novelist is a philosopher, because one cannot present a picture of human 
existence without a philosophical framework; the novelist’s only choice is whether that framework is 
present in his story explicitly or implicitly, whether he is aware of it or not, whether he holds his 
philosophical convictions consciously or subconsciously. This involves another choice: whether his 
work is his individual projection of existing philosophical ideas or whether he originates a 
philosophical framework of his own. I did the second. That is not the specific task of a novelist; I had 
to do it, because my basic view of man and of existence was in co nfl ict with most of the existing 
philosophical theories. In order to define, explain and present my concept of man, I had to become a 
philosopher in the specific meaning of the term. 

For those who may be interested in the chronological development of my thinking, I have included 
excerpts from all four of my novels. They may observe the progression from a political theme in We 
the Living to a metaphysical theme in Atlas Shrugged. 

These excerpts are necessarily condensed summaries, because the full statement of the subjects 
involved is presented, in each novel, by means of the events of the story. The events are the concretes 
and the particulars, of which the speeches are the abstract summations. 

When I say that these excerpts are merely an outline, I do not mean to imply that my full system is 
still to be defined or discovered; I had to define it before I could start writing Atlas Shrugged. Galt’s 
speech is its briefest summary. 

Until I complete the presentation of my philosophy in a fully detailed form, this present book may 
serve as an outline or a program or a manifesto. 

For reasons which are made clear in the following pages, the name I have chosen for my 
philosophy is Objectivism. 

— AYN RAND 


October, 1960 



For the New Intellectual 


&lt; 3 &gt;= 


When a man, a business corporation or an entire society is approaching bankruptcy, there are two 
courses that those involved can follow: they can evade the reality of their situation and act on a 
frantic, blind, range-of-the-moment expediency — not daring to look ahead, wishing no one would 
name the truth, yet desperately hoping that something will save them somehow — or they can identify 
the situation, check their premises, discover their hidden assets and start rebuilding. 

America, at present, is following the first course. The grayness, the stale cynicism, the 
noncommittal cautiousness, the guilty evasiveness of our public voices suggest the attitude of the 
courtiers in the story “The Emperor’s New Clothes” who professed admiration for the Emperor’s 
non-existent garments, having accepted the assertion that anyone who failed to perceive them was 
morally depraved at heart. 

Let me be the child in the story and declare that the Emperor is naked — or that America is 
culturally bankrupt. 

In any given period of history, a culture is to be judged by its dominant philosophy, by the prevalent 
trend of its intellectual life as expressed in morality, in politics, in economics, in art. Professional 
intellectuals are the voice of a culture and are, therefore, its leaders, its integrators and its 
bodyguards. America’s intellectual leadership has collapsed. Her virtues, her values, her enormous 
power are scattered in a silent underground and will remain private, subjective, historically impotent 
if left without intellectual expression. America is a country without voice or defense — a country sold 
out and abandoned by her intellectual bodyguards. 

Bankruptcy is defined as the state of being at the end of one’s resources. What are the intellectual 
values or resources offered to us by the present guardians of our culture? In philosophy, we are taught 
that man’s mind is impotent, that reality is unknowable, that knowledge is an illusion, and reason a 
superstition. In psychology, we are told that man is a helpless automaton, determined by forces 
beyond his control, motivated by innate depravity. In literature, we are shown a line-up of murderers, 
dipsomaniacs, drug addicts, neurotics and psychotics as representatives of man’s soul — and are 
invited to identify our own among them — with the belligerent assertions that life is a sewer, a foxhole 
or a rat race, with the whining injunctions that we must love everything, except virtue, and forgive 
everything, except greatness. In politics, we are told that America, the greatest, noblest, freest country 
on earth, is politically and morally inferior to Soviet Russia, the bloodiest dictatorship in history — 
and that our wealth should be given away to the savages of Asia and Africa, with apologies for the 
fact that we have produced it while they haven’t. If we look at modern intellectuals, we are 
confronted with the grotesque spectacle of such characteristics as militant uncertainty, crusading 
cynicism, dogmatic agnosticism, boastful self-abasement and self-righteous depravity — in an 
atmosphere of guilt, of panic, of despair, of boredom and of all-pervasive evasion. If this is not the 
state of being at the end of one’s resources, there is no further place to go. 

Everybody seems to agree that civilization is facing a crisis, but nobody cares to define its nature, 



to discover its cause and to assume the responsibility of formulating a solution. In times of danger, a 
morally healthy culture rallies its values, its self-esteem and its crusading spirit to fight for its moral 
ideals with full, righteous confidence. But this is not what we see today. If we ask our intellectual 
leaders what are the ideals we should fight for, their answer is such a sticky puddle of stale syrup — 
of benevolent bromides and apologetic generalities about brother love, global progress and universal 
prosperity at America’s expense — that a fly would not die for it or in it. 

One of America’s tragic errors is that too many of her best minds believe — as they did in the past 
— that the solution is to turn anti-intellectual and rely on some cracker-barrel sort of folksy wisdom. 
The exact opposite is true. What we need most urgently is to recognize the enormous power and the 
crucial importance of the intellectual professions. A culture cannot exist without a constant stream of 
ideas and the alert, independent minds who originate them; it cannot exist without a philosophy of 
life, without those who formulate it and express it. A country without intellectuals is like a body 
without a head. And that is precisely the position of America today. Our present state of cultural 
disintegration is not maintained and prolonged by intellectuals as such, but by the fact that we haven’t 
any. The majority of those who posture as intellectuals today are frightened zombies, posturing in a 
vacuum of their own making, who admit their abdication from the realm of the intellect by embracing 
such doctrines as Existentialism and Zen Buddhism. 

After decades of preaching that the hallmark of an intellectual consists of proclaiming the 
impotence of the intellect, these modern zombies are left aghast before the fact that they have 
succeeded — that they are impotent to ignite the lights of civilization, which they have extinguished — 
that they are impotent to halt the triumphant advance of the primordial brute, whom they have released 
— that they have no answer to give to those voices out of the Dark Ages who gloat that reason and 
freedom have had their chance and have failed, and that the future, like the long night of the past, 
belongs once more to faith and force. 

If all the manufacturers of railroad engines suddenly went irrational and began to manufacture 
covered wagons instead, nobody would accept the claim that this is a progressive innovation or that 
the iron horse has failed; and many men would step into the industrial vacuum to start manufacturing 
railroad engines. But when this happens in philosophy — when we are offered Zen Buddhism and its 
equivalents as the latest word in human thought — nobody, so far, has chosen to step into the 
intellectual vacuum to carry on the work of man’s mind. 

Thus our great industrial civilization is now expected to run railroads, airlines, intercontinental 
missiles and H-bomb stock piles by the guidance of philosophical doctrines created by and for 
barefoot savages who lived in mudholes, scratched the soil for a handful of grain and gave thanks to 
the statues of distorted animals whom they worshipped as superior to man. 

Historically, the professional intellectual is a very recent phenomenon: he dates only from the 
industrial revolution. There are no professional intellectuals in primitive, savage societies, there are 
only witch doctors. There were no professional intellectuals in the Middle Ages, there were only 
monks in monasteries. In the post-Renaissance era, prior to the birth of capitalism, the men of the 
intellect — the philosophers, the teachers, the writers, the early scientists — were men without a 
profession, that is: without a socially recognized position, without a market, without a means of 
earning a livelihood. Intellectual pursuits had to depend on the accident of inherited wealth or on the 
favor and financial support of some wealthy protector. And wealth was not earned on an open market, 
either; wealth was acquired by conquest, by force, by political power, or by the favor of those who 



held political power. Tradesmen were more vulnerably and precariously dependent on favor than the 
intellectuals. 

The professional businessman and the professional intellectual came into existence together, as 
brothers born of the industrial revolution. Both are the sons of capitalism — and if they perish, they 
will perish together. The tragic irony will be that they will have destroyed each other; and the major 
share of the guilt will belong to the intellectual. 

With very rare and brief exceptions, pre-capitalist societies had no place for the creative power of 
man’s mind, neither in the creation of ideas nor in the creation of wealth. Reason and its practical 
expression — free trade — were forbidden as a sin and a crime, or were tolerated, usually as ignoble 
activities, under the control of authorities who could revoke the tolerance at whim Such societies 
were ruled by faith and its practical expression: force. There were no makers of knowledge and no 
makers of wealth; there were only witch doctors and tribal chiefs. These two figures dominate every 
anti-rational period of history, whether one calls them tribal chief and witch doctor — or absolute 
monarch and religious leader — or dictator and logical positivist. 

“The tragic joke of human history” — I am quoting John Galt in Atlas Shrugged — “is that on any of 
the altars men erected, it was always man whom they immolated and the animal whom they enshrined. 
It was always the animaTs attributes, not man’s, that humanity worshipped: the idol of instinct and the 
idol of force — the mystics and the kings — the mystics, who longed for an irresponsible consciousness 
and ruled by means of the claim that their dark emotions were superior to reason, that knowledge 
came in blind, causeless fits, blindly to be followed, not doubted — and the kings, who ruled by means 
of claws and muscles, with conquest as their method and looting as their aim, with a club or a gun as 
sole sanction of their power. The defenders of man’s soul were concerned with his feelings, and the 
defenders of man’s body were concerned with his stomach — but both were united against his mind.” 

These two figures — the man of faith and the man of force — are philosophical archetypes, 
psychological symbols and historical reality. As philosophical archetypes, they embody two variants 
of a certain view of man and of existence. As psychological symbols, they represent the basic 
motivation of a great many men who exist in any era, culture or society. As historical reality, they are 
the actual rulers of most of mankind’s societies, who rise to power whenever men abandon reason. - 

The essential characteristics of these two remain the same in all ages: Attila, the man who rules by 
brute force, acts on the range of the moment, is concerned with nothing but the physical reality 
immediately before him, respects nothing but man’s muscles, and regards a fist, a club or a gun as the 
only answer to any problem — and the Witch Doctor, the man who dreads physical reality, dreads the 
necessity of practical action, and escapes into his emotions, into visions of some mystic realm where 
his wishes enjoy a supernatural power unlimited by the absolute of nature. 

Superficially, these two may appear to be opposites, but observe what they have in common: a 
consciousness held down to the perceptual method of functioning, an awareness that does not choose 
to extend beyond the automatic, the immediate, the given, the involuntary, which means: an animal’s 
“epistemology” or as near to it as a human consciousness can come. 

Man’s consciousness shares with animals the first two stages of its development: sensations and 
perceptions; but it is the third state, conceptions, that makes him man. Sensations are integrated into 
perceptions automatically, by the brain of a man or of an animal. But to integrate perceptions into 
conceptions by a process of abstraction, is a feat that man alone has the power to perform — and he 
has to perform it by choice. The process of abstraction, and of concept- formation is a process of 


reason, of thought ; it is not automatic nor instinctive nor involuntary nor infallible. Man has to initiate 
it, to sustain it and to bear responsibility for its results. The pre-conceptual level of consciousness is 
nonvolitional; volition begins with the first syllogism. Man has the choice to think or to evade — to 
maintain a state of full awareness or to drift from moment to moment, in a semi-conscious daze, at the 
mercy of whatever associational whims the unfocused mechanism of his consciousness produces. 

But the living organisms that possess the faculty of consciousness need to exercise it in order to 
survive. An animal’s consciousness functions automatically; an animal perceives what it is able to 
perceive and survives accordingly, no further than the perceptual level permits and no better. Man 
cannot survive on the perceptual level of his consciousness; his senses do not provide him with an 
automatic guidance, they do not give him the knowledge he needs, only the material of knowledge, 
which his mind has to integrate. Man is the only living species who has to perceive reality — which 
means: to be conscious — by choice. But he shares with other species the penalty of unconsciousness: 
destruction. For an animal, the question of survival is primarily physical; for man, primarily 
epistemological. 

Man’s unique reward, however, is that while animals survive by adjusting themselves to their 
background, man survives by adjusting his background to himself. If a drought strikes them, animals 
perish — man builds irrigation canals; if a flood strikes them, animals perish — man builds dams; if a 
carnivorous pack attacks them animals perish — man writes the Constitution of the United States. But 
one does not obtain food, safety or freedom — by instinct. 

It is against this faculty, the faculty of reason, that Attila and the Witch Doctor rebel. The key to 
both their souls is their longing for the effortless, irresponsible, automatic consciousness of an 
animal. Both dread the necessity, the risk and the responsibility of rational cognition. Both dread the 
fact that “nature, to be commanded, must be obeyed.” Both seek to exist, not by conquering nature, but 
by adjusting to the given, the immediate, the known. There is only one means of survival for those 
who do not choose to conquer nature: to conquer those who do. 

The physical conquest of men is Attila’s method of survival. He regards men as others regard fruit 
trees or farm animals: as objects in nature, his for the seizing. But while a good farmer knows, at 
least, that fruit trees and animals have a specific nature and require a specific kind of handling, the 
perceptual mentality of Attila does not extend to so abstract a level: men, to him, are a natural 
phenomenon and an irreducible primary, as all natural phenomena are irreducible primaries to an 
animal. Attila feels no need to understand, to explain, nor even to wonder, how men manage to 
produce the things he covets — “somehow” is a fully satisfactory answer inside his skull, which 
refuses to consider such questions as “how?” and “why?” or such concepts as identity and causality. 
All he needs, his “urges” tell him, is bigger muscles, bigger clubs or a bigger gang than theirs in order 
to seize their bodies and their products, after which their bodies will obey his commands and will 
provide him, somehow, with the satisfaction of any whim. He approaches men as a beast of prey, and 
the consequences of his actions or the possibility of exhausting his victims never enters his 
consciousness, which does not choose to extend beyond the given moment. His view of the universe 
does not include the power of production. The power of destruction, of brute force, is, to him, 
metaphysically omnipotent. 

An Attila never thinks of creating, only of taking over. Whether he conquers a neighboring tribe or 
overruns a continent, material looting is his only goal and it ends with the act of seizure: he has no 
other purpose, no plan, no system to impose on the conquered, no values. His pleasures are closer to 



the level of sensations than of perceptions: food, drink, palatial shelter, rich clothing, indiscriminate 
sex, contests of physical prowess, gambling — all those activities which do not demand or involve the 
use of the conceptual level of consciousness. He does not originate his pleasures: he desires and 
pursues whatever those around him seem to find desirable. Even in the realm of desires, he does not 
create, he merely takes over. 

But a human being cannot live his life moment by moment; a human consciousness preserves a 
certain continuity and demands a certain degree of integration, whether a man seeks it or not. A human 
being needs a frame of reference, a comprehensive view of existence, no matter how rudimentary, 
and, since his consciousness is volitional, a sense of being right , a moral justification of his actions, 
which means: a philosophical code of values. Who, then, provides Attila with values? The Witch 
Doctor. 

If Attila’s method of survival is the conquest of those who conquer nature, the Witch Doctor’s 
method of survival is safer, he believes, and spares him the risks of physical conflict. His method is 
the conquest of those who conquer those who conquer nature. It is not men’s bodies that he seeks to 
rule, but men’s souls. 

To Attila, as to an animal, the phenomena of nature are an irreducible primary. To the Witch Doctor, 
as to an animal, the irreducible primary is the automatic phenomena of his own consciousness. 

An animal has no critical faculty; he has no control over the function of his brain and no power to 
question its content. To an animal, whatever strikes his awareness is an absolute that corresponds to 
reality — or rather, it is a distinction he is incapable of making: reality, to him, is whatever he senses 
or feels. And this is the Witch Doctor’s epistemological ideal, the mode of consciousness he strives 
to induce in himself. To the Witch Doctor, emotions are tools of cognition, and wishes take 
precedence over facts. He seeks to escape the risks of a quest for knowledge by obliterating the 
distinction between consciousness and reality, between the perceiver and the perceived, hoping that 
an automatic certainty and an infallible knowledge of the universe will be granted to him by the blind, 
unfocused stare of his eyes turned inward, contemplating the sensations, the feelings, the urgings, the 
muggy associational twistings projected by the rudderless mechanism of his undirected 
consciousness. Whatever his mechanism produces is an absolute not to be questioned; and whenever 
it clashes with reality, it is reality that he ignores. 

Since the clash is constant, the Witch Doctor’s solution is to believe that what he perceives is 
another, “higher” reality — where his wishes are omnipotent, where contradictions are possible and A 
is non- A, where his assertions, which are false on earth, become true and acquire the status of a 
“superior” truth which he perceives by means of a special faculty denied to other, “inferior,” beings. 
The only validation of his consciousness he can obtain on earth is the belief and the obedience of 
others, when they accept his “truth” as superior to their own perception of reality. While Attila extorts 
their obedience by means of a club, the Witch Doctor obtains it by means of a much more powerful 
weapon: he pre-empts the field of morality. 

There is no way to turn morality into a weapon of enslavement except by divorcing it from man’s 
reason and from the goals of his own existence. There is no way to degrade man’s life on earth except 
by the lethal opposition of the moral and the practical. Morality is a code of values to guide man’s 
choices and actions; when it is set to oppose his own life and mind, it makes him turn against himself 
and blindly act as the tool of his own destruction. There is no way to make a human being accept the 
role of a sacrificial animal except by destroying his self-esteem. There is no way to destroy his self- 



esteem except by making him reject his own consciousness. There is no way to make him reject his 
own consciousness except by convincing him of its impotence. 

The damnation of this earth as a realm where nothing is possible to man but pain, disaster and 
defeat, a realm inferior to another, “higher,” reality; the damnation of all values, enjoyment, 
achievement and success on earth as a proof of depravity; the damnation of man’s mind as a source of 
pride, and the damnation of reason as a “limited,” deceptive, unreliable, impotent faculty, incapable 
of perceiving the “real” reality and the “true” truth; the split of man in two, setting his consciousness 
(his soul) against his body, and his moral values against his own interest; the damnation of man’s 
nature, body and self as evil; the commandment of self-sacrifice, renunciation, suffering, obedience, 
humility and faith, as the good; the damnation of life and the worship of death, with the promise of 
rewards beyond the grave — these are the necessary tenets of the Witch Doctor’s view of existence, as 
they have been in every variant of Witch Doctor philosophy throughout the course of mankind’s 
history. 

The secret of the Witch Doctor’s power lies in the fact that man needs an integrated view of life, a 
philosophy, whether he is aware of his need or not — and whenever, through ignorance, cowardice or 
mental sloth, men choose not to be aware of it, their chronic sense of guilt, uncertainty and terror 
makes them feel that the Witch Doctor’s philosophy is true. 

The first to feel it is Attila. 

The man who lives by brute force, at the whim and mercy of the moment, lives on a narrow island 
suspended in a fog of the unknown, where invisible threats and unpredictable disasters can descend 
upon him any morning. He is willing to surrender his consciousness to the man who offers him 
protection against those intangible questions which he does not wish to consider, yet dreads. 

Attila’s fear of reality is as great as the Witch Doctor’s. Both hold their consciousness on a 
subhuman level and method of functioning: Attila’s brain is a jumble of concretes unintegrated by 
abstractions; the Witch Doctor’s brain is a miasma of floating abstractions unrelated to concretes. 
Both are guided and motivated — ultimately — not by thoughts, but by feelings and whims. Both cling to 
their whims as to their only certainty. Both feel secretly inadequate to the task of dealing with 
existence. 

Thus they come to need each other. Attila feels that the Witch Doctor can give him what he lacks: a 
long-range view, an insurance against the dark unknown of tomorrow or next week or next year, a 
code of moral values to sanction his actions and to disarm his victims. The Witch Doctor feels that 
Attila can give him the material means of survival, can protect him from physical reality, can spare 
him the necessity of practical action, and can enforce his mystic edicts on any recalcitrant who may 
choose to challenge his authority. Both of them are incomplete parts of a human being, who seek 
completion in each other: the man of muscle and the man of feelings, seeking to exist without mind. 

Since no man can fully escape the conceptual level of consciousness, it is not the case that Attila 
and the Witch Doctor cannot or do not think; they can and do — but thinking, to them, is not a means of 
perceiving reality, it is a means of justifying their escape from the necessity of rational perception. 
Reason, to them, is a means of defeating their victims, a menial servant charged with the task of 
rationalizing the metaphysical validity and power of their whims. Just as a bank robber will spend 
years of planning, ingenuity and effort in order to prove to himself that he can exist without effort, so 
both Attila and the Witch Doctor will go to any length of cunning, calculation and thought in order to 
demonstrate the impotence of thought and preserve the image of a pliable universe where miracles are 



possible and whims are efficacious. The power of ideas has no reality for either of them, and neither 
cares to learn that the proof of that power lies in his own chronic sense of guilt and terror. 

Thus Attila and the Witch Doctor form an alliance and divide their respective domains. Attila rules 
the realm of men’s physical existence — the Witch Doctor rules the realm of men’s consciousness. 
Attila herds men into armies — the Witch Doctor sets the armies’ goals. Attila conquers empires — the 
Witch Doctor writes their laws. Attila loots and plunders — the Witch Doctor exhorts the victims to 
surpass their selfish concern with material property. Attila slaughters — the Witch Doctor proclaims to 
the survivors that scourges are a retribution for their sins. Attila rules by means of fear, by keeping 
men under a constant threat of destruction — the Witch Doctor rules by means of guilt, by keeping men 
convinced of their innate depravity impotence and insignificance. Attila turns men’s life on earth into 
a living hell — the Witch Doctor tells them that it could not be otherwise. 

But the alliance of the two rulers is precarious: it is based on mutual fear and mutual contempt. 
Attila is an extrovert, resentful of any concern with consciousness — the Witch Doctor is an introvert, 
resentful of any concern with physical existence. Attila professes scorn for values, ideals, principles, 
theories, abstractions — the Witch Doctor professes scorn for material property, for wealth, for man’s 
body, for this earth. Attila considers the Witch Doctor unpractical — the Witch Doctor considers Attila 
immoral. But, secretly, each of them believes that the other possesses a mysterious faculty he lacks, 
that the other is the true master of reality, the true exponent of the power to deal with existence. In 
terms, not of thought, but of chronic anxiety, it is the Witch Doctor who believes that brute force rules 
the world — and it is Attila who believes in the supernatural; his name for it is “fate” or “luck.” 

Against whom is this alliance formed? Against those men whose existence and character both 
Attila and the Witch Doctor refuse to admit into their view of the universe: the men who produce. In 
any age or society, there are men who think and work, who discover how to deal with existence, how 
to produce the intellectual and the material values it requires. These are the men whose effort is the 
only means of survival for the parasites of all varieties: the Attilas, the Witch Doctors and the human 
ballast. The ballast consists of those who go through life in a state of unfocused stupor, merely 
repeating the words and the motions they learned from others. But the men from whom they learn, the 
men who are first to discover any scrap of new knowledge, are the men who deal with reality, with 
the task of conquering nature, and who, to that extent, assume the responsibility of cognition: of 
exercising their rational faculty. 

A producer is any man who works and knows what he is doing. He may function on a fully human, 
conceptual level of awareness only some part of his time, but, to that extent, he is the Atlas who 
supports the existence of mankind; he may spend the rest of his time in an unthinking daze, like the 
others, and, to that extent, he is the exploited, drained, tortured, self-destroying victim of their 
schemes. 

Men’s epistemology — or, more precisely, their psycho-epistemology, their method of awareness — 
is the most fundamental standard by which they can be classified. Few men are consistent in that 
respect; most men keep switching from one level of awareness to another, according to the 
circumstances or the issues involved, ranging from moments of full rationality to an almost 
somnambulistic stupor. But the battle of human history is fought and determined by those who are 
predominantly consistent, those who, for good or evil, are committed to and motivated by their chosen 
psycho-epistemology and its corollary view of existence — with echoes responding to them, in support 
or opposition, in the switching, flickering souls of the others. 



A man’s method of using his consciousness determines his method of survival. The three 
contestants are Attila, the Witch Doctor and the Producer — or the man of force, the man of feelings, 
the man of reason — or the brute, the mystic, the thinker. The rest of mankind calls it expedient to be 
tossed by the current of events from one of those roles to another, not choosing to identify the fact that 
those three are the source which determines the current’s direction. 

The producers, so far, have been the forgotten men of history. With the exception of a few brief 
periods, the producers have not been the leaders or the term-setters of men’s societies, although the 
degree of their influence and freedom was the degree of a society’s welfare and progress. Most 
societies have been ruled by Attila and the Witch Doctor. The cause is not some innate tendency to 
evil in human nature, but the fact that reason is a volitional faculty which man has to choose to 
discover, employ and preserve. Irrationality is a state of default, the state of an unachieved human 
stature. When men do not choose to reach the conceptual level, their consciousness has no recourse 
but to its automatic, perceptual, semi-animal functions. If a missing link between the human and the 
animal species is to be found, Attila and the Witch Doctor are that missing link — the profiteers on 
men’s default. 

The sound of the first human step in recorded history, the prelude to the entrance of the producer on 
the historical scene, was the birth of philosophy in ancient Greece. All earlier cultures had been 
ruled, not by reason, but by mysticism: the task of philosophy — the formulation of an integrated view 
of man, of existence, of the universe — was the monopoly of various religions that enforced their 
views by the authority of a claim to supernatural knowledge and dictated the rules that controlled 
men’s lives. Philosophy was born in a period when Attila was impotent to assist the Witch Doctor — 
when a comparative degree of political freedom undercut the power of mysticism and, for the first 
time, man was free to face an unobstructed universe, free to declare that his mind was competent to 
deal with all the problems of his existence and that reason was his only means of knowledge. 

Even though the influence of the Witch Doctor’s views permeated the works of the early 
philosophers, reason, for the first time, was identified and acknowledged as man’s ruling faculty, a 
recognition it had never been granted before. Plato’s system was a monument to the Witch Doctor’s 
metaphysics — with its two realities, with the physical world as a semi-illusory, imperfect, inferior 
realm, subordinated to a realm of abstractions (which means, in fact, though not in Plato’s statement: 
subordinated to man’s consciousness), with reason in the position of an inferior but necessary servant 
that paves the way for the ultimate burst of mystic revelation which discloses a “superior” truth. But 
Aristotle’s philosophy was the intellect’s Declaration of Independence. Aristotle, the father of logic, 
should be given the title of the world’s first intellectual, in the purest and noblest sense of that word. 
No matter what remnants of Platonism did exist in Aristotle’s system, his incomparable achievement 
lay in the fact that he defined the basic principles of a rational view of existence and of man’s 
consciousness: that there is only one reality, the one which man perceives — that it exists as an 
objective absolute (which means: independently of the consciousness, the wishes or the feelings of 
any perceiver) — that the task of man’s consciousness is to perceive, not to create, reality — that 
abstractions are man’s method of integrating his sensory material — that man’s mind is his only tool of 
knowledge — that A is A. 

If we consider the fact that to this day everything that makes us civilized beings, every rational 
value that we possess — including the birth of science, the industrial revolution, the creation of the 
United States, even the structure of our language — is the result of Aristotle’s influence, of the degree 



to which, explicitly or implicitly, men accepted his epistemological principles, we would have to 
say: never have so many owed so much to one man. 

Just as the Witch Doctor is impotent without Attila, so Attila is impotent without the Witch Doctor; 
neither can make his power last without the other. Politically, the centuries of the Greco-Roman 
civilization were still dominated by Attila (by the rule of local tyrants or tribal aristocracies), but it 
was a tame, uncertain, subdued Attila, who had to contend with the influence of philosophy (not of 
faith) in men’s minds. The best aspects of Western civilization still owe their roots to the intellectual 
achievements of that era. 

Attila regained his power with the rise of statism in the Roman Empire. What followed was the 
fall of Rome, as a drained hulk, bankrupt in spirit and body, unable to muster any power of resistance 
to the invasion of barbarian hordes — then the looting and devastation of Europe by the literal Attila, 
and the centuries of brute violence, of bloody tribal warfare, of unrecorded chaos, known as the Dark 
Ages. The Witch Doctors were re-emerging, with a new version of mysticism, in answer to the pleas 
for help of the various local Attilas, who were bowing to them voluntarily, in speedy conversions, in 
exchange for the guidance of some form of basic principles to help them stabilize their power. 

The Middle Ages was a period ruled by the Witch Doctor, in a firm, if mutually jealous, alliance 
with Attila. The Witch Doctors controlled every aspect of human life and thought, while the feudal 
Attilas looted one another’s domains, collected material tributes from serfs — who worked, lived and 
starved in subhuman conditions — and maintained the Witch Doctors’ monopoly on spiritual law and 
order, by the power to burn heretics at the stake. 

Philosophy, in that era, existed as a “handmaiden of theology,” and the dominant influence was, 
appropriately, Plato’s in the form of Plotinus and Augustine. Aristotle’s works were lost to the 
scholars of Europe for centuries. The prelude to the Renaissance was the return of Aristotle via 
Thomas Aquinas. 

The Renaissance — the rebirth of man’s mind — blasted the rule of the Witch Doctor sky-high, setting 
the earth free of his power. The liberation was not total, nor was it immediate: the convulsions lasted 
for centuries, but the cultural influence of mysticism — of avowed mysticism — was broken. Men 
could no longer be told to reject their mind as an impotent tool, when the proof of its potency was so 
magnificently evident that the lowest perceptual-level mentality was not able fully to evade it: men 
were seeing the achievements of science. 

The Renaissance did not dethrone Attila at once: he clung to his fading power a while longer, 
building his absolute monarchies on the remnants of his crumbling feudal state. But once again, as in 
the Greco-Roman era, Attila was ineffectual when left on his own. He was mentally helpless and 
scared, unable to cope with the tide of liberation sweeping the world. He ran blindly amuck in the 
practice of his only skill and purpose, that of material extortion, bringing nations to ragged poverty by 
his constant wars and levies, taxing away the last of his subjects’ possessions. But when it came to 
intellectual issues, he kept appeasing the advocates of freedom, he assumed the role of their pupil, 
protector and “patron of the arts,” lapsing occasionally into frantic bursts of censorship and 
persecution, then returning to the role of “enlightened monarch.” Attila, like any bully and like many 
animals, feels confident only when he smells fear in his opponents — and it is not fear that thinkers 
project when they fight for the freedom of the mind. “The divine right of kings” was not much of a 
weapon against men who were discovering the rights of man. 

The industrial revolution completed the task of the Renaissance: it blasted Attila off his throne. For 



the first time in history, men gained control over physical nature and threw off the control of men over 
men — that is: men discovered science and political freedom. 

The first society in history whose leaders were neither Attilas nor Witch Doctors, a society led, 
dominated and created by the Producers, was the United States of America. The moral code implicit 
in its political principles was not the Witch Doctor’s code of self-sacrifice. The political principles 
embodied in its Constitution were not Attila’s blank check on brute force, but men’s protection 
against any future Attila’s ambition. 

The Founding Fathers were neither passive, death-worshipping mystics nor mindless, power- 
seeking looters; as a political group, they were a phenomenon unprecedented in history: they were 
thinkers who were also men of action. They had rejected the soul-body dichotomy, with its two 
corollaries: the impotence of man’s mind and the damnation of this earth; they had rejected the 
doctrine of suffering as man’s metaphysical fate, they proclaimed man’s right to the pursuit of 
happiness and were determined to establish on earth the conditions required for man’s proper 
existence, by the “unaided” power of their intellect. 

A society based on and geared to the conceptual level of man’s consciousness, a society dominated 
by a philosophy of reason, has no place for the rule of fear and guilt. Reason requires freedom, self- 
confidence and self-esteem. It requires the right to think and to act on the guidance of one’s thinking — 
the right to live by one’s own independent judgment. Intellectual freedom cannot exist without 
political freedom; political freedom cannot exist without economic freedom; a free mind and a free 
market are corollaries. 

The unprecedented social system whose fundamentals were established by the Founding Fathers, 
the system which set the terms, the example and the pattern for the nineteenth century — spreading to 
all the countries of the civilized world — was capitalism. 

To be exact, it was not a full, perfect, totally unregulated laissez-faire capitalism. Various degrees 
of government interference and control still remained, even in America, as deadly cracks in the 
system’s foundations. But during the nineteenth century, the world came close to economic freedom, 
for the first and only time in history. The degree of any given country’s economic freedom was the 
exact degree of its progress. America, the freest, achieved the most. 

Capitalism wiped out slavery in matter and in spirit. It replaced Attila and the Witch Doctor, the 
looter of wealth and the purveyor of revelations, with two new types of man: the producer of wealth 
and the purveyor of knowledge — the businessman and the intellectual. 

Capitalism demands the best of every man — his rationality — and rewards him accordingly. It 
leaves every man free to choose the work he likes, to specialize in it, to trade his product for the 
products of others, and to go as far on the road of achievement as his ability and ambition will carry 
him. His success depends on the objective value of his work and on the rationality of those who 
recognize that value. When men are free to trade, with reason and reality as their only arbiter, when 
no man may use physical force to extort the consent of another, it is the best product and the best 
judgment that win in every field of human endeavor, and raise the standard of living — and of thought 
— ever higher for all those who take part in mankind’s productive activity. 

In this complex pattern of human co-operation, two key figures act as the twin- motors of progress, 
the integrators of the entire system, the transmission belts that carry the achievements of the best 
minds to every level of society: the intellectual and the businessman. 

The professional intellectual is the field agent of the army whose commander-in-chief is the 



philosopher. The intellectual carries the application of philosophical principles to every field of 
human endeavor. He sets a society’s course by transmitting ideas from the “ivory tower” of the 
philosopher to the university professor — to the writer — to the artist — to the newspaperman — to the 
politician — to the movie maker — to the night-club singer — to the man in the street. The intellectual’s 
specific professions are in the field of the sciences that study man, the so-called “humanities,” but for 
that very reason his influence extends to all other professions. Those who deal with the sciences 
studying nature have to rely on the intellectual for philosophical guidance and information: for moral 
values, for social theories, for political premises, for psychological tenets and, above all, for the 
principles of epistemology, that crucial branch of philosophy which studies man’s means of 
knowledge and makes all other sciences possible. The intellectual is the eyes, ears and voice of a 
free society: it is his job to observe the events of the world, to evaluate their meaning and to inform 
the men in all the other fields. A free society has to be an informed society. In the stagnation of 
feudalism, with castes and guilds of serfs repeating the same motions generation after generation, the 
services of traveling minstrels chanting the same old legends were sufficient. But in the racing torrent 
of progress which is capitalism, where the free choices of individual men determine their own lives 
and the course of the entire economy, where opportunities are unlimited, where discoveries are 
constant, where the achievements of every profession affect all the others, men need a knowledge 
wider than their particular specialties, they need those who can point the way to the better mousetrap 
— or the better cyclotron, or the better symphony, or the better view of existence. The more 
specialized and diversified a society, the greater its need for the integrating power of knowledge; but 
the acquisition of knowledge on so wide a scale is a full-time profession. A free society has to count 
on the honor of its intellectuals: it has to expect them to be as efficient, reliable, precise and objective 
as the printing presses and the television sets that carry their voices. 

The professional businessman is the field agent of the army whose lieutenant-commander-in-chief 
is the scientist. The businessman carries scientific discoveries from the laboratory of the inventor to 
industrial plants, and transforms them into material products that fill men’s physical needs and expand 
the comfort of men’s existence. By creating a mass market, he makes these products available to every 
income level of society. By using machines, he increases the productivity of human labor, thus raising 
labor’s economic rewards. By organizing human effort into productive enterprises, he creates 
employment for men of countless professions. He is the great liberator who, in the short span of a 
century and a half, has released men from bondage to their physical needs, has released them from the 
terrible drudgery of an eighteen-hour workday of manual labor for their barest subsistence, has 
released them from famines, from pestilences, from the stagnant hopelessness and terror in which 
most of mankind had lived in all the pre-capitalist centuries — and in which most of it still lives, in 
non-capitalist countries. 

It is on this fundamental division of labor and of responsibility that the intellectual has defaulted. 
His twin brother, the businessman, has done a superlative job and has brought men to an 
unprecedented material prosperity. But the intellectual has sold him out, has betrayed their common 
source, has failed in his own job and has brought men to spiritual bankruptcy. The businessman has 
raised men’s standard of living — but the intellectual has dropped men’s standard of thought to the 
level of an impotent savage. 

It has often been noted that mankind has achieved an enormous material progress, but has remained 
on the level of the primitive brute in spirit. (The solution usually offered is to abandon material 



progress.) The cause of the discrepancy is ignored or evaded. The cause is to be found at that 
crossroads of the post-Renaissance period where man’s physical existence and his philosophy broke 
apart and went in different directions. 

Just as a man’s actions are preceded and determined by some form of idea in his mind, so a 
society’s existential conditions are preceded and determined by the ascendancy of a certain 
philosophy among those whose job is to deal with ideas. The events of any given period of history 
are the result of the thinking of the preceding period. The nineteenth century — with its political 
freedom, science, industry, business, trade, all the necessary conditions of material progress — was 
the result and the last achievement of the intellectual power released by the Renaissance. The men 
engaged in those activities were still riding on the remnants of an Aristotelian influence in 
philosophy, particularly on an Aristotelian epistemology (more implicitly than explicitly). But they 
were like men living on the energy of the light rays of a distant star, who did not know (it was not 
their primary task to know) that that star had been extinguished. 

It had been extinguished by those whose primary task was to sustain it. 

From the start of the post-Renaissance period, philosophy — released from its bondage as 
handmaiden of theology — went seeking a new form of servitude, like a frightened slave, broken in 
spirit, who recoils from the responsibility of freedom. Descartes set the direction of the retreat by 
bringing the Witch Doctor back into philosophy. While promising a philosophical system as rational, 
demonstrable and scientific as mathematics, Descartes began with the basic epistemological premise 
of every Witch Doctor (a premise he shared explicitly with Augustine): “the prior certainty of 
consciousness,” the belief that the existence of an external world is not self-evident, but must be 
proved by deduction from the contents of one’s consciousness — which means: the concept of 
consciousness as some faculty other than the faculty of perception — which means: the indiscriminate 
contents of one’s consciousness as the irreducible primary and absolute, to which reality has to 
conform. What followed was the grotesquely tragic spectacle of philosophers struggling to prove the 
existence of an external world by staring, with the Witch Doctor’s blind, inward stare, at the random 
twists of their conceptions — then of perceptions — then of sensations. 

When the medieval Witch Doctor had merely ordered men to doubt the validity of their mind, the 
philosophers’ rebellion against him consisted of proclaiming that they doubted whether man was 
conscious at all and whether anything existed for him to be conscious of. 

It is at this point that Attila entered the philosophical scene. 

Attila — the type of man who longs to live on the perceptual level of consciousness, without the 
“interference” of any concepts, to act on the whim and range of the moment, without the “hampering 
restriction” of principles or theories, without the necessity of integrating one experience with another 
or one moment with the next — saw his chance to escape from his subservience to the Witch Doctor, 
which he had always resented (to muscle in on the racket, one would have to say), and to obtain from 
science the sanction of his actions and of his psycho-epistemology. Attila, who hated and feared 
intellectual issues, saw his chance to take over the intellect and found his voice. 

When Hume declared that he saw objects moving about, but never saw such a thing as 
“causality” — it was the voice of Attila that men were hearing. It was Attila’s soul that spoke when 
Hume declared that he experienced a flow of fleeting states inside his skull, such as sensations, 
feelings or memories, but had never caught the experience of such a thing as consciousness or self. 
When Hume declared that the apparent existence of an object did not guarantee that it would not 



vanish spontaneously next moment, and the sunrise of today did not prove that the sun would rise 
tomorrow; when he declared that philosophical speculation was a game, like chess or hunting, of no 
significance whatever to the practical course of human existence, since reason proved that existence 
was unintelligible and only the ignorant maintained the illusion of knowledge — all of this 
accompanied by vehement opposition to the mysticism of the Witch Doctor and by protestations of 
loyalty to reason and science — what men were hearing was the manifesto of a philosophical 
movement that can be designated only as Attila-ism. 

If it were possible for an animal to describe the content of his consciousness, the result would be a 
transcript of Hume’s philosophy Hume’s conclusions would be the conclusions of a consciousness 
limited to the perceptual level of awareness, passively reacting to the experience of immediate 
concretes, with no capacity to form abstractions, to integrate perceptions into concepts, waiting in 
vain for the appearance of an object labeled “causality” (except that such a consciousness would not 
be able to draw conclusions). 

To negate man’s mind, it is the conceptual level of his consciousness that has to be invalidated. 
Under all the tortuous complexities, contradictions, equivocations, rationalizations of the post- 
Renaissance philosophy — the one consistent line, the fundamental that explains the rest, is: a 
concerted attack on man’s conceptual faculty. Most philosophers did not intend to invalidate 
conceptual knowledge, but its defenders did more to destroy it than did its enemies. They were unable 
to offer a solution to the “problem of universals,” that is: to define the nature and source of 
abstractions, to determine the relationship of concepts to perceptual data — and to prove the validity 
of scientific induction. Ignoring the lead of Aristotle, who had not left them a full answer to the 
problem, but had shown the direction and the method by which the answer could be found, the 
philosophers were unable to refute the Witch Doctor’s claim that their concepts were as arbitrary as 
his whims and that their scientific knowledge had no greater metaphysical validity than his 
revelations. 

The philosophers chose to solve the problem by conceding the Witch Doctor’s claim and by 
surrendering to him the conceptual level of man’s consciousness — a victory no Witch Doctor could 
have hoped to achieve on his own. The form of that absurd concession was the philosophers’ ultimate 
division into two camps: those who claimed that man obtains his knowledge of the world by deducing 
it exclusively from concepts, which come from inside his head and are not derived from the 
perception of physical facts (the Rationalists) — and those who claimed that man obtains his 
knowledge from experience, which was held to mean: by direct perception of immediate facts, with 
no recourse to concepts (the Empiricists). To put it more simply: those who joined the Witch Doctor, 
by abandoning reality — and those who clung to reality, by abandoning their mind. 

Thus reason was pushed off the philosophical scene, by default, by implication, by evasion. What 
had started as a serious problem between two camps of serious thinkers soon degenerated to the level 
where nothing was left on the field of philosophy but a battle between Witch Doctors and Attila-ists. 

The man who formalized this state, and closed the door of philosophy to reason, was Immanuel 
Kant. 

Kant gave metaphysical expression to the psycho-epistemology of Attila and the Witch Doctor and 
to their primordial existential relationship, shutting out of his universe the existence and the psycho- 
epistemology of the Producer. He surrendered philosophy to Attila — and insured its future delivery 
back into the power of the Witch Doctor. He turned the world over to Attila, but reserved to the Witch 



Doctor the realm of morality. Kant’s expressly stated purpose was to save the morality of self- 
abnegation and self-sacrifice. He knew that it could not survive without a mystic base — and what it 
had to be saved from was reason. 

Attila’s share of Kant’s universe includes this earth, physical reality, man’s senses, perceptions, 
reason and science, all of it labeled the “phenomenal” world. The Witch Doctor’s share is another, 
“higher,” reality, labeled the “noumenal” world, and a special manifestation, labeled the “categorical 
imperative,” which dictates to man the rules of morality and which makes itself known by means of a 
feeling, as a special sense of duty. 

The “phenomenal” world, said Kant, is not real: reality, as perceived by man’s mind, is a 
distortion. The distorting mechanism is man’s conceptual faculty: man’s basic concepts (such as time, 
space, existence) are not derived from experience or reality, but come from an automatic system of 
filters in his consciousness (labeled “categories” and “forms of perception”) which impose their own 
design on his perception of the external world and make him incapable of perceiving it in any manner 
other than the one in which he does perceive it. This proves, said Kant, that man’s concepts are only a 
delusion, but a collective delusion which no one has the power to escape. Thus reason and science 
are “limited,” said Kant; they are valid only so long as they deal with this world, with a permanent, 
pre-determined collective delusion (and thus the criterion of reason’s validity was switched from the 
objective to the collective ), but they are impotent to deal with the fundamental, metaphysical issues of 
existence, which belong to the “noumenal” world. The “noumenal” world is unknowable; it is the 
world of “real” reality, “superior” truth and “things in themselves” or “things as they are” — which 
means: things as they are not perceived by man. 

Even apart from the fact that Kant’s theory of the “categories” as the source of man’s concepts was 
a preposterous invention, his argument amounted to a negation, not only of man’s consciousness, but 
of any consciousness, of consciousness as such. His argument, in essence, ran as follows: man is 
limited to a consciousness of a specific nature, which perceives by specific means and no others, 
therefore, his consciousness is not valid; man is blind, because he has eyes — deaf, because he has 
ears — deluded, because he has a mind — and the things he perceives do not exist, because he 
perceives them. 

As to Kant’s version of morality, it was appropriate to the kind of zombies that would inhabit that 
kind of universe: it consisted of total, abject selflessness. An action is moral, said Kant, only if one 
has no desire to perform it, but performs it out of a sense of duty and derives no benefit from it of any 
sort, neither material nor spiritual; a benefit destroys the moral value of an action. (Thus, if one has 
no desire to be evil, one cannot be good; if one has, one can.) 

Those who accept any part of Kant’s philosophy — metaphysical, epistemological or moral — 
deserve it. 

If one finds the present state of the world unintelligible and inexplicable, one can begin to 
understand it by realizing that the dominant intellectual influence today is still Kant’s — and that all the 
leading modern schools of philosophy are derived from a Kantian base. 

The popular slang expression “head-shrinker,” applied to psychologists, is much more literally 
applicable to Kant: observe the sharp drop in the intellectual stature of the post- Kantian philosophers, 
and the progressively thickening veil of grayness, superficiality, casuistry that descends on the history 
of philosophy thereafter — like a fog enveloping a sluggish river that runs thinner and thinner and 
finally vanishes in the swamps of the twentieth century. 



The major line of philosophers rejected Kant’s “noumenal” world quite speedily, but they accepted 
his “phenomenal” world and carried it to its logical consequences: the view of reality as mere 
appearance; the view of man’s conceptual faculty as a mechanism for producing arbitrary 
“constructs” not derived from experience or facts; the view of rational certainty as impossible, of 
science as unprovable, of man’s mind as impotent — and, above all, the equation of morality with 
selflessness. They rejected the root or cause of Kant’s system, but accepted all of its deadly effects. 
They accepted it as some monstrous spider hanging in midair, in a web of unintelligible, almost 
unreadable verbiage — and, today, few people know that that spider is not supported by a single 
thread of proof. 

Such was the intellectual equipment with which philosophers approached the task of observing the 
unprecedented historical events of the nineteenth century, and the responsibility of providing guidance 
for the new, free society of capitalism. 

While scientists were performing astounding feats of disciplined reason, breaking down the 
barriers of the “unknowable” in every field of knowledge, charting the course of light rays in space or 
the course of blood in the capillaries of man’s body — what philosophy was offering them, as 
interpretation of and guidance for their achievements, was the plain Witch- doctory of Hegel, who 
proclaimed that matter does not exist at all, that everything is Idea (not somebody’s idea, just Idea), 
and that this Idea operates by the dialectical process of a new “super-logic” which proves that 
contradictions are the law of reality, that A is non-A, and that omniscience about the physical 
universe (including electricity, gravitation, the solar system, etc.) is to be derived, not from the 
observation of facts, but from the contemplation of that Idea’s triple somersaults inside his, Hegel’s, 
mind. This was offered as a philosophy of reason. 

While businessmen were rising to spectacular achievements of creative ability and self-confidently 
ambitious courage, challenging the primordial dogma of man’s poverty and misery on earth, breaking 
open the trade routes of the world, releasing mankind’s productive energy and placing in its service 
the liberating power of machines (against the scornful resistance of loafing, ex- feudal aristocrats and 
the destructive violence of those who were to profit most: the workers) — what philosophy was 
offering, as an evaluation of their achievements and as guidance for the rest of society, was the pure 
Attila-ism of Marx, who proclaimed that the mind does not exist, that everything is matter, that matter 
develops itself by the dialectical process of its own “super-logic” of contradictions, and what is true 
today, will not be true tomorrow, that the material tools of production determine men’s “ideological 
superstructure” (which means: machines create men’s thinking, not the other way around), that 
muscular labor is the source of wealth, that physical force is the only practical means of existence, 
and that the seizure of the omnipotent machines will transfer omnipotence to the rule of brute 
violence. Never had Attila’s psycho-epistemology been transcribed so accurately. This was offered 
as a philosophy of history and of political economy. 

What was offered as philosophical antidote to those who would not accept these theories? 

As a defense against the Witch-doctory of Kant and Hegel, the businessman was offered the neo- 
mystic Attila-ism of the Pragmatists. They declared that philosophy must be practical and that 
practicality consists of dispensing with all absolute principles and standards — that there is no such 
thing as objective reality or permanent truth — that truth is that which works, and its validity can be 
judged only by its consequences — that no facts can be known with certainty in advance, and anything 
may be tried by rule-of-thumb — that reality is not firm, but fluid and “indeterminate,” that there is no 



such thing as a distinction between an external world and a consciousness (between the perceived 
and the perceiver), there is only an undifferentiated package-deal labeled “experience,” and whatever 
one wishes to be true, is true, whatever one wishes to exist, does exist, provided it works or makes 
one feel better. 

A later school of more Kantian Pragmatists amended this philosophy as follows. If there is no such 
thing as an objective reality, men’s metaphysical choice is whether the selfish, dictatorial whims of an 
individual or the democratic whims of a collective are to shape that plastic goo which the ignorant 
call “reality”; therefore this school decided that objectivity consists of collective subjectivism — that 
knowledge is to be gained by means of public polls among special elites of “competent investigators” 
who can “predict and control” reality — that whatever people wish to be true, is true, whatever people 
wish to exist, does exist, and anyone who holds any firm convictions of his own is an arbitrary, 
mystic dogmatist, since reality is indeterminate and people determine its actual nature. 

The scientist was offered a slightly different version of philosophy. As a defense against the 
Witch-doctory of Hegel, who claimed universal omniscience, the scientist was offered the combined 
neo-mystic Witch-doctory and Attila-ism of the Logical Positivists. They assured him that such 
concepts as metaphysics or existence or reality or thing or matter or mind are meaningless — let the 
mystics care whether they exist or not, a scientist does not have to know it; the task of theoretical 
science is the manipulation of symbols, and scientists are the special elite whose symbols have the 
magic power of making reality conform to their will (“matter is that which fits mathematical 
equations”). Knowledge, they said, consists, not of facts, but of words, words unrelated to objects, 
words of an arbitrary social convention, as an irreducible primary; thus knowledge is merely a matter 
of manipulating language. The job of scientists, they said, is not the study of reality, but the creation of 
arbitrary constructs by means of arbitrary sounds, and any construct is as valid as another, since the 
criterion of validity is only “convenience” and the definition of science is “that which the scientists 
do.” But this omnipotent power, surpassing the dreams of ancient numerologists or of medieval 
alchemists, was granted to the scientist by philosophical Attila-ism on two conditions: a. that he 
never claim certainty for his knowledge, since certainty is unknowable to man, and that he claim, 
instead, “percentages of probability,” not troubling himself with such questions as how one calculates 
percentages of the unknowable; b. that he claim as absolute knowledge the proposition that all values 
lie outside the sphere of science, that reason is impotent to deal with morality, that moral values are a 
matter of subjective choice, dictated by one’s feelings, not one’s mind. 

The great treason of the philosophers was that they never stepped out of the Middle Ages: they 
never challenged the Witch Doctor’s code of morality. They were willing to doubt the existence of 
physical objects, they were willing to doubt the validity of their own senses, they were willing to 
defy the authority of absolute monarchies, they were willing (occasionally) to proclaim themselves to 
be skeptics or agnostics or atheists — but they were not willing to doubt the doctrine that man is a 
sacrificial animal, that he has no right to exist for his own sake, that service to others is the only 
justification of his existence and that self-sacrifice is his highest moral duty, virtue and value. 

Under all its countless guises, variations and adaptations, that doctrine — best designated as the 
morality of altruism — has come from prehistoric swamps to New York City, unchanged. In savage 
societies, men practiced the ritual of human sacrifices, immolating individual men on sacrificial 
altars, for the sake of what they regarded as their collective, tribal good. Today, they are still doing it, 
only the agony is slower and the slaughter greater — but the doctrine that demands it and sanctions it, 



is the same doctrine of moral cannibalism. 

The philosophers preserved it, by leaving the subject of morality to the mystics — or by consigning 
it to the province of subjective feelings, which means: to the mystics — or by the vehement rejection 
of reason’s capacity to deal with moral values and the branding of all value -judgments as 
“unscientific,” which means: the re-affirmation and perpetuation of the mystics’ monopoly on morality 
— or, worst of all, by accepting the mystics’ moral code in its irrational entirety, then translating it 
into earthly terms and propagating it in the name of reason. 

The convolutions of this last attempt provide what is, perhaps, the most grotesquely terrible 
chapter in the history of Western thought. The political “me-too-ism,” abjectly displayed by the 
“conservatives” of today toward their brazenly socialistic adversaries, is only the result and the 
feeble reflection of the ethical “me-too-ism” displayed by the philosophers of the nineteenth and 
twentieth centuries, by the alleged champions of reason, toward the Witch Doctors of morality. 

Auguste Comte, the founder of Positivism, the champion of science, advocated a “rational,” 
“scientific” social system based on the total subjugation of the individual to the collective, including 
a “Religion of Humanity” which substituted Society for the Gods or gods who collect the blood of 
sacrificial victims. It is not astonishing that Comte was the coiner of the term Altruism, which means: 
the placing of others above self, of their interests above one’s own. 

Nietzsche’s rebellion against altruism consisted of replacing the sacrifice of oneself to others by 
the sacrifice of others to oneself. He proclaimed that the ideal man is moved, not by reason, but by his 
“blood,” by his innate instincts, feelings and will to power — that he is predestined by birth to rule 
others and sacrifice them to himself, while they are predestined by birth to be his victims and slaves 
— that reason, logic, principles are futile and debilitating, that morality is useless, that the “superman” 
is “beyond good and evil,” that he is a “beast of prey” whose ultimate standard is nothing but his own 
whim. Thus Nietzsche’s rejection of the Witch Doctor consisted of elevating Attila into a moral ideal 
— which meant: a double surrender of morality to the Witch Doctor. 

Jeremy Bentham, the champion of capitalism, defended it by proclaiming “the greatest happiness of 
the greatest number” as its moral justification — and pro-pounded a “hedonistic calculus” for men’s 
moral guidance, which enunciated the principle that before taking any action one must consider all the 
possible forms and amounts of happiness and unhappiness to accrue to all the people possibly to be 
affected by the consequences of one’s action (including oneself as one unit among the dozens or 
hundreds or millions), one must compute them all, then act accordingly and sacrifice the “hedonistic” 
minority to the majority. 

Herbert Spencer, another champion of capitalism, chose to decide that the theory of evolution and 
of adaptation to environment was the key to man’s morality — and declared that the moral justification 
of capitalism was the survival of the species, of the human race; that whoever was of no value to the 
race, had to perish; that man’s morality consisted of adapting oneself to one’s social environment, and 
seeking one’s own happiness in the welfare of society; and that the automatic processes of evolution 
would eventually obliterate the distinction between selfishness and unselfishness. 

And when Karl Marx, the most consistent translator of the altruist morality into practical action and 
political theory, advocated a society where all would be sacrificed to all, starting with the immediate 
immolation of the able, the intelligent, the successful and the wealthy — whatever opposition he did 
encounter, nobody opposed him on moral grounds. Predominantly, he was granted the status of a 
noble, but impractical, idealist. 



The great treason of the philosophers was that they, the thinkers, defaulted on the responsibility of 
providing a rational society with a code of rational morality. They, whose job it was to discover and 
define man’s moral values, stared at the brilliant torrent of man’s released energy and had nothing 
better to offer for its guidance than the Witch Doctor’s morality of human sacrifices — of self-denial, 
self-abasement, self-immolation — of suffering, guilt and death. 

The failure of philosophers to challenge the Witch Doctor’s morality, has cost them their kingdom: 
philosophy The relationship of reason and morality is reciprocal: the man who accepts the role of a 
sacrificial animal, will not achieve the self-confidence necessary to uphold the validity of his mind — 
the man who doubts the validity of his mind, will not achieve the self-esteem necessary to uphold the 
value of his person and to discover the moral premises that make man’s value possible. 

The intellectuals share the philosophers’ guilt. The intellectuals — all those whose professions deal 
with the “humanities” and require a firm philosophical base — have known for a long time that no such 
base existed. They knew that they were functioning in a philosophical vacuum and that the currency 
they were passing was rubber checks which would bounce, some day, wrecking their culture. 

One can never know, only surmise, what tragedies, despair and silent devastation have been going 
on for over a century in the invisible underground of the intellectual professions — in the souls of their 
practitioners — nor what incalculable potential of human ability and integrity perished in those hidden, 
lonely conflicts. The young minds who came to the field of the intellect with the inarticulate sense of a 
crusade, seeking rational answers to the problems of achieving a meaningful human existence, found a 
philosophical con game in place of guidance and leadership. Some of them gave up the field of ideas, 
in hopeless, indignant frustration, and vanished into the silence of subjectivity. Others gave in, and 
saw their eagerness turn into bitterness, their quest into apathy, their crusade into a cynical racket. 
They condemned themselves to the chronic anxiety of a con man dreading exposure when they 
accepted the roles of enlightened leaders, while knowing that their knowledge rested on nothing but 
fog and that its only validation was somebody’s feelings. 

They, the standard bearers of the mind, found themselves dreading reason as an enemy, logic as a 
pursuer, thought as an avenger. They, the proponents of ideas, found themselves clinging to the belief 
that ideas were impotent: their choice was the futility of a charlatan or the guilt of a traitor. They were 
not mediocrities when they began their careers; they were pretentious mediocrities when they ended. 
The exceptions are growing rarer with every generation. No one can accept with psychological 
impunity the function of a Witch Doctor under the banner of the intellect. 

With nothing but quicksands to stand on — the shifting mixture of Witch-doctory and Attila-ism as 
their philosophical base — the intellectuals were unable to grasp, to identify or to evaluate the 
historical drama taking place before them: the industrial revolution and capitalism. They were like 
men who did not see the splendor of a rocket bursting over their heads, because their eyes were 
lowered in guilt. It was their job to see and to explain — to a society of men stumbling dazedly out of 
a primeval dungeon — the cause and the meaning of the events that were sweeping them faster and 
farther than the motion of all the centuries behind them. The intellectuals did not choose to see. 

The men in the other professions were not able to step back and observe. If some men found 
themselves leaving their farms for a chance to work in a factory, that was all they knew. If their 
children now had a chance to survive beyond the age of ten (child mortality had been about fifty 
percent in the pre-capitalist era), they were not able to identify the cause. They could not tell why the 
periodic famines — that had been striking every twenty years to wipe out the “surplus” population 



which pre-capitalist economies could not feed — now came to an end, as did the carnages of religious 
wars, nor why fear seemed to be lifting away from people’s voices and from the streets of growing 
cities, nor why an enormous exultation was suddenly sweeping the world. The intellectuals did not 
choose to tell them. 

The intellectuals, or their predominant majority, remained centuries behind their time: still seeking 
the favor of noble protectors, some of them were bewailing the “vulgarity” of commercial pursuits, 
scoffing at those whose wealth was “new,” and, simultaneously, blaming these new wealth-makers for 
all the poverty inherited from the centuries ruled by the owners of nobly “noncommercial” wealth. 
Others were denouncing machines as “inhuman,” and factories as a blemish on the beauty of the 
countryside (where gallows had formerly stood at the crossroads). Still others were calling for a 
movement “back to nature,” to the handicrafts, to the Middle Ages. And some were attacking 
scientists for inquiring into forbidden “mysteries” and interfering with God’s design. 

The victim of the intellectuals’ most infamous injustice was the businessman. 

Having accepted the premises, the moral values and the position of Witch Doctors, the intellectuals 
were unwilling to differentiate between the businessman and Attila, between the producer of wealth 
and the looter. Like the Witch Doctor, they scorned and dreaded the realm of material reality, feeling 
secretly inadequate to deal with it. Like the Witch Doctor’s, their secret vision (almost their feared 
and envied ideal) of a practical, successful man, a true master of reality, was Attila; like the Witch 
Doctor, they believed that force, fraud, lies, plunder, expropriation, enslavement, murder were 
practical. So they did not inquire into the source of wealth or ever ask what made it possible (they 
had been taught that causality is an illusion and that only the immediate moment is real). They took it 
as their axiom, as an irreducible primary, that wealth can be acquired only by force — and that a 
fortune as such is the proof of plunder, with no further distinctions or inquiries necessary. 

With their eyes still fixed on the Middle Ages, they were maintaining this in the midst of a period 
when a greater amount of wealth than had ever before existed in the world was being brought into 
existence all around them. If the men who produced that wealth were thieves, from whom had they 
stolen it? Under all the shameful twists of their evasions, the intellectuals’ answer was: from those 
who had not produced it. They were refusing to acknowledge the industrial revolution (they are still 
refusing today). They were refusing to admit into their universe what neither Attila nor the Witch 
Doctor can afford to admit: the existence of man, the Producer. 

Evading the difference between production and looting, they called the businessman a robber. 
Evading the difference between freedom and compulsion, they called him a slave driver. Evading the 
difference between reward and terror, they called him an exploiter. Evading the difference between 
pay checks and guns, they called him an autocrat. Evading the difference between trade and force, 
they called him a tyrant. The most crucial issue they had to evade was the difference between the 
earned and the unearned. 

Ignoring the existence of the faculty they were betraying, the faculty of discrimination, the intellect, 
they refused to identify the fact that industrial wealth was the product of man’s mind: that an 
incalculable amount of intellectual power, of creative intelligence, of disciplined energy, of human 
genius had gone into the creation of industrial fortunes. They could not afford to identify it, because 
they could not afford to admit the fact that the intellect is a practical faculty, a guide to man’s 
successful existence on earth, and that its task is the study of reality (as well as the production of 
wealth), not the contemplation of unintelligible feelings nor a special monopoly on the “unknowable.” 



The Witch Doctor’s morality of altruism — the morality that damns all those who achieve success or 
enjoyment on earth — provided the intellectuals with the means to make a virtue of evasion. It gave 
them a weapon that disarmed their victims; it gave them an automatic substitute for self-esteem, and a 
chance at an unearned moral stature. They proclaimed themselves to be the defenders of the poor 
against the rich, righteously evading the fact that the rich were not Attilas any longer — and the 
defenders of the weak against the strong, righteously evading the fact that the strength involved was 
not the strength of brute muscles any longer, but the strength of man’s mind. 

But while the intellectuals regarded the businessman as Attila, the businessman would not behave 
as they, from the position of Witch Doctors, expected Attila to behave: he was impervious to their 
power. The businessman was as bewildered by events as the rest of mankind, he had no time to grasp 
his own historical role, he had no moral weapons, no voice, no defense, and — knowing no morality 
but the altruist code, yet knowing also that he was functioning against it, that self-sacrifice was not his 
role — he was helplessly vulnerable to the intellectuals’ attack. He would have welcomed eagerly the 
guidance of Aristotle, but had no use for Immanuel Kant. That which today is called “common sense” 
is the remnant of an Aristotelian influence, and that was the businessman’s only form of philosophy. 
The businessman asked for proof and expected things to make sense — an expectation that kicked the 
intellectuals into the category of the unemployed. They had nothing to offer to a man who did not buy 
any shares of any version of the “noumenal” world. 

To understand the course the intellectuals chose to take, it is important to remember the Witch 
Doctor’s psycho-epistemology and his relationship to Attila: the Witch Doctor expects Attila to be his 
protector against reality, against the necessity of rational cognition, and, at the same time, he expects 
to rule his own protector, who needs an unintelligible mystic sanction as a narcotic to relieve his 
chronic guilt. They derive their mutual security, not from any form of strength, but from the fact that 
each has a hold on the other’s secret weakness. It is not the security of two traders, who count on the 
values they offer each other, but the security of two blackmailers, who count on each other’s fear. 

The Witch Doctor feels like a metaphysical outcast in a capitalist society — as if he were pushed 
into some limbo outside of any universe he cares to recognize. He has no means to deal with 
innocence; he can get no hold on a man who does not seek to live in guilt, on a businessman who is 
confident of his ability to earn his living — who takes pride in his work and in the value of his product 
— who drives himself with inexhaustible energy and limitless ambition to do better and still better 
and ever better — who is willing to bear penalties for his mistakes and expects rewards for his 
achievements — who looks at the universe with the fearless eagerness of a child, knowing it to be 
intelligible — who demands straight lines, clear terms, precise definitions — who stands in lull sunlight 
and has no use for the murky fog of the hidden, the secret, the unnamed, the furtively evocative, for 
any code of signals from the psycho-epistemology of guilt. 

What the businessman offered to the intellectuals was the spiritual counterpart of his own activity, 
that which the Witch Doctor dreads most: the freedom of the market place of ideas. 

To live by the work of one’s mind, to offer men the products of one’s thinking, to provide them with 
new knowledge, to stand on nothing but the merit of one’s ideas and to rely on nothing but objective 
truth, in a market open to any man who is willing to think and has to judge, accept or reject on his own 
— is a task that only a man on the conceptual level of psycho-epistemology can welcome or fulfill. It 
is not the place for a Witch Doctor nor for any mystic “elite.” A Witch Doctor has to live by the favor 
of a protector, by a special dispensation, by a reserved monopoly, by exclusion, by suppression, by 



censorship. 

Having accepted the philosophy and the psycho-epistemology of the Witch Doctor, the intellectuals 
had to cut the ground from under their own feet and turn against their own historical distinction: 
against the first chance men had ever had to make a professional living by means of the intellect. 
When the intellectuals rebelled against the “commercialism” of a capitalist society, what they were 
specifically rebelling against was the open market of ideas, where feelings were not accepted and 
ideas were expected to demonstrate their validity, where the risks were great, injustices were 
possible and no protector existed but objective reality. 

Just as Attila, since the Renaissance, was looking for a Witch Doctor of his own, so the 
intellectuals, since the industrial revolution, were looking for an Attila of their own. The altruist 
morality brought them together and gave them the weapon they needed. The field where they found 
each other was socialism. 

It was not the businessmen or the industrialists or the workers or the labor unions or the remnants 
of the feudal aristocracy that began the revolt against freedom and the demand for the return of the 
absolute state: it was the intellectuals. It was the alleged guardians of reason who brought mankind 
back to the rule of brute force. 

Growing throughout the nineteenth century, originated in and directed from intellectual salons, 
sidewalk cafes, basement beer joints and university classrooms, the industrial counter-revolution 
united the Witch Doctors and the Attila-ists. They demanded the right to enforce ideas at the point of a 
gun, that is: through the power of government, and compel the submission of others to the views and 
wishes of those who would gain control of the government’s machinery. They extolled the State as the 
“Form of the Good,” with man as its abject servant, and they proposed as many variants of the 
socialist state as there had been of the altruist morality. But, in both cases, the variations merely 
played with the surface, while the cannibal essence remained the same: socialism is the doctrine that 
man has no right to exist for his own sake, that his life and his work do not belong to him, but belong 
to society, that the only justification of his existence is his service to society, and that society may 
dispose of him in any way it pleases for the sake of whatever it deems to be its own tribal, collective 
good. 

It is only the Attila-ist, pragmatist, positivist, anti-conceptual mentality — which grants no validity 
to abstractions, no meaning to principles and no power to ideas — that can still wonder why a 
theoretical doctrine of that kind had to lead in practice to the torrent of blood and brute, non-human 
horror of such socialist societies as Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia. Only the Attila-ist mentality 
can still claim that nobody can prove that these had to be the necessary results — or still try to blame 
it on the “imperfection” of human nature or on the evil of some specific gang who “betrayed a noble 
ideal,” and still promise that its own gang would do it better and make it work — or still mumble in a 
quavering voice that the motive was love of humanity. 

The pretenses have worn thin, the evasions do not work any longer; the intellectuals are aware of 
their guilt, but are still struggling to evade its cause and to pass it on to the universe at large, to man’s 
metaphysically predestined impotence. 

Guilt and fear are the disintegrators of a man’s consciousness or of a society’s culture. Today, 
America’s culture is being splintered into disintegration by the three injunctions which permeate our 
intellectual atmosphere and which are typical of guilt: don’t look — don’t judge — don’t be certain. 

The psycho-epistemological meaning and implementation of these three are: don’t integrate — don’t 



evaluate — give up. 

The last stand of Attila-ism, both in philosophy and in science, is the concerted assertion of all the 
neo-mystics that integration is impossible and unscientific. The escape from the conceptual level of 
consciousness, the progressive contraction of man’s vision down to Attila’s range, has now reached 
its ultimate climax. Withdrawing from reality and responsibility, the neo-mystics proclaim that no 
entities exist, only relationships, and that one may study relationships without anything to relate, and, 
simultaneously, that every datum is single and discrete, and no datum can ever be related to any other 
data — that context is irrelevant, that anything may be proved or disproved in midair and midstream, 
and the narrower the subject of study, the better — that myopia is the hallmark of a thinker or a 
scientist. 

System-building — the integration of knowledge into a coherent sum and a consistent view of reality 
— is denounced by all the Attila-ists as irrational, mystical and unscientific. This is Attila’s perennial 
way of surrendering to the Witch Doctor — and it explains why so many scientists are turning to God 
or to such flights of mysticism of their own as would make even an old-fashioned Witch Doctor blush. 
No consciousness can accept disintegration as a normal and permanent state. Science was born as a 
result and consequence of philosophy; it cannot survive without a philosophical (particularly 
epistemological) base. If philosophy perishes, science will be next to go. 

The abdication of philosophy is all but complete. Today’s philosophers, qua Witch Doctors, 
declare that nobody can define what is philosophy or what is its specific task, but this need not 
prevent anyone from practicing it as a profession. Qua Attila-ists, they declare that the use of wide 
abstractions or concepts is the prerogative of the layman or of the ignorant or of the man in the street 
— while a philosopher is one who, knowing all the difficulties involved in the problem of 
abstractions, deals with nothing but concretes. 

The injunction “don’t judge” is the ultimate climax of the altruist morality which, today, can be 
seen in its naked essence. When men plead for forgiveness, for the nameless, cosmic forgiveness of 
an unconfessed evil, when they react with instantaneous compassion to any guilt, to the perpetrators of 
any atrocity, while turning away indifferently from the bleeding bodies of the victims and the innocent 
— one may see the actual purpose, motive and psychological appeal of the altruist code. When these 
same compassionate men turn with snarling hatred upon anyone who pronounces moral judgments, 
when they scream that the only evil is the determination to fight against evil — one may see the kind of 
moral blank check that the altruist morality hands out. 

Perhaps the most craven attitude of all is the one expressed by the injunction “don’t be certain.” As 
stated explicitly by many intellectuals, it is the suggestion that if nobody is certain of anything, if 
nobody holds any firm convictions, if everybody is willing to give in to everybody else, no dictator 
will rise among us and we will escape the destruction sweeping the rest of the world. This is the 
secret voice of the Witch Doctor confessing that he sees a dictator, an Attila, as a man of confident 
strength and uncompromising conviction. Nothing but a psycho-epistemological panic can blind such 
intellectuals to the fact that a dictator, like any thug, runs from the first sign of confident resistance; 
that he can rise only in a society of precisely such uncertain, compliant, shaking compromisers as they 
advocate, a society that invites a thug to take over; and that the task of resisting an Attila can be 
accomplished only by men of intransigent conviction and moral certainty — not by chickens hiding 
their heads in the sand (“ostrich” is too big and dignified a metaphor for this instance). 

And, paving the way for Attila, the intellectuals are still repeating, not by conviction any longer, 



but by rote, that the growth of government power is not an abridgment of freedom — that the demand of 
one group for an unearned share of another group’s income is not socialism — that the destruction of 
property rights will not affect any other rights — that man’s mind, intelligence, creative ability are a 
“national resource ” (like mines, forests, waterfalls, buffalo reserves and national parks) to be taken 
over, subsidized and disposed of by the government — that businessmen are selfish autocrats because 
they are struggling to preserve freedom, while the “liberals” are the true champions of liberty because 
they are fighting for more government controls — that the fact that we are sliding down a road which 
has destroyed every other country, does not prove that it will destroy ours — that dictatorship is not 
dictatorship if nobody calls it by that abstract name — and that none of us can help it, anyway 

Nobody believes any of it any longer, yet nobody opposes it. To oppose anything, one needs a firm 
set of principles, which means: a philosophy 

If America perishes, it will perish by intellectual default. There is no diabolical conspiracy to 
destroy it: no conspiracy could be big enough and strong enough. Such cafeteria-socialist 
conspiracies as do undoubtedly exist are groups of scared, neurotic mediocrities who find themselves 
pushed into national leadership because nobody else steps forward; they are like pickpockets who 
merely intended to snatch a welfare-regulation or two and who suddenly find that their victim is 
unconscious, that they are alone in an enormous mansion of fabulous wealth, with all the doors open 
and a seasoned burglar’s job on their hands; watch them now screaming that they didn’t mean it, that 
they had never advocated the nationalization of a country’s economy. As to the communist 
conspirators in the service of Soviet Russia, they are the best illustration of victory by default: their 
successes are handed to them by the concessions of their victims. There is no national movement for 
socialism or dictatorship in America, no “man on horseback” or popular demagogue, nothing but 
fumbling compromisers and frightened opportunists. Yet we are moving toward full, totalitarian 
socialism, with worn, cynical voices telling us that such is the irresistible trend of history. History, 
fate and malevolent conspiracy are easier to believe than the actual truth: that we are moved by 
nothing but the sluggish inertia of unfocused minds. 

Collectivism, as a social ideal, is dead, but capitalism has not yet been discovered. It cannot be 
discovered by the psycho-epistemology of Witch Doctors and Attila-ists — and as to the businessman, 
he is struggling to forget that he had ever known it. That is his guilt. 

The businessman, historically, had started as the victim of the intellectuals; but no injustice or 
exploitation can succeed for long without the sanction of the victim The businessman, who could not 
accept the intellectual leadership of post-Kantian Witch Doctors, made his fatal error when he 
conceded to them the field of the intellect. He gave them the benefit of the doubt, at his own expense: 
he concluded that their meaningless verbiage could not be as bad as it sounded to him, that he lacked 
understanding, but had no stomach for trying to understand that sort of stuff and would leave it 
respectfully alone. No Witch Doctor could have hoped for a deadlier concession. 

By becoming anti-intellectual, the businessman condemned himself to the position of an Attila. By 
restricting his goals, concerns and vision exclusively to his specific productive activity, he was 
forced to restrict his interests to Attila’s narrow range of the physical, the material, the immediately 
present. Thus he tore himself in two by an inner contradiction: he functioned on a confidently rational, 
conceptual level of psycho-epistemology in business, but repressed all the other aspects of his life 
and thought, letting himself be carried passively along by the general cultural current, in the semi- 
unfocused, perceptual-level daze of a man who considers himself impotent to judge what he 



perceives. It is thus that he turned too often into the tragic phenomenon of a genius in business who is 
a Babbitt in his private life. 

He repressed and renounced any interest in ideas, any quest for intellectual values or moral 
principles. He could not accept the altruist morality, as no man of self-esteem can accept it, and he 
found no other moral philosophy. He lived by a subjective code of his own — the code of justice, the 
code of a fair trader — without knowing what a superlative moral virtue it represented. His private 
version or understanding of altruism — particularly in America — took the form of an enormous 
generosity, the joyous, innocent, benevolent generosity of a self-confident man, who is too innocent to 
suspect that he is hated for his success, that the moralists of altruism want him to pay financial 
tributes, not as kindness, but as atonement for the guilt of having succeeded. There were exceptions; 
there were businessmen who did accept the full philosophical meaning of altruism and its ugly burden 
of guilt, but they were not the majority. 

They are the majority today. No man or group of men can live indefinitely under the pressure of 
moral injustice: they have to rebel or give in. Most of the businessmen gave in; it would have taken a 
philosopher to provide them with the intellectual weapons of rebellion, but they had given up any 
interest in philosophy. They accepted the burden of an unearned guilt; they accepted the brand of 
“vulgar materialists”; they accepted the accusations of “predatory greed” — predatory toward the 
wealth which they had created, greed for the fortunes which, but for them, would not have existed. As 
a result, consciously or subconsciously, they were driven to the cynical bitterness of the conviction 
that men are irrational, that reason is impotent in human relationships, that the field of ideas is some 
dark, gigantic, incomprehensible fraud. 

No one can accept unearned guilt with psychological impunity. Starting as the most courageous 
class of men in history, the businessmen have slipped slowly into the position of men motivated by 
chronic fear — in all the social, political, moral, intellectual aspects of their existence. Their public 
policy consists of appeasing their worst enemies, placating their most contemptible attackers, trying 
to make terms with their own destroyers, pouring money into the support of leftist publications and 
“liberal” politicians, placing avowed collectivists in charge of their public relations and then voicing 
— in banquet speeches and full-page ads — socialistic protestations that selfless service to society is 
their only goal, and altruistic apologies for the fact that they still keep two or three percent of profit 
out of their multi-million-dollar enterprises. 

There are many different motives behind that policy. Some men are moved by actual guilt: they are 
the new type of businessmen, the product of a “mixed” economy, who make fortunes, not by 
productive ability and competition in a free market, but by political pull, by government favors, 
subsidies, franchises and special privileges; these are psycho-epistemologically and economically 
closer to Attila than to the Producer, and have good reason to feel guilty. Others are forced reluctantly 
into a mixed position, where they still live by productive ability, yet have to depend on government 
favors in order to function; these are the closest to the position of self-destroyers. The majority of 
businessmen — perhaps the ablest and best — work in silence and are never heard from publicly. Most 
businessmen have probably given up the expectation of any justice from the public. But there is one 
motive which is shared by too many businessmen and which is the penalty for renouncing the 
intellect: an unconfessed fear of ideas under the professed conviction that ideas are futile, which 
leads to a nervously stubborn evasiveness, an anxious feeling or hope that wealth as such is power, 
that only material possessions are of practical importance. 



Today, the businessman and the intellectual face each other with the mutual fear and the mutual 
contempt of Attila and the Witch Doctor. The businessman has lost confidence in all theories, and 
functions on a range-of-the-moment expediency, not daring to look at the future. The intellectual has 
cut himself off from reality and plays a futile word-game with ideas, not daring to look at the past. 
The businessman considers the intellectual unpractical; the intellectual considers the businessman 
immoral. But, secretly, each of them believes that the other possesses a mysterious faculty he lacks, 
that the other is the true master of reality, the true exponent of the power to deal with existence. 

It is by this mutual attitude and the philosophical premises from which it comes that they are 
destroying each other. The major share of the guilt belongs to the intellectual: philosophical 
leadership was his responsibility, which he betrayed and is now deserting under fire. 

The most grotesquely anachronistic and atavistic spectacle in history is the spectacle of the modern 
intellectuals raising the primordial voice of the Witch Doctor and, in the midst of an industrial 
civilization, wailing about the hopeless misery of life on earth, the depravity of man, the impotence of 
man’s mind, the ignoble vulgarity of material pursuits, and the nobility of longing for the supernatural. 

The echoes answering them are the voices of the plain, medieval Witch Doctors that are beginning 
to be heard again, preaching the doctrine of man’s innate, preordained impotence, of humility, 
passivity, submission and resignation — here, in New York City, the greatest monument to the potency 
of man’s mind — and proclaiming that all the disasters of the modern age are man’s punishment for the 
pride of relying on his intellect, for his attempt to improve his condition, to establish a rational 
society and to achieve a perfect way of life on earth. 

On a recent television panel discussion, an alleged conservative intellectual was asked to define 
the difference between a “conservative” and a “liberal.” He answered that a “liberal” is one who 
does not believe in Original Sin. To which a liberal intellectual replied hastily: “Oh, yes, we do!” — 
but proceeded to add that the liberals believe they can improve man’s life just a little. 

Such is the bankruptcy of a culture. 

It is into the midst of this dismal gray vacuum that the New Intellectuals must step — and must 
challenge the worshippers of doom, resignation and death, with an attitude best expressed by a 
paraphrase of an ancient salute: “We who are not about to die . . .” 

Who are to be the New Intellectuals? Any man or woman who is willing to think. All those who 
know that man’s life must be guided by reason, those who value their own life and are not willing to 
surrender it to the cult of despair in the modern jungle of cynical impotence, just as they are not 
willing to surrender the world to the Dark Ages and the rule of the brutes. 

The need for intellectual leadership was never as great as now. No human being who has a trace of 
personal worth can be willing to surrender his life without lifting a hand — or a mind — to defend it, 
particularly not in America, the country based on the premise of man’s self-reliance and self-esteem. 
Americans have known how to erect a superlative material achievement in the midst of an untouched 
wilderness, against the resistance of savage tribes. What we need today is to erect a corresponding 
philosophical structure, without which the material greatness cannot survive. A skyscraper cannot 
stand on crackerbarrels, nor on wall mottoes, nor on full-page ads, nor on prayers, nor on meta- 
language. The new wilderness to reclaim is philosophy, now all but deserted, with the weeds of 
prehistoric doctrines rising again to swallow the ruins. To support a culture, nothing less than a new 
philosophical foundation will do. The present state of the world is not the proof of philosophy’s 
impotence, but the proof of philosophy’s power. It is philosophy that has brought men to this state — it 



is only philosophy that can lead them out. 

Those who could become the New Intellectuals are America’s hidden assets; their number is 
probably greater than anyone can estimate; they exist in every profession, even among the present 
intellectuals. But they are scattered in silent helplessness throughout the country, or hidden in that 
underground which, in human history, has too often swallowed the best of men’s potential: 
subjectivity. They are the men who have long since lost respect for the cultural standards to which 
they conform, but who hide their own convictions or repress their ideas or suppress their minds, each 
feeling that he has no chance against the others, each serving as both victim and destroyer. The New 
Intellectuals will be those men who will come out into the open and have the courage to break that 
vicious circle. 

If they glance at the state of our culture, they will see that the entire miserable show is kept up by 
nothing but routine and pretense, which disguise bewilderment and fear: nobody dares to take the first 
new step, everybody waits for his neighbor’s initiative. If a society reaches the stage where every 
man accepts the feeling that he is “a stranger and afraid in a world [he] never made,” the world it 
gives up will be made by Attila. The greatest need today is for men who are not strangers to reality, 
because they are not afraid of thought. The New Intellectuals will be those who will take the initiative 
and the responsibility: they will check their own philosophical premises, identify their convictions, 
integrate their ideas into coherence and consistency, then offer to the country a view of existence to 
which the wise and honest can repair. 

The New Intellectual will be the man who lives up to the exact meaning of his title: a man who is 
guided by his intellect — not a zombie guided by feelings, instincts, urges, wishes, whims or 
revelations. Ending the rule of Attila and the Witch Doctor, he will discard the basic premise that 
made them possible: the soul-body dichotomy. He will discard its irrational conflicts and 
contradictions, such as: mind versus heart, thought versus action, reality versus desire, the practical 
versus the moral. He will be an integrated man, that is: a thinker who is a man of action. He will 
know that ideas divorced from consequent action are fraudulent, and that action divorced from ideas 
is suicidal. He will know that the conceptual level of psycho-epistemology — the volitional level of 
reason and thought — is the basic necessity of man’s survival and his greatest moral virtue. He will 
know that men need philosophy for the purpose of living on earth. 

The New Intellectual will be a reunion of the twins who should never have been separated: the 
intellectual and the businessman. He can come from among the best — that is: the most rational — men 
who may still exist in both camps. In place of an involuntary Witch Doctor and a reluctant Attila, the 
reunion will produce two new types: the practical thinker and the philosophical businessman. 

The best among the present intellectuals should consider the tremendous power which they are 
holding, but have never fully exercised or understood. If any man among them feels that he is the 
helpless, ineffectual step-son of a “materialistic” culture that grants him neither wealth nor 
recognition, let him remember the meaning of his title: his power is his intellect, not his feelings, 
emotions or intuitions. It is not the businessmen who have robbed him of efficacy, but those of his 
colleagues who have degraded his profession to the level of soothsayers, tea-leaf readers and jungle 
oracles. Let him break with the neo-mystics; let him realize that ideas are not an escape from reality, 
not a hobby for “disinterested” neurotics in ivory towers, but the most crucial and practical power in 
human existence. Then let him become an intellectual leader who assumes full responsibility for the 
practical consequences of his theories. 



The best among the businessmen should consider the function of wealth, and realize that the power 
behind the incomprehensible evil now unleashed against them is their own. Wealth, as such, is only a 
tool; by renouncing his intellect, the businessman has placed his wealth in the service of his own 
destroyers. They do not need to nationalize his property: they nationalized his mind long ago. Let him 
now realize that practical action without a theoretical base achieves the opposite of his goals, and 
that intellectual irresponsibility is not a way of escape from his enemies. Then let him discover the 
function of philosophy. 

Instead of those ludicrous programs of “student exchanges” between America and Soviet Russia, 
for the alleged purpose of “gaining mutual understanding,” there ought to be a private, voluntary 
program of “student exchanges” between the intellectuals and the businessmen, the two groups that 
need each other most, yet know less and understand less about each other than about any alien society 
in any distant corner of the globe. The businessmen need to discover the intellect; the intellectuals 
need to discover reality. Let the intellectuals understand the nature and the function of a free market in 
order to offer the businessmen, as well as the public at large, the guidance of an intelligible 
theoretical framework for dealing with men, with society, with politics, with economics. Let the 
businessmen learn the basic issues and principles of philosophy in order to know how to judge ideas, 
then let them assume full responsibility for the kind of ideologies they choose to finance and support. 

Let them both discover the nature, the theory and the actual history of capitalism; both groups are 
equally ignorant of it. No other subject is hidden by so many distortions, misconceptions, 
misrepresentations and falsifications. Let them study the historical facts and discover that all the evils 
popularly ascribed to capitalism were caused, necessitated and made possible only by government 
controls imposed on the economy. Whenever they hear capitalism being denounced, let them check the 
facts and discover which of the two opposite political principles — free trade or government controls 
— was responsible for the alleged iniquities. When they hear it said that capitalism has had its chance 
and has failed, let them remember that what ultimately failed was a “mixed” economy, that the 
controls were the cause of the failure, and that the way to save a country is not by making it swallow 
a full, “unmixed” glass of the poison which is killing it. 

The Founding Fathers were America’s first intellectuals and, so far, her last. It is their basic 
political line that the New Intellectuals have to continue. Today, that line is lost under layer upon 
layer of evasions, equivocations and plain falsehood; today’s Witch Doctors claim that the basic 
premise of the Founding Fathers was faith and uncritical compliance with tradition; today’s Attila-ists 
claim that that basic premise was the subordination of the individual to the collective and his 
sacrifice to the public good. The New Intellectuals must remind the world that the basic premise of 
the Founding Fathers was man’s right to his own life, to his own liberty, to the pursuit of his own 
happiness — which means: man’s right to exist for his own sake, neither sacrificing himself to others 
nor sacrificing others to himself; and that the political implementation of this right is a society where 
men deal with one another as traders, by voluntary exchange to mutual benefit. 

The moral premises implicit in the political philosophy of the Founding Fathers, in the social 
system they established and in the economics of capitalism, must now be recognized and accepted in 
the form of an explicit moral philosophy. That which is merely implicit is not in men’s conscious 
control; they can lose it by means of other implications, without knowing what it is that they are losing 
or when or why. It was the morality of altruism that undercut America and is now destroying her. 
From her start, America was torn by the clash of her political system with the altruist morality. 



Capitalism and altruism are incompatible; they are philosophical opposites; they cannot co-exist in 
the same man or in the same society. Today, the conflict has reached its ultimate climax; the choice is 
clear-cut: either a new morality of rational self-interest, with its consequences of freedom, justice, 
progress and man’s happiness on earth — or the primordial morality of altruism, with its consequences 
of slavery, brute force, stagnant terror and sacrificial furnaces. 

The world crisis of today is a moral crisis — and nothing less than a moral revolution can resolve 
it: a moral revolution to sanction and complete the political achievement of the American Revolution. 
Evasions, equivocations and guilty apologies will not work any longer. The disgraceful injustice 
which penalized virtue for being virtue, which forced businessmen to apologize for their ability, for 
their success, for their achievements, has now been projected onto a global scale and translated into 
the disgraceful spectacle of America apologizing for her virtues and greatness to that bloody 
slaughterhouse of embodied altruism which is Soviet Russia. 

The New Intellectuals must fight for capitalism, not as a “practical” issue, not as an economic 
issue, but, with the most righteous pride, as a moral issue. That is what capitalism deserves, and 
nothing less will save it. 

The New Intellectuals must assume the task of building a new culture on a new moral foundation, 
which, for once, will not be the culture of Attila and the Witch Doctor, but the culture of the Producer. 
They will have to be radicals in the literal and reputable sense of the word: “radical” means 
“fundamental.” The representatives of intellectual orthodoxy, conventionality and status quo, the 
Babbitts of today, are the collectivists. Let those who do care about the future, those willing to 
crusade for a perfect society, realize that the new radicals are the fighters for capitalism 

It is not an easy task and it cannot be achieved overnight. But the New Intellectuals have an 
inestimable advantage: they have reality on their side. The difficulties they will encounter on their 
way are not stone barriers, but fog: the heavy fog of passive disintegration, through which it will be 
hard for them to find one another. They will encounter no opposition, since, in this context, an 
opposition would have to possess intellectual weapons. As to their enemies, they should comply 
with their enemies ’ request — and leave them to heaven. 

The process of identifying, judging, accepting and upholding a new philosophy of life is a long, 
complicated process, which requires thought, proof, full understanding and conviction. But there are 
two principles on which all men of intellectual integrity and good will can agree, as a “basic 
minimum,” as a precondition of any discussion, co-operation or movement toward an intellectual 
Renaissance. One principle is epistemological, the other is moral; they are not axioms, but until a man 
has proved them to himself and has accepted them, he is not fit for an intellectual discussion. These 
two principles are: a. that emotions are not tools of cognition; b. that no man has the right to initiate 
the use of physical force against others. 

a. The first of these two principles represents one’s basic rejection of the Witch Doctor’s 
psycho-epistemology. It means that one must differentiate between one’s thoughts and one’s 
emotions with full clarity and precision. One does not have to be omniscient in order to possess 
knowledge; one merely has to know that which one does know, and distinguish it from that which 
one feels. Nor does one need a full system of philosophical epistemology in order to distinguish 
one’s own considered judgment from one’s feelings, wishes, hopes or fears. Those who claim 
that they cannot do it are merely confessing that they have never learned how to use their mind 
and are incapable of perceiving, judging or evaluating reality. This may be a psychological 



problem, but it becomes an intellectual fraud when such persons enter a philosophical 
discussion and demand consideration for their ideas. No discussion, co-operation, agreement or 
understanding is possible among men who substitute emotion for proof. 

b. This second principle represents one’s basic rejection of Attila’s psycho-epistemology. To 
claim the right to initiate the use of physical force against another man — the right to compel his 
agreement by the threat of physical destruction — is to evict oneself automatically from the realm 
of rights, of morality and of the intellect. Perhaps the most obscene legacy of altruism among 
modern intellectuals is their axiomatic acceptance of brute force and of somebody’s sacrifice as 
a normal and necessary part of a human society, and their refusal to consider the possibility of a 
non-sacrificial, non-compulsory co-existence and co-operation among men. Observe that they 
cannot conceive of “selfishness” except in terms of sacrificing others to oneself, and they cannot 
conceive of anyone who does not regard such sacrificing as to his own interest. This, of course, 
is a psychological confession about the nature of their own desires and about the Attila in their 
souls. When they declare that they see no difference between economic power and political 
power — which means: no difference between an employer and a holdup man, no difference 
between the United States and Soviet Russia — they are confessing a Witch Doctor’s abject fear 
of reality, which makes them equate a Producer with an Attila. 

One would suppose that any man who makes claim to the title of moralist, humanitarian or 
intellectual would spend his life trying to devise — as an ideal — a social system where no man or 
group of men may initiate the use of physical force against others or demand the sacrifice of anyone to 
anyone. But when one remembers that such a system was devised and did exist less than a hundred 
years ago, one knows how to evaluate the brutes and thugs of the spirit who refuse to consider it 
possible.- 

So long as men believe that the initiation of physical force by some men against others is a proper 
part of an organized society — hatred, violence, brutality, destruction, slaughter and the savage gang 
warfare of group against group are all they can or will achieve. When physical force is the ultimate 
arbiter, men are driven to connive, conspire and gang up on one another in order to destroy rather than 
be destroyed; the best perish, but the Attilas rise to the top. It might be understandable that primitive, 
savage tribes could not conceive of a way of life without resort to physical violence — and the bloody 
chaos of tribal warfare was all they achieved, as those who remained on that level still demonstrate 
today. But when men propose to live in an industrial civilization by the moral concepts of those jungle 
savages, with nuclear missiles and H-bombs at their disposal — they deserve the catastrophes they ask 
for. Let no man posture as an advocate of peace if he proposes or supports any social system that 
initiates the use of physical force against individual men, in any form whatever. Let no man posture as 
an advocate of freedom if he claims the right to establish his version of a good society where 
individual dissenters are to be suppressed by means of physical force. Let no man posture as an 
intellectual if he proposes to elevate a thug into the position of final authority over the intellect — or if 
he equates the power of physical compulsion with the power of persuasion — or if he equates the 
power of muscles with the power of ideas. 

No advocate of reason can claim the right to force his ideas on others. No advocate of the free 
mind can claim the right to force the minds of others. No rational society, no co-operation, no 
agreement, no understanding, no discussion are possible among men who propose to substitute guns 
for rational persuasion. 


If men of good will wish to come together for the purpose of upholding reason and establishing a 
rational society, they should begin by following the example of the cowboys in Western movies when 
the sheriff tells them at the door to a conference room: “Gentlemen, leave your guns outside.” 

Those who will accept the “basic minimum” of civilization, the two principles stated above, will 
have made the first step toward the building of a new culture in the wide-open spaces of today’s 
intellectual vacuum. There is an ancient slogan that applies to our present position: “The king is dead 
— long live the king!” We can say, with the same dedication to the future: “The intellectuals are dead 
— long live the intellectuals!” — and then proceed to fulfill the responsibility which that honorable 
title had once implied. 



We the Living 


(3 7 e 


This novel was published in 1936 and reissued in 1959. Its theme is: the individual against the 
state; the supreme value of a human life and the evil of the totalitarian state that claims the right 
to sacrifice it. The story takes place in Soviet Russia. The excerpt below is the speech of Kira 
Argounova to Andrei Taganov, in the following context: Kira has been having a love affair with 
Andrei in order to obtain money to save the life of Leo Kovalensky, the man she loves; Andrei, an 
idealistic young Communist, who is profoundly in love with her, was beginning to discover the 
importance of personal values, when, in the course of arresting Leo for a political crime, he learns 
the truth about Kira s relationship to both of them. 

“No, you didn’t know. But it was very simple. And not very unusual. Go through the garrets and 
basements where men live in your Red cities and see how many cases like this you can find. He 
wanted to live. You think everything that breathes can live? You’ve learned differently, I know. But he 
was one who could have lived. There aren’t many of them, so they don’t count with you. The doctor 
said he was going to die. And I loved him. You’ve learned what that means, too, haven’t you? He 
didn’t need much. Only rest, and fresh air, and food. He had no right to that, had he? Your State said 
so. We tried to beg. We begged humbly. Do you know what they said? There was a doctor in a 
hospital and he said he had hundreds on his waiting list. . . . 

“You see, you must understand this thoroughly. No one does. No one sees it, but I do, I can’t help it, 
I see it, you must see it, too. You understand? Hundreds. Thousands. Millions. Millions of what? 
Stomachs, and heads, and legs, and tongues, and souls. And it doesn’t even matter whether they fit 
together. Just millions. Just flesh. Human flesh. And they — it — had been registered and numbered, you 
know, like tin cans on a store shelf. I wonder if they’re registered by the person or by the pound? And 
they had a chance to go on living. But not Leo. He was only a man. All stones are cobblestones to 
you. And diamonds — they’re useless, because they sparkle too brightly in the sun, and it’s too hard on 
the eyes, and it’s too hard under the hoofs marching into the proletarian future. You don’t pave roads 
with diamonds. They may have other uses in the world, but of those you’ve never learned. That is 
why you had sentenced him to death, and others like him, an execution without a firing squad. There 
was a big commissar and I went to see him. He told me that a hundred thousand workers had died in 
the civil war and why couldn’t one aristocrat die — in the face of the Union of Socialist Soviet 
Republics? And what is the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics in the face of one man? But that is a 
question not for you to answer. I’m grateful to that commissar. He gave me permission to do what I’ve 
done. I don’t hate him You should hate him What I’m doing to you — he did it first! . . . 

“That’s the question, you know, don’t you? Why can’t one aristocrat die in the face of the Union of 
Socialist Soviet Republics? You don’t understand that, do you? You and your great commissar, and a 
million others, like you, like him, that’s what you brought to the world, that question and your answer 
to it! A great gift, isn’t it? But one of you has been paid. I paid it. In you and to you. For all the sorrow 



your comrades brought to a living world. How do you like it, Comrade Andrei Taganov of the All- 
Union Communist Party? If you taught us that our life is nothing before that of the State — well then, 
are you really suffering? If I brought you to the last hell of despair — well then, why don’t you say that 
one’s own life doesn’t really matter? . . . You loved a woman and she threw your love in your face? 
But the proletarian mines in the Don Basin have produced a hundred tons of coal last month! You had 
two altars and you saw suddenly that a harlot stood on one of them, and Citizen Morozov on the 
other? But the Proletarian State has exported ten thousand bushels of wheat last month! You’ve had 
every beam knocked from under your life? But the Proletarian Republic is building a new electric 
plant on the \blga! Why don’t you smile and sing hymns to the toil of the Collective? It’s still there, 
your Collective. Go and join it. Did anything really happen to you? It’s nothing but a personal 
problem of a private life, the kind that only the dead old world could worry about, isn’t it? Don’t you 
have something greater — greater is the word your comrades use — left to live for? Or do you. 
Comrade Taganov? . . . 

“Now look at me! Take a good look! I was born and I knew I was alive and I knew what I wanted. 
Wfrat do you think is alive in me? Why do you think I’m alive? Because I have a stomach and eat and 
digest the food? Because I breathe and work and produce more food to digest? Or because I know 
what I want, and that something which knows how to want — isn’t that life itself? And who — in this 
damned universe — who can tell me why I should live for anything but for that which I want? Who can 
answer that in human sounds that speak for human reason? . . . But you’ve tried to tell us what we 
should want. You came as a solemn army to bring a new life to men. You tore that life you knew 
nothing about, out of their guts — and you told them what it had to be. You took their every hour, every 
minute, every nerve, every thought in the farthest corners of their souls — and you told them what it 
had to be. You came and you forbade life to the living. You’ve driven us all into an iron cellar and 
you’ve closed all doors, and you’ve locked us airtight, airtight till the blood vessels of our spirits 
burst! Then you stare and wonder what it’s doing to us. Well, then, look! All of you who have eyes 
left — look!”

This novelette was first published in England in 1938. Its theme is: the meaning of man s ego. It 
projects a society of the future, which has accepted total collectivism with all of its ultimate 
consequences: men have relapsed into primitive savagery and stagnation; the word “I” has 
vanished from the human language, there are no singular pronouns, a man refers to himself as 
“we” and to another man as “they. ” The story presents the gradual rediscovery of the word “I” by 
a man of intransigent mind. The following excerpt is from his statement about his discovery. 

“I am. I think. I will. . . . 

“What must I say besides? These are the words. This is the answer. 

“I stand here on the summit of the mountain. I lift my head and I spread my arms. This — my body 
and spirit — this is the end of the quest. I wished to know the meaning of things. I am the meaning. I 
wished to find a warrant for being. I need no warrant for being, and no word of sanction upon my 
being. I am the warrant and the sanction. . . . 

“I know not if this earth on which I stand is the core of the universe or if it is but a speck of dust 
lost in eternity. I know not and I care not. For I know what happiness is possible to me on earth. And 
my happiness needs no higher aim to vindicate it. My happiness is not the means to any end. It is the 
end. It is its own goal. It is its own purpose. 

“Neither am I the means to any end others may wish to accomplish. I am not a tool for their use. I 
am not a servant of their needs. I am not a bandage for their wounds. I am not a sacrifice on their 
altars. . . . 

“I owe nothing to my brothers, nor do I gather debts from them I ask none to live for me, nor do I 
live for any others. I covet no man’s soul, nor is my soul theirs to covet. 

“I am neither foe nor friend to my brothers, but such as each of them shall deserve of me. And to 
earn my love, my brothers must do more than to have been born. I do not grant my love without 
reason, nor to any chance passer-by who may wish to claim it. I honor men with my love. But honor is 
a thing to be earned. 

“I shall choose friends among men, but neither slaves nor masters. And I shall choose only such as 
please me, and them I shall love and respect, but neither command nor obey. And we shall join our 
hands when we wish, or walk alone when we so desire. For in the temple of his spirit, each man is 
alone. Let each man keep his temple untouched and undefiled. Then let him join hands with others if 
he wishes, but only beyond his holy threshold. 

“For the word ‘We’ must never be spoken, save by one’s choice and as a second thought. This 
word must never be placed first within man’s soul, else it becomes a monster, the root of all the evils 
on earth, the root of man’s torture by men, and of an unspeakable lie. 

“The word ‘We’ is as lime poured over men, which sets and hardens to stone, and crushes all 
beneath it, and that which is white and that which is black are lost equally in the gray of it. It is the 



word by which the depraved steal the virtue of the good, by which the weak steal the might of the 
strong, by which the fools steal the wisdom of the sages. 

“What is my joy if all hands, even the unclean, can reach into it? What is my wisdom, if even the 
fools can dictate to me? What is my freedom, if all creatures, even the botched and the impotent, are 
my masters? What is my life, if I am but to bow, to agree and to obey? 

“But I am done with this creed of corruption. 

“I am done with the monster of ‘We,’ the word of serfdom, of plunder, of misery, falsehood and 
shame. 

“And now I see the face of god, and I raise this god over the earth, this god whom men have sought 
since men came into being, this god who will grant them joy and peace and pride. 

“This god, this one word: I.” 



The Fountainhead 


&lt; 2 &gt;= 


This novel was published in 1943. Its theme is: individualism versus collectivism, not in politics, 
but in man s soul; the psychological motivations and the basic premises that produce the character 
of an individualist or a collectivist. The story presents the career of Howard Roark, an architect 
and innovator, who breaks with tradition, recognizes no authority but that of his own independent 
judgment, struggles for the integrity of his creative work against every form of social opposition — 
and wins. 


THE NATURE OF THE SECOND-HANDER 


This excerpt is from a conversation between Roark and his friend Gail Wynand, in which Roark 
explains what he has discovered about the psychology of those whose basic motivation is the 
opposite of his own. 

“It’s what I couldn’t understand about people for a long time. They have no self. They live within 
others. They live second-hand. Look at Peter Keating. ... I’ve looked at him — at what’s left of him — 
and it’s helped me to understand. He’s paying the price and wondering for what sin and telling 
himself that he’s been too selfish. In what act or thought of his has there ever been a self? What was 
his aim in life? Greatness — in other people’s eyes. Fame, admiration, envy — all that which comes 
from others. Others dictated his convictions, which he did not hold, but he was satisfied that others 
believed he held them. Others were his motive power and his prime concern. He didn’t want to be 
great, but to be thought great. He didn’t want to build, but to be admired as a builder. He borrowed 
from others in order to make an impression on others. There’s your actual selflessness. It’s his ego 
that he’s betrayed and given up. But everybody calls him selfish. . . . 

“Isn’t that the root of every despicable action? Not selfishness, but precisely the absence of a self. 
Look at them. The man who cheats and lies, but preserves a respectable front. He knows himself to be 
dishonest, but others think he’s honest and he derives his self-respect from that, second-hand. The man 
who takes credit for an achievement which is not his own. He knows himself to be mediocre, but he’s 
great in the eyes of others. The frustrated wretch who professes love for the inferior and clings to 
those less endowed, in order to establish his own superiority by comparison. . . . They’re second- 
handers. . . . 

“They have no concern for facts, ideas, work. They’re concerned only with people. They don’t ask: 
‘Is this true?’ They ask: ‘Is this what others think is true?’ Not to judge, but to repeat. Not to do, but to 
give the impression of doing. Not creation, but show. Not ability, but friendship. Not merit, but pull. 
Wfrat would happen to the world without those who do, think, work, produce? Those are the egoists. 



You don’t think through another’s brain and you don’t work through another’s hands. When you 
suspend your faculty of independent judgment, you suspend consciousness. To stop consciousness is 
to stop life. Second-handers have no sense of reality. Their reality is not within them, but somewhere 
in that space which divides one human body from another. Not an entity, but a relation — anchored to 
nothing. That’s the emptiness I couldn’t understand in people. That’s what stopped me whenever I 
faced a committee. Men without an ego. Opinion without a rational process. Motion without brakes or 
motor. Power without responsibility. The second-hander acts, but the source of his actions is 
scattered in every other living person. It’s everywhere and nowhere and you can’t reason with him. 
He’s not open to reason. You can’t speak to him — he can’t hear. You’re tried by an empty bench. A 
blind mass running amuck, to crush you without sense or purpose. . . .” 

“Notice how they’ll accept anything except a man who stands alone. They recognize him at once. . . 
. There’s a special, insidious kind of hatred for him. They forgive criminals. They admire dictators. 
Crime and violence are a tie. A form of mutual dependence. They need ties. They’ve got to force their 
miserable little personalities on every single person they meet. The independent man kills them — 
because they don’t exist within him and that’s the only form of existence they know. Notice the 
malignant kind of resentment against any idea that pro-pounds independence. Notice the malice 
toward an independent man. . . .” 

“After centuries of being pounded with the doctrine that altruism is the ultimate ideal, men have 
accepted it in the only way it could be accepted. By seeking self-esteem through others. By living 
second-hand. And it has opened the way for every kind of horror. It has become the dreadful form of 
selfishness which a truly selfish man couldn’t have conceived. And now, to cure a world perishing 
from selflessness, we’re asked to destroy the self. Listen to what is being preached today. Look at 
everyone around us. You’ve wondered why they suffer, why they seek happiness and never find it. If 
any man stopped and asked himself whether he’s ever held a truly personal desire, he’d find the 
answer. He’d see that all his wishes, his efforts, his dreams, his ambitions are motivated by other 
men. He’s not really struggling even for material wealth, but for the second-hander’s delusion — 
prestige. A stamp of approval, not his own. He can find no joy in the struggle and no joy when he has 
succeeded. He can’t say about a single thing: ‘This is what I wanted because / wanted it not because 
it made my neighbors gape at me.’ Then he wonders why he’s unhappy. Every form of happiness is 
private. Our greatest moments are personal, self-motivated, not to be touched. The things which are 
sacred or precious to us are the things we withdraw from promiscuous sharing. But now we are taught 
to throw everything within us into public light and common pawing. To seek joy in meeting halls. We 
haven’t even got a word for the quality I mean — for the self-sufficiency of man’s spirit. It’s difficult to 
call it selfishness or egoism, the words have been perverted, they’ve come to mean Peter Keating. 
Gail, I think the only cardinal evil on earth is that of placing your prime concern within other men. 
I’ve always demanded a certain quality in the people I liked. I’ve always recognized it at once — and 
it’s the only quality I respect in men. I chose my friends by that. Now I know what it is. A self- 
sufficient ego. Nothing else matters.” 


THE SOUL OF A COLLECTIVIST 



This excerpt is the confession of Roark’s antipode and archenemy, Ellsworth M. Toohey, an 
architectural critic and sociologist, who spends his life plotting the future establishment of a 
collectivist society. He is addressing one of his own victims. 

“I’ve always said just that. Clearly, precisely and openly It’s not my fault if you couldn’t hear. You 
could, of course. You didn’t want to. Which was safer than deafness — for me. I said I intended to 
rule. Like all my spiritual predecessors. But I’m luckier than they were. I inherited the fruit of their 
efforts and I shall be the one who’ll see the great dream made real. I see it all around me today. I 
recognize it. I don’t like it. I didn’t expect to like it. Enjoyment is not my destiny. I shall find such 
satisfaction as my capacity permits. I shall rule. . . . 

“It’s only a matter of discovering the lever. If you learn how to rule one single man’s soul, you can 
get the rest of mankind. It’s the soul, Peter, the soul. Not whips or swords or fire or guns. That’s why 
the Caesars, the Attilas, the Napoleons were fools and did not last. We will. The soul, Peter, is that 
which can’t be ruled. It must be broken. Drive a wedge in, get your fingers on it — and the man is 
yours. You won’t need a whip — he’ll bring it to you and ask to be whipped. Set him in reverse — and 
his own mechanism will do your work for you. Use him against himself. Want to know how it’s done? 
See if I ever lied to you. See if you haven’t heard all this for years, but didn’t want to hear, and the 
fault is yours, not mine. There are many ways. Here’s one. Make man feel small. Make him feel guilty. 
Kill his aspiration and his integrity. That’s difficult. The worst among you gropes for an ideal in his 
own twisted way. Kill integrity by internal corruption. Use it against itself. Direct it toward a goal 
destructive of all integrity. Preach selflessness. Tell man that he must live for others. Tell men that 
altruism is the ideal. Not a single one of them has ever achieved it and not a single one ever will. His 
every living instinct screams against it. But don’t you see what you accomplish? Man realizes that 
he’s incapable of what he’s accepted as the noblest virtue — and it gives him a sense of guilt, of sin, of 
his own basic unworthiness. Since the supreme ideal is beyond his grasp he gives up eventually all 
ideals, all aspiration, all sense of his personal value. He feels himself obliged to preach what he 
can’t practice. But one can’t be good halfway or honest approximately. To preserve one’s integrity is 
a hard battle. Why preserve that which one knows to be corrupt already? His soul gives up its self- 
respect. You’ve got him. He’ll obey. He’ll be glad to obey — because he can’t trust himself, he feels 
uncertain, he feels unclean. That’s one way. Here’s another. Kill man’s sense of values. Kill his 
capacity to recognize greatness or to achieve it. Great men can’t be ruled. We don’t want any great 
men. Don’t deny the conception of greatness. Destroy it from within. The great is the rare, the 
difficult, the exceptional. Set up standards of achievement open to all, to the least, to the most inept — 
and you stop the impetus to effort in all men, great or small. You stop all incentive to improvement, to 
excellence, to perfection. . . . Don’t set out to raze all shrines — you’ll frighten men. Enshrine 
mediocrity — and the shrines are razed. Then there’s another way. Kill by laughter. Laughter is an 
instrument of human joy. Learn to use it as a weapon of destruction. Turn it into a sneer. It’s simple. 
Tell them to laugh at everything. Tell them that a sense of humor is an unlimited virtue. Don’t let 
anything remain sacred in a man’s soul — and his soul won’t be sacred to him. Kill reverence and 
you’ve killed the hero in man. One doesn’t reverence with a giggle. He’ll obey and he’ll set no limits 
to his obedience — anything goes — nothing is too serious. Here’s another way. This is most important. 
Don’t allow men to be happy. Happiness is self-contained and self-sufficient. Happy men have no 
time and no use for you. Happy men are free men. So kill their joy in living. Take away from them 



whatever is dear or important to them. Never let them have what they want. Make them feel that the 
mere fact of a personal desire is evil. Bring them to a state where saying 7 want’ is no longer a 
natural right, but a shameful admission. Altruism is of great help in this. Unhappy men will come to 
you. They’ll need you. They’ll come for consolation, for support, for escape. Nature allows no 
vacuum. Empty man’s soul — and the space is yours to fill. I don’t see why you should look so 
shocked, Peter. This is the oldest one of all. Look back at history. Look at any great system of ethics, 
from the Orient up. Didn’t they all preach the sacrifice of personal joy? Under all the complications 
of verbiage, haven’t they all had a single leitmotif: sacrifice, renunciation, self-denial? Haven’t you 
been able to catch their theme song — ‘Give up, give up, give up, give up’? Look at the moral 
atmosphere of today. Everything enjoyable, from cigarettes to sex to ambition to the profit motive, is 
considered depraved or sinful. Just prove that a thing makes men happy — and you’ve damned it. 
That’s how far we’ve come. We’ve tied happiness to guilt. And we’ve got mankind by the throat. 
Throw your first-born into a sacrificial furnace — lie on a bed of nails — go into the desert to mortify 
the flesh — don’t dance — don’t go to the movies on Sunday — don’t try to get rich — don’t smoke — 
don’t drink. It’s all the same line. The great line. Pools think that taboos of this nature are just 
nonsense. Something left over, old-fashioned. But there’s always a purpose in nonsense. Don’t bother 
to examine a folly — ask yourself only what it accomplishes. Every system of ethics that preached 
sacrifice grew into a world power and ruled millions of men. Of course, you must dress it up. You 
must tell people that they’ll achieve a superior kind of happiness by giving up everything that makes 
them happy. You don’t have to be too clear about it. Use big vague words. ‘Universal 
Harmony’ — ‘Eternal Spirit’ — ‘Divine Purpose’ — ‘Nirvana’ — ‘Paradise’ — ‘Racial 

Supremacy’ — ‘The Dictatorship of the Proletariat.’ Internal corruption, Peter. That’s the oldest one of 
all. The farce has been going on for centuries and men still fall for it. Yet the test should be so simple: 
just listen to any prophet and if you hear him speak of sacrifice — run. Run faster than from a plague. It 
stands to reason that where there’s sacrifice, there’s someone collecting sacrificial offerings. Where 
there’s service, there’s someone being served. The man who speaks to you of sacrifice, speaks of 
slaves and masters. And intends to be the master. But if ever you hear a man telling you that you must 
be happy, that it’s your natural right, that your first duty is to yourself — that will be the man who’s not 
after your soul. That will be the man who has nothing to gain from you. But let him come and you’ll 
scream your empty heads off, howling that he’s a selfish monster. So the racket is safe for many, many 
centuries. But here you might have noticed something. I said, ‘It stands to reason.’ Do you see? Men 
have a weapon against you. Reason. So you must be very sure to take it away from them. Cut the 
props from under it. But be careful. Don’t deny outright. Never deny anything outright, you give your 
hand away. Don’t say reason is evil — though some have gone that far and with astonishing success. 
Just say that reason is limited. That there’s something above it. What? You don’t have to be too clear 
about it either. The field’s inexhaustible. ‘Instinct’ — ‘Feeling’ — ‘Revelation’ — ‘Divine 
Intuition’ — ‘Dialectical Materialism.’ If you get caught at some crucial point and somebody tells you 
that your doctrine doesn’t make sense — you’re ready for him. You tell him that there’s something 
above sense. That here he must not try to think, he must feel. He must believe. Suspend reason and you 
play it deuces wild. Anything goes in any manner you wish whenever you need it. You’ve got him. 
Can you rule a thinking man? We don’t want any thinking men. . . . 

“Peter, you’ve heard all this. You’ve seen me practicing it for ten years. You see it being practiced 
all over the world. Why are you disgusted? You have no right to sit there and stare at me with the 



virtuous superiority of being shocked. You’re in on it. You’ve taken your share and you’ve got to go 
along. You’re afraid to see where it’s leading. I’m not. I’ll tell you. The world of the future. The 
world I want. A world of obedience and unity. A world where the thought of each man will not be his 
own, but an attempt to guess the thought in the brain of his neighbor who’ll have no thought of his own 
but an attempt to guess the thought of the next neighbor who’ll have no thought — and so on, Peter, 
around the globe. Since all must agree with all. A world where no man will hold a desire for himself, 
but will direct all his efforts to satisfy the desires of his neighbor who’ll have no desires except to 
satisfy the desires of the next neighbor who’ll have no desires — around the globe, Peter. Since all 
must serve all. A world in which man will not work for so innocent an incentive as money, but for that 
headless monster — prestige. The approval of his fellows — their good opinion — the opinion of men 
who’ll be allowed to hold no opinion. An octopus, all tentacles and no brain. Judgment, Peter? Not 
judgment, but public polls. An average drawn upon zeros — since no individuality will be permitted. 
A world with its motor cut off and a single heart, pumped by hand. My hand — and the hands of a few, 
a very few other men like me. Those who know what makes you tick — you great, wonderful average, 
you who have not risen in fury when we called you the average, the little, the common, you who’ve 
liked and accepted those names. You’ll sit enthroned and enshrined, you, the little people, the 
absolute ruler to make all past rulers squirm with envy, the absolute, the unlimited, God and Prophet 
and King combined. Vox populi. The average, the common, the general. Do you know the proper 
antonym for Ego? Bromide, Peter. The rule of the bromide. But even the trite has to be originated by 
someone at some time. We’ll do the originating. Vox dei. We’ll enjoy unlimited submission — from 
men who’ve learned nothing except to submit. We’ll call it ‘to serve.’ We’ll give out medals for 
service. You’ll fall over one another in a scramble to see who can submit better and more. There will 
be no other distinction to seek. No other form of personal achievement. Can you see Howard Roark in 
the picture? No? Then don’t waste time on foolish questions. Everything that can’t be ruled, must go. 
And if freaks persist in being born occasionally, they will not survive beyond their twelfth year. When 
their brain begins to function, it will feel the pressure and it will explode. The pressure gauged to a 
vacuum. Do you know the fate of deep-sea creatures brought out to sunlight? So much for future 
Roarks. The rest of you will smile and obey. Have you noticed that the imbecile always smiles? 
Man’s first frown is the first touch of God on his forehead. The touch of thought. But we’ll have 
neither God nor thought. Only voting by smiles. Automatic levers — all saying yes . . . Now if you 
were a little more intelligent — like your ex-wife, for instance — you’d ask: What of us, the rulers? 
What of me, Ellsworth Monkton Toohey? And I’d say, Yes, you’re right. I’ll achieve no more than you 
will. I’ll have no purpose save to keep you contented. To lie, to flatter you, to praise you, to inflate 
your vanity. To make speeches about the people and the common good. Peter, my poor old friend, I’m 
the most selfless man you’ve ever known. I have less independence than you, whom I just forced to 
sell your soul. You’ve used people at least for the sake of what you could get from them for yourself. I 
want nothing for myself. I use people for the sake of what I can do to them It’s my only function and 
satisfaction. I have no private purpose. I want power. I want my world of the future. Let all live for 
all. Let all sacrifice and none profit. Let all suffer and none enjoy. Let progress stop. Let all stagnate. 
There’s equality in stagnation. All subjugated to the will of all. Universal slavery — without even the 
dignity of a master. Slavery to slavery. A great circle — and a total equality. The world of the future. . . 


“Look around you. Pick up any newspaper and read the headlines. Isn’t it coming? Isn’t it here? 



Every single thing I told you? Isn’t Europe swallowed already and we’re stumbling on to follow? 
Everything I said is contained in a single word — collectivism. And isn’t that the god of our century? 
To act together. To think — together. To feel — together. To unite, to agree, to obey. To obey, to serve, to 
sacrifice. Divide and conquer — first. But then — unite and rule. We’ve discovered that one at last. 
Remember the Roman Emperor who said he wished humanity had a single neck so he could cut it? 
People have laughed at him for centuries. But we’ll have the last laugh. We’ve accomplished what he 
couldn’t accomplish. We’ve taught men to unite. This makes one neck ready for one leash. We’ve 
found the magic word. Collectivism Look at Europe, you fool. Can’t you see past the guff and 
recognize the essence? One country is dedicated to the proposition that man has no rights, that the 
collective is all. The individual held as evil, the mass — as God. No motive and no virtue permitted — 
except that of service to the proletariat. That’s one version. Here’s another. A country dedicated to the 
proposition that man has no rights, that the State is all. The individual held as evil, the race — as God. 
No motive and no virtue permitted — except that of service to the race. Am I raving or is this the cold 
reality of two continents already? Watch the pincer movement. If you’re sick of one version, we push 
you into the other. We get you coming and going. We’ve closed the doors. We’ve fixed the coin. Heads 
— collectivism, and tails — collectivism. Fight the doctrine which slaughters the individual with a 
doctrine which slaughters the individual. Give up your soul to a council — or give it up to a leader. 
But give it up, give it up, give it up. My technique, Peter. Offer poison as food and poison as antidote. 
Go fancy on the trimmings, but hang on to the main objective. Give the fools a choice, let them have 
their fun — but don’t forget the only purpose you have to accomplish. Kill the individual. Kill man’s 
soul. The rest will follow automatically.” 


THE SOUL OF AN INDIVIDUALIST 


This is the speech that Howard Roark makes in his own defense, while on trial for having 
dynamited a government housing project under construction; he had designed the project for 
another architect, Peter Keating, on the agreement that it would be built exactly as he designed it; 
the agreement was broken by the government agency; the two architects had no recourse to law, 
not being permitted to sue the government. 

“Thousands of years ago, the first man discovered how to make fire. He was probably burned at 
the stake he had taught his brothers to light. He was considered an evildoer who had dealt with a 
demon mankind dreaded. But thereafter men had fire to keep them warm, to cook their food, to light 
their caves. He had left them a gift they had not conceived and he had lifted darkness off the earth. 
Centuries later, the first man invented the wheel. He was probably torn on the rack he had taught his 
brothers to build. He was considered a transgressor who ventured into forbidden territory. But 
thereafter, men could travel past any horizon. He had left them a gift they had not conceived and he 
had opened the roads of the world. 

“That man, the unsubmissive and first, stands in the opening chapter of every legend mankind has 
recorded about its beginning. Prometheus was chained to a rock and torn by vultures — because he had 
stolen the fire of the gods. Adam was condemned to suffer — because he had eaten the fruit of the tree 
of knowledge. Whatever the legend, somewhere in the shadows of its memory mankind knew that its 



glory began with one and that that one paid for his courage. 

“Throughout the centuries there were men who took first steps down new roads armed with nothing 
but their own vision. Their goals differed, but they all had this in common: that the step was first, the 
road new, the vision unborrowed, and the response they received — hatred. The great creators — the 
thinkers, the artists, the scientists, the inventors — stood alone against the men of their time. Every 
great new thought was opposed. Every great new invention was denounced. The first motor was 
considered foolish. The airplane was considered impossible. The power loom was considered 
vicious. Anesthesia was considered sinful. But the men of unborrowed vision went ahead. They 
fought, they suffered and they paid. But they won. 

“No creator was prompted by a desire to serve his brothers, for his brothers rejected the gift he 
offered and that gift destroyed the slothful routine of their lives. His truth was his only motive. His 
own truth, and his own work to achieve it in his own way. A symphony, a book, an engine, a 
philosophy, an airplane or a building — that was his goal and his life. Not those who heard, read, 
operated, believed, flew or inhabited the thing he had created. The creation, not its users. The 
creation, not the benefits others derived from it. The creation which gave form to his truth. He held 
his truth above all things and against all men. 

“His vision, his strength, his courage came from his own spirit. A man’s spirit, however, is his self. 
That entity which is his consciousness. To think, to feel, to judge, to act are functions of the ego. 

“The creators were not selfless. It is the whole secret of their power — that it was self-sufficient, 
self-motivated, self-generated. A first cause, a fount of energy, a life force, a Prime Mover. The 
creator served nothing and no one. He lived for himself. 

“And only by living for himself was he able to achieve the things which are the glory of mankind. 
Such is the nature of achievement. 

“Man cannot survive except through his mind. He comes on earth unarmed. His brain is his only 
weapon. Animals obtain food by force. Man has no claws, no fangs, no horns, no great strength of 
muscle. He must plant his food or hunt it. To plant, he needs a process of thought. To hunt, he needs 
weapons, and to make weapons — a process of thought. From this simplest necessity to the highest 
religious abstraction, from the wheel to the skyscraper, everything we are and everything we have 
comes from a single attribute of man — the function of his reasoning mind. 

“But the mind is an attribute of the individual. There is no such thing as a collective brain. There is 
no such thing as a collective thought. An agreement reached by a group of men is only a compromise 
or an average drawn upon many individual thoughts. It is a secondary consequence. The primary act 
— the process of reason — must be performed by each man alone. We can divide a meal among many 
men. We cannot digest it in a collective stomach. No man can use his lungs to breathe for another man. 
No man can use his brain to think for another. All the functions of body and spirit are private. They 
cannot be shared or transferred. 

“We inherit the products of the thought of other men. We inherit the wheel. We make a cart. The cart 
becomes an automobile. The automobile becomes an airplane. But all through the process what we 
receive from others is only the end product of their thinking. The moving force is the creative faculty 
which takes this product as material, uses it and originates the next step. This creative faculty cannot 
be given or received, shared or borrowed. It belongs to single, individual men. That which it creates 
is the property of the creator. Men learn from one another. But all learning is only the exchange of 
material. No man can give another the capacity to think. Yet that capacity is our only means of 



survival. 

“Nothing is given to man on earth. Everything he needs has to be produced. And here man faces his 
basic alternative: he can survive in only one of two ways — by the independent work of his own mind 
or as a parasite fed by the minds of others. The creator originates. The parasite borrows. The creator 
faces nature alone. The parasite faces nature through an intermediary. 

“The creator’s concern is the conquest of nature. The parasite’s concern is the conquest of men. 

“The creator lives for his work. He needs no other men. His primary goal is within himself. The 
parasite lives second-hand. He needs others. Others become his prime motive. 

“The basic need of the creator is independence. The reasoning mind cannot work under any form of 
compulsion. It cannot be curbed, sacrificed or subordinated to any consideration whatsoever. It 
demands total independence in function and in motive. To a creator, all relations with men are 
secondary. 

“The basic need of the second-hander is to secure his ties with men in order to be fed. He places 
relations first. He declares that man exists in order to serve others. He preaches altruism. 

“Altruism is the doctrine which demands that man live for others and place others above self. 

“No man can live for another. He cannot share his spirit just as he cannot share his body. But the 
second-hander has used altruism as a weapon of exploitation and reversed the base of mankind’s 
moral principles. Men have been taught every precept that destroys the creator. Men have been taught 
dependence as a virtue. 

“The man who attempts to live for others is a dependent. He is a parasite in motive and makes 
parasites of those he serves. The relationship produces nothing but mutual corruption. It is impossible 
in concept. The nearest approach to it in reality — the man who lives to serve others — is the slave. If 
physical slavery is repulsive, how much more repulsive is the concept of servility of the spirit? The 
conquered slave has a vestige of honor. He has the merit of having resisted and of considering his 
condition evil. But the man who enslaves himself voluntarily in the name of love is the basest of 
creatures. He degrades the dignity of man and he degrades the conception of love. But this is the 
essence of altruism. 

“Men have been taught that the highest virtue is not to achieve, but to give. Yet one cannot give that 
which has not been created. Creation comes before distribution — or there will be nothing to 
distribute. The need of the creator comes before the need of any possible beneficiary. Yet we are 
taught to admire the second-hander who dispenses gifts he has not produced above the man who made 
the gifts possible. We praise an act of charity. We shrug at an act of achievement. 

“Men have been taught that their first concern is to relieve the suffering of others. But suffering is a 
disease. Should one come upon it, one tries to give relief and assistance. To make that the highest test 
of virtue is to make suffering the most important part of life. Then man must wish to see others suffer 
— in order that he may be virtuous. Such is the nature of altruism. The creator is not concerned with 
disease, but with life. Yet the work of the creators has eliminated one form of disease after another, in 
man’s body and spirit, and brought more relief from suffering than any altruist could ever conceive. 

“Men have been taught that it is a virtue to agree with others. But the creator is the man who 
disagrees. Men have been taught that it is a virtue to swim with the current. But the creator is the man 
who goes against the current. Men have been taught that it is a virtue to stand together. But the creator 
is the man who stands alone. 

“Men have been taught that the ego is the synonym of evil, and selflessness the ideal of virtue. But 



the creator is the egoist in the absolute sense, and the selfless man is the one who does not think, feel, 
judge or act. These are functions of the self. 

“Here the basic reversal is most deadly. The issue has been perverted and man has been left no 
alternative — and no freedom. As poles of good and evil, he was offered two conceptions: egoism and 
altruism. Egoism was held to mean the sacrifice of others to self. Altruism — the sacrifice of self to 
others. This tied man irrevocably to other men and left him nothing but a choice of pain: his own pain 
borne for the sake of others or pain inflicted upon others for the sake of self. When it was added that 
man must find joy in self-immolation, the trap was closed. Man was forced to accept masochism as 
his ideal — under the threat that sadism was his only alternative. This was the greatest fraud ever 
perpetrated on mankind. 

“This was the device by which dependence and suffering were perpetuated as fundamentals of life. 

“The choice is not self-sacrifice or domination. The choice is independence or dependence. The 
code of the creator or the code of the second-hander. This is the basic issue. It rests upon the 
alternative of life or death. The code of the creator is built on the needs of the reasoning mind which 
allows man to survive. The code of the second-hander is built on the needs of a mind incapable of 
survival. All that which proceeds from man’s independent ego is good. All that which proceeds from 
man’s dependence upon men is evil. 

“The egoist in the absolute sense is not the man who sacrifices others. He is the man who stands 
above the need of using others in any manner. He does not function through them. He is not concerned 
with them in any primary matter. Not in his aim, not in his motive, not in his thinking, not in his 
desires, not in the source of his energy. He does not exist for any other man — and he asks no other 
man to exist for him. This is the only form of brotherhood and mutual respect possible between men. 

“Degrees of ability vary, but the basic principle remains the same: the degree of a man’s 
independence, initiative and personal love for his work determines his talent as a worker and his 
worth as a man. Independence is the only gauge of human virtue and value. What a man is and makes 
of himself; not what he has or hasn’t done for others. There is no substitute for personal dignity. There 
is no standard of personal dignity except independence. 

“In all proper relationships there is no sacrifice of anyone to anyone. An architect needs clients, 
but he does not subordinate his work to their wishes. They need him, but they do not order a house 
just to give him a commission. Men exchange their work by free, mutual consent to mutual advantage 
when their personal interests agree and they both desire the exchange. If they do not desire it, they are 
not forced to deal with each other. They seek further. This is the only possible form of relationship 
between equals. Anything else is a relation of slave to master, or victim to executioner. 

“No work is ever done collectively, by a majority decision. Every creative job is achieved under 
the guidance of a single individual thought. An architect requires a great many men to erect his 
building. But he does not ask them to vote on his design. They work together by free agreement and 
each is free in his proper function. An architect uses steel, glass, concrete, produced by others. But 
the materials remain just so much steel, glass and concrete until he touches them. What he does with 
them is his individual product and his individual property. This is the only pattern for proper co- 
operation among men. 

“The first right on earth is the right of the ego. Man’s first duty is to himself. His moral law is never 
to place his prime goal within the persons of others. His moral obligation is to do what he wishes, 
provided his wish does not depend primarily upon other men. This includes the whole sphere of his 



creative faculty, his thinking, his work. But it does not include the sphere of the gangster, the altruist 
and the dictator. 

“A man thinks and works alone. A man cannot rob, exploit or rule — alone. Robbery, exploitation 
and ruling presuppose victims. They imply dependence. They are the province of the second-hander. 

“Rulers of men are not egoists. They create nothing. They exist entirely through the persons of 
others. Their goal is in their subjects, in the activity of enslaving. They are as dependent as the 
beggar, the social worker and the bandit. The form of dependence does not matter. 

“But men were taught to regard second-handers — tyrants, emperors, dictators — as exponents of 
egoism. By this fraud they were made to destroy the ego, themselves and others. The purpose of the 
fraud was to destroy the creators. Or to harness them. Which is a synonym. 

“From the beginning of history, the two antagonists have stood face to face: the creator and the 
second-hander. When the first creator invented the wheel, the first second-hander responded. He 
invented altruism. 

“The creator — denied, opposed, persecuted, exploited — went on, moved forward and carried all 
humanity along on his energy. The second-hander contributed nothing to the process except the 
impediments. The contest has another name: the individual against the collective. 

“The ‘common good’ of a collective — a race, a class, a state — was the claim and justification of 
every tyranny ever established over men. Every major horror of history was committed in the name of 
an altruistic motive. Has any act of selfishness ever equaled the carnage perpetrated by disciples of 
altruism? Does the fault lie in men’s hypocrisy or in the nature of the principle? The most dreadful 
butchers were the most sincere. They believed in the perfect society reached through the guillotine 
and the firing squad. Nobody questioned their right to murder since they were murdering for an 
altruistic purpose. It was accepted that man must be sacrificed for other men. Actors change, but the 
course of the tragedy remains the same. A humanitarian who starts with declarations of love for 
mankind and ends with a sea of blood. It goes on and will go on so long as men believe that an action 
is good if it is unselfish. That permits the altruist to act and forces his victims to bear it. The leaders 
of collectivist movements ask nothing for themselves. But observe the results. 

“The only good which men can do to one another and the only statement of their proper relationship 
is — Hands off! 

“Now observe the results of a society built on the principle of individualism. This, our country. 
The noblest country in the history of men. The country of greatest achievement, greatest prosperity, 
greatest freedom. This country was not based on selfless service, sacrifice, renunciation or any 
precept of altruism. It was based on a man’s right to the pursuit of happiness. His own happiness. Not 
anyone else’s. A private, personal, selfish motive. Look at the results. Look into your own 
conscience. 

“It is an ancient conflict. Men have come close to the truth, but it was destroyed each time and one 
civilization fell after another. Civilization is the progress toward a society of privacy. The savage’s 
whole existence is public, ruled by the laws of his tribe. Civilization is the process of setting man 
free from men. 

“Now, in our age, collectivism, the rule of the second-hander and second-rater, the ancient monster, 
has broken loose and is running amuck. It has brought men to a level of intellectual indecency never 
equaled on earth. It has reached a scale of horror without precedent. It has poisoned every mind. It 
has swallowed most of Europe. It is engulfing our country. 



“I am an architect. I know what is to come by the principle on which it is built. We are approaching 
a world in which I cannot permit myself to live. 

“Now you know why I dynamited Cortlandt. 

“I designed Cortlandt. I gave it to you. I destroyed it. 

“I destroyed it because I did not choose to let it exist. It was a double monster. In form and in 
implication. I had to blast both. The form was mutilated by two second-handers who assumed the 
right to improve upon that which they had not made and could not equal. They were permitted to do it 
by the general implication that the altruistic purpose of the building superseded all rights and that I 
had no claim to stand against it. 

“I agreed to design Cortlandt for the purpose of seeing it erected as I designed it and for no other 
reason. That was the price I set for my work. I was not paid. 

“I do not blame Peter Keating. He was helpless. He had a contract with his employers. It was 
ignored. He had a promise that the structure he offered would be built as designed. The promise was 
broken. The love of a man for the integrity of his work and his right to preserve it are now considered 
a vague intangible and an inessential. You have heard the prosecutor say that. Why was the building 
disfigured? For no reason. Such acts never have any reason, unless it’s the vanity of some second- 
handers who feel they have a right to anyone’s property, spiritual or material. Who permitted them to 
do it? No particular man among the dozens in authority. No one cared to permit or to stop it. No one 
was responsible. No one can be held to account. Such is the nature of all collective action. 

“I did not receive the payment I asked. But the owners of Cortlandt got what they needed from me. 
They wanted a scheme devised to build a structure as cheaply as possible. They found no one else 
who could do it to their satisfaction. I could and did. They took the benefit of my work and made me 
contribute it as a gift. But I am not an altruist. I do not contribute gifts of this nature. 

“It is said that I have destroyed the home of the destitute. It is forgotten that but for me the destitute 
could not have had this particular home. Those who were concerned with the poor had to come to me, 
who have never been concerned, in order to help the poor. It is believed that the poverty of the future 
tenants gave them a right to my work. That their need constituted a claim on my life. That it was my 
duty to contribute anything demanded of me. This is the second-hander’s credo now swallowing the 
world. 

“I came here to say that I do not recognize anyone’s right to one minute of my life. Nor to any part 
of my energy. Nor to any achievement of mine. No matter who makes the claim, how large their 
number or how great their need. 

“I wished to come here and say that I am a man who does not exist for others. 

“It had to be said. The world is perishing from an orgy of self-sacrificing. 

“I wished to come here and say that the integrity of a man’s creative work is of greater importance 
than any charitable endeavor. Those of you who do not understand this are the men who ’re destroying 
the world. 

“I wished to come here and state my terms. I do not care to exist on any others. 

“I recognize no obligations toward men except one: to respect their freedom and to take no part in a 
slave society. To my country, I wish to give the ten years which I will spend in jail if my country 
exists no longer. I will spend them in memory and in gratitude for what my country has been. It will be 
my act of loyalty, my refusal to live or work in what has taken its place. 

“My act of loyalty to every creator who ever lived and was made to suffer by the force responsible 



for the Cortlandt I dynamited. To every tortured hour of loneliness, denial, frustration, abuse he was 
made to spend — and to the battles he won. To every creator whose name is known — and to every 
creator who lived, struggled and perished unrecognized before he could achieve. To every creator 
who was destroyed in body or in spirit. To Henry Cameron. To Steven Mallory. To a man who 
doesn’t want to be named, but who is sitting in this courtroom and knows that I am speaking of him.” 



Atlas Shrugged 


C2 J &lt;^&gt; 


This novel was published in 1957. Its theme is: the role of the mind in man s existence — and, as 
corollary, the demonstration of a new moral philosophy: the morality of rational self-interest. 

The story shows what happens to the world when the mind goes on strike — when the men oj 
creative ability, in every profession, quit and disappear. To quote John Galt, the leader and 
initiator of the strike: “There is only one kind of men who have never been on strike in human 
history. Every other kind and class have stopped, when they so wished, and have presented 
demands to the world, claiming to be indispensable — except the men who have carried the world 
on their shoulders, have kept it alive, have endured torture as sole payment, but have never walked 
out on the human race. Well, their turn has come. Let the world discover who they are, what they 
do and what happens when they refuse to function. This is the strike of the men of the mind. ” 


THE MEANING OF MONEY 


This is a speech made by Francisco d’Anconia, copper industrialist, heir to an enormous fortune, 
Galt’s closest friend and first to join him in going on strike. 

“So you think that money is the root of all evil?” said Francisco d’Anconia. “Have you ever asked 
what is the root of money? Money is a tool of exchange, which can’t exist unless there are goods 
produced and men able to produce them. Money is the material shape of the principle that men who 
wish to deal with one another must deal by trade and give value for value. Money is not the tool of the 
moochers, who claim your product by tears, or of the looters, who take it from you by force. Money is 
made possible only by the men who produce. Is this what you consider evil? 

“When you accept money in payment for your effort, you do so only on the conviction that you will 
exchange it for the product of the effort of others. It is not the moochers or the looters who give value 
to money. Not an ocean of tears nor all the guns in the world can transform those pieces of paper in 
your wallet into the bread you will need to survive tomorrow. Those pieces of paper, which should 
have been gold, are a token of honor — your claim upon the energy of the men who produce. Your 
wallet is your statement of hope that somewhere in the world around you there are men who will not 
default on that moral principle which is the root of money. Is this what you consider evil? 

“Have you ever looked for the root of production? Take a look at an electric generator and dare tell 
yourself that it was created by the muscular effort of unthinking brutes. Try to grow a seed of wheat 
without the knowledge left to you by men who had to discover it for the first time. Try to obtain your 
food by means of nothing but physical motions — and you’ll learn that man’s mind is the root of all the 
goods produced and of all the wealth that has ever existed on earth. 

“But you say that money is made by the strong at the expense of the weak? What strength do you 



mean? It is not the strength of guns or muscles. Wealth is the product of man’s capacity to think. Then 
is money made by the man who invents a motor at the expense of those who did not invent it? Is 
money made by the intelligent at the expense of the fools? By the able at the expense of the 
incompetent? By the ambitious at the expense of the lazy? Money is made — before it can be looted or 
mooched — made by the effort of every honest man, each to the extent of his ability. An honest man is 
one who knows that he can’t consume more than he has produced. 

“To trade by means of money is the code of the men of good will. Money rests on the axiom that 
every man is the owner of his mind and his effort. Money allows no power to prescribe the value of 
your effort except the voluntary choice of the man who is willing to trade you his effort in return. 
Money permits you to obtain for your goods and your labor that which they are worth to the men who 
buy them, but no more. Money permits no deals except those to mutual benefit by the unforced 
judgment of the traders. Money demands of you the recognition that men must work for their own 
benefit, not for their own injury, for their gain, not their loss — the recognition that they are not beasts 
of burden, born to carry the weight of your misery — that you must offer them values, not wounds — that 
the common bond among men is not the exchange of suffering, but the exchange of goods. Money 
demands that you sell, not your weakness to men’s stupidity, but your talent to their reason; it demands 
that you buy, not the shoddiest they offer, but the best that your money can find. And when men live by 
trade — with reason, not force, as their final arbiter — it is the best product that wins, the best 
performance, the man of best judgment and highest ability — and the degree of a man’s productiveness 
is the degree of his reward. This is the code of existence whose tool and symbol is money. Is this 
what you consider evil? 

“But money is only a tool. It will take you wherever you wish, but it will not replace you as the 
driver. It will give you the means for the satisfaction of your desires, but it will not provide you with 
desires. Money is the scourge of the men who attempt to reverse the law of causality — the men who 
seek to replace the mind by seizing the products of the mind. 

“Money will not purchase happiness for the man who has no concept of what he wants: money will 
not give him a code of values, if he’s evaded the knowledge of what to value, and it will not provide 
him with a purpose, if he’s evaded the choice of what to seek. Money will not buy intelligence for the 
fool, or admiration for the coward, or respect for the incompetent. The man who attempts to purchase 
the brains of his superiors to serve him, with his money replacing his judgment, ends up by becoming 
the victim of his inferiors. The men of intelligence desert him, but the cheats and the frauds come 
flocking to him, drawn by a law which he has not discovered: that no man may be smaller than his 
money. Is this the reason why you call it evil? 

“Only the man who does not need it, is fit to inherit wealth — the man who would make his own 
fortune no matter where he started. If an heir is equal to his money, it serves him; if not, it destroys 
him. But you look on and you cry that money corrupted him Did it? Or did he corrupt his money? Do 
not envy a worthless heir; his wealth is not yours and you would have done no better with it. Do not 
think that it should have been distributed among you; loading the world with fifty parasites instead of 
one, would not bring back the dead virtue which was the fortune. Money is a living power that dies 
without its root. Money will not serve the mind that cannot match it. Is this the reason why you call it 
evil? 

“Money is your means of survival. The verdict you pronounce upon the source of your livelihood is 
the verdict you pronounce upon your life. If the source is corrupt, you have damned your own 



existence. Did you get your money by fraud? By pandering to men’s vices or men’s stupidity? By 
catering to fools, in the hope of getting more than your ability deserves? By lowering your standards? 
By doing work you despise for purchasers you scorn? If so, then your money will not give you a 
moment’s or a penny’s worth of joy Then all the things you buy will become, not a tribute to you, but 
a reproach; not an achievement, but a reminder of shame. Then you’ll scream that money is evil. Evil, 
because it would not pinch- hit for your self-respect? Evil, because it would not let you enjoy your 
depravity? Is this the root of your hatred of money? 

“Money will always remain an effect and refuse to replace you as the cause. Money is the product 
of virtue, but it will not give you virtue and it will not redeem your vices. Money will not give you 
the unearned, neither in matter nor in spirit. Is this the root of your hatred of money? 

“Or did you say it’s the love of money that’s the root of all evil? To love a thing is to know and 
love its nature. To love money is to know and love the fact that money is the creation of the best 
power within you, and your passkey to trade your effort for the effort of the best among men. It’s the 
person who would sell his soul for a nickel, who is loudest in proclaiming his hatred of money — and 
he has good reason to hate it. The lovers of money are willing to work for it. They know they are able 
to deserve it. 

“Let me give you a tip on a clue to men’s characters: the man who damns money has obtained it 
dishonorably; the man who respects it has earned it. 

“Run for your life from any man who tells you that money is evil. That setence is the leper’s bell of 
an approaching looter. So long as men live together on earth and need means to deal with one another 
— their only substitute, if they abandon money, is the muzzle of a gun. 

“But money demands of you the highest virtues, if you wish to make it or to keep it. Men who have 
no courage, pride or self-esteem, men who have no moral sense of their right to their money and are 
not willing to defend it as they defend their life, men who apologize for being rich — will not remain 
rich for long. They are the natural bait for the swarms of looters that stay under rocks for centuries, 
but come crawling out at the first smell of a man who begs to be forgiven for the guilt of owning 
wealth. They will hasten to relieve him of the guilt — and of his life, as he deserves. 

“Then you will see the rise of the men of the double standard — the men who live by force, yet 
count on those who live by trade to create the value of their looted money — the men who are the 
hitchhikers of virtue. In a moral society, these are the criminals, and the statutes are written to protect 
you against them. But when a society establishes criminals-by-right and looters-by-law — men who 
use force to seize the wealth of disarmed victims — then money becomes its creators’ avenger. Such 
looters believe it safe to rob defenseless men, once they’ve passed a law to disarm them But their 
loot becomes the magnet for other looters, who get it from them as they got it. Then the race goes, not 
to the ablest at production, but to those most ruthless at brutality. When force is the standard, the 
murderer wins over the pickpocket. And then that society vanishes, in a spread of ruins and slaughter. 

“Do you wish to know whether that day is coming? Watch money. Money is the barometer of a 
society’s virtue. When you see that trading is done, not by consent, but by compulsion — when you see 
that in order to produce, you need to obtain permission from men who produce nothing — when you 
see that money is flowing to those who deal, not in goods, but in favors — when you see that men get 
richer by graft and by pull than by work, and your laws don’t protect you against them, but protect 
them against you — when you see corruption being rewarded and honesty becoming a self-sacrifice — 
you may know that your society is doomed. Money is so noble a medium that it does not compete with 



guns and it does not make terms with brutality. It will not permit a country to survive as half-property, 
half-loot. 

“Whenever destroyers appear among men, they start by destroying money, for money is men’s 
protection and the base of a moral existence. Destroyers seize gold and leave to its owners a 
counterfeit pile of paper. This kills all objective standards and delivers men into the arbitrary power 
of an arbitrary setter of values. Gold was an objective value, an equivalent of wealth produced. 
Paper is a mortgage on wealth that does not exist, backed by a gun aimed at those who are expected to 
produce it. Paper is a check drawn by legal looters upon an account which is not theirs: upon the 
virtue of the victims. Watch for the day when it bounces, marked: ‘Account overdrawn.’ 

“When you have made evil the means of survival, do not expect men to remain good. Do not expect 
them to stay moral and lose their lives for the purpose of becoming the fodder of the immoral. Do not 
expect them to produce, when production is punished and looting rewarded. Do not ask, ‘Who is 
destroying the world?’ You are. 

“You stand in the midst of the greatest achievements of the greatest productive civilization and you 
wonder why it’s crumbling around you, while you’re damning its life-blood — money. You look upon 
money as the savages did before you, and you wonder why the jungle is creeping back to the edge of 
your cities. Throughout men’s history, money was always seized by looters of one brand or another, 
whose names changed, but whose method remained the same: to seize wealth by force and to keep the 
producers bound, demeaned, defamed, deprived of honor. That phrase about the evil of money, which 
you mouth with such righteous recklessness, comes from a time when wealth was produced by the 
labor of slaves — slaves who repeated the motions once discovered by somebody’s mind and left 
unimproved for centuries. So long as production was ruled by force, and wealth was obtained by 
conquest, there was little to conquer. Yet through all the centuries of stagnation and starvation, men 
exalted the looters, as aristocrats of the sword, as aristocrats of birth, as aristocrats of the bureau, and 
despised the producers, as slaves, as traders, as shopkeepers — as industrialists. 

“To the glory of mankind, there was, for the first and only time in history, a country of money — and 
I have no higher, more reverent tribute to pay to America, for this means: a country of reason, justice, 
freedom, production, achievement. For the first time, man’s mind and money were set free, and there 
were no fortunes-by-conquest, but only fortunes-by-work, and instead of swordsmen and slaves, there 
appeared the real maker of wealth, the greatest worker, the highest type of human being — the self- 
made man — the American industrialist. 

“If you ask me to name the proudest distinction of Americans, I would choose — because it contains 
all the others — the fact that they were the people who created the phrase ‘to make money.’ No other 
language or nation had ever used these words before; men had always thought of wealth as a static 
quantity — to be seized, begged, inherited, shared, looted or obtained as a favor. Americans were the 
first to understand that wealth has to be created. The words ‘to make money’ hold the essence of 
human morality. 

“Yet these were the words for which Americans were denounced by the rotted cultures of the 
looters’ continents. Now the looters’ credo has brought you to regard your proudest achievements as a 
hallmark of shame, your prosperity as guilt, your greatest men, the industrialists, as blackguards, and 
your magnificent factories as the product and property of muscular labor, the labor of whip-driven 
slaves, like the pyramids of Egypt. The rotter who simpers that he sees no difference between the 
power of the dollar and the power of the whip, ought to learn the difference on his own hide — as, I 



think, he will. 

“Until and unless you discover that money is the root of all good, you ask for your own destruction. 
When money ceases to be the tool by which men deal with one another, then men become the tools of 
men. Blood, whips and guns — or dollars. Take your choice — there is no other — and your time is 
running out.” 


THE MARTYRDOM OF THE INDUSTRIALISTS 


This is part of a conversation between Francisco d’Anconia and Hank Rearden, a self-made man 
who has risen to the position of the country s greatest steel industrialist. (Francisco speaking.) 

“You, who would not submit to the hardships of nature, but set out to conquer it and placed it in the 
service of your joy and your comfort — to what have you submitted at the hands of men? You, who 
know from your work that one bears punishment only for being wrong — what have you been willing 
to bear and for what reason? All your life, you have heard yourself denounced, not for your faults, but 
for your greatest virtues. You have been hated, not for your mistakes, but for your achievements. You 
have been scorned for all those qualities of character which are your highest pride. You have been 
called selfish for the courage of acting on your own judgment and bearing sole responsibility for your 
own life. You have been called arrogant for your independent mind. You have been called cruel for 
your unyielding integrity. You have been called anti-social for the vision that made you venture upon 
undiscovered roads. You have been called ruthless for the strength and self-discipline of your drive to 
your purpose. You have been called greedy for the magnificence of your power to create wealth. You, 
who’ve expended an inconceivable flow of energy, have been called a parasite. You, who’ve created 
abundance where there had been nothing but wastelands and helpless, starving men before you, have 
been called a robber. You, who’ve kept them all alive, have been called an exploiter. You, the purest 
and most moral man among them, have been sneered at as a ‘vulgar materialist.’ Have you stopped to 
ask them: by what right? — by what code? — by what standard? No, you have borne it all and kept 
silent. You bowed to their code and you never upheld your own. You knew what exacting morality 
was needed to produce a single metal nail, but you let them brand you as immoral. You knew that man 
needs the strictest code of values to deal with nature, but you thought that you needed no such code to 
deal with men. You left the deadliest weapon in the hands of your enemies, a weapon you never 
suspected or understood. Their moral code is their weapon. Ask yourself how deeply and in how 
many terrible ways you have accepted it. Ask yourself what it is that a code of moral values does to a 
man’s life, and why he can’t exist without it, and what happens to him if he accepts the wrong 
standard, by which the evil is the good. Shall I tell you why you’re drawn to me, even though you 
think you ought to damn me? It’s because I’m the first man who has given you what the whole world 
owes you and what you should have demanded of all men before you dealt with them: a moral 
sanction. . . . 

“You’re guilty of a great sin, Mr. Rearden, much guiltier than they tell you, but not in the way they 
preach. The worst guilt is to accept an undeserved guilt — and that is what you have been doing all 
your life. You have been paying blackmail, not for your vices, but for your virtues. You have been 
willing to carry the load of an unearned punishment — and to let it grow the heavier the greater the 



virtues you practiced. But your virtues were those which keep men alive. Your own moral code — the 
one you lived by, but never stated, acknowledged or defended — was the code that preserves man’s 
existence. If you were punished for it, what was the nature of those who punished you? Yours was the 
code of life. What, then, is theirs? What standard of value lies at its root? What is its ultimate 
purpose? Do you think that what you’re facing is merely a conspiracy to seize your wealth? You, who 
know the source of wealth, should know it’s much more and much worse than that. Did you ask me to 
name man’s motive power? Man’s motive power is his moral code. Ask yourself where their code is 
leading you and what it offers you as your final goal. A viler evil than to murder a man, is to sell him 
suicide as an act of virtue. A viler evil than to throw a man into a sacrificial furnace, is to demand 
that he leap in, of his own will, and that he build the furnace, besides. By their own statement, it is 
they who need you and have nothing to offer you in return. By their own statement, you must support 
them because they cannot survive without you. Consider the obscenity of offering their impotence and 
their need — their need of you — as a justification for your torture. Are you willing to accept it? Do 
you care to purchase — at the price of your great endurance, at the price of your agony — the 
satisfaction of the needs of your own destroyers? . . . 

“If you saw Atlas, the giant who holds the world on his shoulders, if you saw that he stood, blood 
running down his chest, his knees buckling, his arms trembling but still trying to hold the world aloft 
with the last of his strength, and the greater his effort the heavier the world bore down upon his 
shoulders — what would you tell him to do?” 

“I . . . don’t know. What . . . could he do? What would you tell him?” 

“To shrug.” 


THE MORAL MEANING OF CAPITALISM 


This is a statement made by Hank Rearden at his trial for an illegal sale of a metal alloy which he 
had created and which has been placed under government rationing and control. 

“I do not want my attitude to be misunderstood. I shall be glad to state it for the record. ... I work 
for nothing but my own profit — which I make by selling a product they need to men who are willing 
and able to buy it. I do not produce it for their benefit at the expense of mine, and they do not buy it 
for my benefit at the expense of theirs; I do not sacrifice my interests to them nor do they sacrifice 
theirs to me; we deal as equals by mutual consent to mutual advantage — and I am proud of every 
penny that I have earned in this manner. I am rich and I am proud of every penny I own. I have made 
my money by my own effort, in free exchange and through the voluntary consent of every man I dealt 
with — the voluntary consent of those who employed me when I started, the voluntary consent of those 
who work for me now, the voluntary consent of those who buy my product. I shall answer all the 
questions you are afraid to ask me openly. Do I wish to pay my workers more than their services are 
worth to me? I do not. Do I wish to sell my product for less than my customers are willing to pay me? 
I do not. Do I wish to sell it at a loss or give it away? I do not. If this is evil, do whatever you please 
about me, according to whatever standards you hold. These are mine. I am earning my own living, as 
every honest man must. I refuse to accept as guilt the fact of my own existence and the fact that I must 



work in order to support it. I refuse to accept as guilt the fact that I am able to do it and to do it well. I 
refuse to accept as guilt the fact that I am able to do it better than most people — the fact that my work 
is of greater value than the work of my neighbors and that more men are willing to pay me. I refuse to 
apologize for my ability — I refuse to apologize for my success — I refuse to apologize for my money. 
If this is evil, make the most of it. If this is what the public finds harmful to its interests let the public 
destroy me. This is my code — and I will accept no other. I could say to you that I have done more 
good for my fellow man than you can ever hope to accomplish — but I will not say it, because I do not 
seek the good of others as a sanction for my right to exist, nor do I recognize the good of others as a 
justification for their seizure of my property or their destruction of my life. I will not say that the good 
of others was the purpose of my work — my own good was my purpose, and I despise the man who 
surrenders his. I could say to you that you do not serve the public good — that nobody’s good can be 
achieved at the price of human sacrifices — that when you violate the rights of one man, you have 
violated the rights of all, and a public of rightless creatures is doomed to destruction. I could say to 
you that you will and can achieve nothing but universal devastation — as any looter must, when he runs 
out of victims. I could say it, but I won’t. It is not your particular policy that I challenge, but your 
moral premise. If it were true that men could achieve their good by means of turning some men into 
sacrificial animals, and I were asked to immolate myself for the sake of creatures who wanted to 
survive at the price of my blood, if I were asked to serve the interests of society apart from, above 
and against my own — I would refuse, I would reject it as the most contemptible evil, I would fight it 
with every power I possess, I would fight the whole of mankind, if one minute were all I could last 
before I were murdered, I would fight in the full confidence of the justice of my battle and of a living 
being’s right to exist. Let there be no misunderstanding about me. If it is now the belief of my fellow 
men, who call themselves the public, that their good requires victims, then I say: The public good be 
damned, I will have no part of it!” 


THE MEANING OF SEX 


This is from a conversation between Francisco d’Anconia and Hank Rearden, who are in love with 
the same woman, though neither one of them knows it. (Francisco speaking.) 

“Do you remember what I said about money and about the men who seek to reverse the law of 
cause and effect? The men who try to replace the mind by seizing the products of the mind? Well, the 
man who despises himself tries to gain self-esteem from sexual adventures — which can’t be done, 
because sex is not the cause, but an effect and an expression of a man’s sense of his own value. . . . 

“The men who think that wealth comes from material resources and has no intellectual root or 
meaning, are the men who think — for the same reason — that sex is a physical capacity which functions 
independently of one’s mind, choice or code of values. They think that your body creates a desire and 
makes a choice for you — just about in some such way as if iron ore transformed itself into railroad 
rails of its own volition. Love is blind, they say; sex is impervious to reason and mocks the power of 
all philosophers. But, in fact, a man’s sexual choice is the result and the sum of his fundamental 
convictions. Tell me what a man finds sexually attractive and I will tell you his entire philosophy of 
life. Show me the woman he sleeps with and I will tell you his valuation of himself. No matter what 



corruption he’s taught about the virtue of selflessness, sex is the most profoundly selfish of all acts, an 
act which he cannot perform for any motive but his own enjoyment — just try to think of performing it 
in a spirit of selfless charity! — an act which is not possible in self-abasement, only in self-exaltation, 
only in the confidence of being desired and being worthy of desire. It is an act that forces him to stand 
naked in spirit, as well as in body, and to accept his real ego as his standard of value. He will always 
be attracted to the woman who reflects his deepest vision of himself, the woman whose surrender 
permits him to experience — or to fake — a sense of self-esteem The man who is proudly certain of his 
own value, will want the highest type of woman he can find, the woman he admires, the strongest, the 
hardest to conquer — because only the possession of a heroine will give him the sense of an 
achievement, not the possession of a brainless slut. ... He does not seek to gain his value, he seeks to 
express it. There is no co nfl ict between the standards of his mind and the desires of his body. 

“But the man who is convinced of his own worthlessness will be drawn to a woman he despises — 
because she will reflect his own secret self, she will release him from that objective reality in which 
he is a fraud, she will give him a momentary illusion of his own value and a momentary escape from 
the moral code that damns him. Observe the ugly mess which most men make of their sex lives — and 
observe the mess of contradictions which they hold as their moral philosophy. One proceeds from the 
other. Love is our response to our highest values — and can be nothing else. Let a man corrupt his 
values and his view of existence, let him profess that love is not self-enjoyment but self-denial, that 
virtue consists, not of pride, but of pity or pain or weakness or sacrifice, that the noblest love is born, 
not of admiration, but of charity, not in response to values, but in response to flaws — and he will have 
cut himself in two. His body will not obey him, it will not respond, it will make him impotent toward 
the woman he professes to love and draw him to the lowest type of whore he can find. His body will 
always follow the ultimate logic of his deepest convictions; if he believes that flaws are values, he 
has damned existence as evil and only the evil will attract him. He has damned himself and he will 
feel that depravity is all he is worthy of enjoying. He has equated virtue with pain and he will feel 
that vice is the only realm of pleasure. Then he will scream that his body has vicious desires of its 
own which his mind cannot conquer, that sex is sin, that true love is a pure emotion of the spirit. And 
then he will wonder why love brings him nothing but boredom, and sex — nothing but shame. . . . 

“You’d never accept any part of their vicious creed. You wouldn’t be able to force it upon yourself. 
If you tried to damn sex as evil, you’d still find yourself, against your will, acting on the proper moral 
premise. You’d be attracted to the highest woman you met. You’d always want a heroine. You’d be 
incapable of self-contempt. You’d be unable to believe that existence is evil and that you’re a 
helpless creature caught in an impossible universe. You’re the man who’s spent his life shaping matter 
to the purpose of his mind. You’re the man who would know that just as an idea unexpressed in 
physical action is contemptible hypocrisy, so is platonic love — and just as physical action unguided 
by an idea is a fool’s self-fraud, so is sex when cut off from one’s code of values. It’s the same issue, 
and you would know it. Your inviolate sense of self-esteem would know it. You would be incapable 
of desire for a woman you despised. Only the man who extols the purity of a love devoid of desire, is 
capable of the depravity of a desire devoid of love. But observe that most people are creatures cut in 
half who keep swinging desperately to one side or to the other. One kind of half is the man who 
despises money, factories, skyscrapers and his own body. He holds undefined emotions about non- 
conceivable subjects as the meaning of life and as his claim to virtue. And he cries with despair, 
because he can feel nothing for the women he respects, but finds himself in bondage to an irresistible 



passion for a slut from the gutter. He is the man whom people call an idealist. The other kind of half is 
the man whom people call practical, the man who despises principles, abstractions, art, philosophy 
and his own mind. He regards the acquisition of material objects as the only goal of existence — and 
he laughs at the need to consider their purpose or their source. He expects them to give him pleasure 
— and he wonders why the more he gets, the less he feels. He is the man who spends his time chasing 
women. Observe the triple fraud which he perpetrates upon himself. He will not acknowledge his 
need of self-esteem, since he scoffs at such a concept as moral values; yet he feels the profound self- 
contempt which comes from believing that he is a piece of meat. He will not acknowledge, but he 
knows that sex is the physical expression of a tribute to personal values. So he tries, by going through 
the motions of the effect, to acquire that which should have been the cause. He tries to gain a sense of 
his own value from the women who surrender to him — and he forgets that the women he picks have 
neither character nor judgment nor standard of value. He tells himself that all he’s after is physical 
pleasure — but observe that he tires of his women in a week or a night, that he despises professional 
whores and that he loves to imagine he is seducing virtuous girls who make a great exception for his 
sake. It is the feeling of achievement that he seeks and never finds. What glory can there be in the 
conquest of a mindless body?” 


“FROM EACH ACCORDING TO HIS ABILITY, TO EACH ACCORDING TO 

HIS NEED” 


This is the story of what happened at the Twentieth Century Motor Company, which put the above 
slogan into practice — as told by one of the survivors. 

“Well there was something that happened at that plant where I worked for twenty years. It was 
when the old man died and his heirs took over. There were three of them, two sons and a daughter, 
and they brought a new plan to run the factory. They let us vote on it, too, and everybody — almost 
everybody — voted for it. We didn’t know. We thought it was good. No, that’s not true, either. We 
thought that we were supposed to think it was good. The plan was that everybody in the factory would 
work according to his ability, but would be paid according to his need. . . . 

“We voted for that plan at a big meeting, with all of us present, six thousand of us, everybody that 
worked in the factory. The Starnes heirs made long speeches about it, and it wasn’t too clear, but 
nobody asked any questions. None of us knew just how the plan would work, but every one of us 
thought that the next fellow knew it. And if anybody had doubts, he felt guilty and kept his mouth shut 
— because they made it sound like anyone who’d oppose the plan was a child-killer at heart and less 
than a human being. They told us that this plan would achieve a noble ideal. Well, how were we to 
know otherwise? Hadn’t we heard it all our lives — from our parents and our schoolteachers and our 
ministers, and in every newspaper we ever read and every movie and every public speech? Hadn’t 
we always been told that this was righteous and just? Well, maybe there’s some excuse for what we 
did at that meeting. Still, we voted for the plan — and what we got, we had it coming to us. You know, 
ma’am, we are marked men, in a way, those of us who lived through the four years of that plan in the 
Twentieth Century factory. What is it that hell is supposed to be? Evil — plain, naked, smirking evil, 



isn’t it? Well, that’s what we saw and helped to make — and I think we’re damned, every one of us, 
and maybe we’ll never be forgiven. . . . 

“Do you know how it worked, that plan, and what it did to people? Try pouring water into a tank 
where there’s a pipe at the bottom draining it out faster than you pour it, and each bucket you bring 
breaks that pipe an inch wider, and the harder you work the more is demanded of you, and you stand 
slinging buckets forty hours a week, then forty-eight, then fifty-six — for your neighbor’s supper — for 
his wife’s operation — for his child’s measles — for his mother’s wheel chair — for his uncle’s shirt — 
for his nephew’s schooling — for the baby next door — for the baby to be born — for anyone anywhere 
around you — it’s theirs to receive, from diapers to dentures — and yours to work, from sunup to sun- 
down, month after month, year after year, with nothing to show for it but your sweat, with nothing in 
sight for you but their pleasure, for the whole of your life, without rest, without hope, without end. . . . 
From each according to his ability, to each according to his need. . . . 

“We’re all one big family, they told us, we’re all in this together. But you don’t all stand working 
an acetylene torch ten hours a day — together, and you don’t all get a bellyache — together. What’s 
whose ability and which of whose needs comes first? When it’s all one pot, you can’t let any man 
decide what his own needs are, can you? If you did, he might claim that he needs a yacht — and if his 
feelings is all you have to go by, he might prove it, too. Why not? If it’s not right for me to own a car 
until I’ve worked myself into a hospital ward, earning a car for every loafer and every naked savage 
on earth — why can’t he demand a yacht from me, too, if I still have the ability not to have collapsed? 
No? He can’t? Then why can he demand that I go without cream for my coffee until he’s replastered 
his living room? ... Oh well . . . Well, anyway, it was decided that nobody had the right to judge his 
own need or ability. We voted on it. Yes, ma’am, we voted on it in a public meeting twice a year. 
How else could it be done? Do you care to think what would happen at such a meeting? It took us just 
one meeting to discover that we had become beggars — rotten, whining, sniveling beggars, all of us, 
because no man could claim his pay as his rightful earning, he had no rights and no earnings, his work 
didn’t belong to him, it belonged to ‘the family,’ and they owed him nothing in return, and the only 
claim he had on them was his ‘need’ — so he had to beg in public for relief from his needs, like any 
lousy moocher, listing all his troubles and miseries, down to his patched drawers and his wife’s head 
colds, hoping that ‘the family’ would throw him the alms. He had to claim miseries, because it’s 
miseries, not work, that had become the coin of the realm — so it turned into a contest among six 
thousand panhandlers, each claiming that his need was worse than his brother’s. How else could it be 
done? Do you care to guess what happened, what sort of men kept quiet, feeling shame, and what sort 
got away with the jackpot? 

“But that wasn’t all. There was something else that we discovered at the same meeting. The 
factory’s production had fallen by forty per cent, in that first half-year, so it was decided that 
somebody hadn’t delivered ‘according to his ability.’ Who? How would you tell it? The family voted 
on that, too. They voted which men were the best, and these men were sentenced to work overtime 
each night for the next six months. Overtime without pay — because you weren’t paid by time and you 
weren’t paid by work, only by need. 

“Do I have to tell you what happened after that — and into what sort of creatures we all started 
turning, we who had once been human? We began to hide whatever ability we had, to slow down and 
watch like hawks that we never worked any faster or better than the next fellow. What else could we 
do, when we knew that if we did our best for ‘the family,’ it’s not thanks or rewards that we’d get, but 



punishment? We knew that for every stinker who’d ruin a batch of motors and cost the company 
money — either through his sloppiness, because he didn’t have to care, or through plain incompetence 
— it’s we who’d have to pay with our nights and our Sundays. So we did our best to be no good. 

“There was one young boy who started out, full of fire for the noble ideal, a bright kid without any 
schooling, but with a wonderful head on his shoulders. The first year, he figured out a work process 
that saved us thousands of man-hours. He gave it to ‘the family,’ didn’t ask anything for it, either, 
couldn’t ask, but that was all right with him. It was for the ideal, he said. But when he found himself 
voted as one of our ablest and sentenced to night work, because we hadn’t gotten enough from him, he 
shut his mouth and his brain. You can bet he didn’t come up with any ideas, the second year. 

“What was it they’d always told us about the vicious competition of the profit system, where men 
had to compete for who’d do a better job than his fellows? Vicious, wasn’t it? Well, they should have 
seen what it was like when we all had to compete with one another for who’d do the worst job 
possible. There’s no surer way to destroy a man than to force him into a spot where he has to aim at 
not doing his best, where he has to struggle to do a bad job, day after day. That will finish him 
quicker than drink or idleness or pulling stick-ups for a living. But there was nothing else for us to do 
except to fake unfitness. The one accusation we feared was to be suspected of ability. Ability was 
like a mortgage on you that you could never pay off. And what was there to work for? You knew that 
your basic pittance would be given to you anyway, whether you worked or not — your ‘housing and 
feeding allowance,’ it was called — and above that pittance, you had no chance to get anything, no 
matter how hard you tried. You couldn’t count on buying a new suit of clothes next year — they might 
give you a ‘clothing allowance’ or they might not, according to whether nobody broke a leg, needed 
an operation or gave birth to more babies. And if there wasn’t enough money for new suits for 
everybody, then you couldn’t get yours, either. 

“There was one man who’d worked hard all his life, because he’d always wanted to send his son 
through college. Well, the boy graduated from high school in the second year of the plan — but ‘the 
family’ wouldn’t give the father any ‘allowance’ for the college. They said his son couldn’t go to 
college, until we had enough to send everybody’s sons to college — and that we first had to send 
everybody’s children through high school, and we didn’t even have enough for that. The father died 
the following year, in a knife fight with somebody in a saloon, a fight over nothing in particular — such 
fights were beginning to happen among us all the time. 

“Then there was an old guy, a widower with no family, who had one hobby: phonograph records. I 
guess that was all he ever got out of life. In the old days, he used to skip meals just to buy himself 
some new recording of classical music. Well, they didn’t give him any ‘allowance’ for records 
— ‘personal luxury,’ they called it. But at that same meeting, Millie Bush, somebody’s daughter, a 
mean, ugly little eight-year-old, was voted a pair of gold braces for her buck teeth — this was 
‘medical need,’ because the staff psychologist had said that the poor girl would get an inferiority 
complex if her teeth weren’t straightened out. The old guy who loved music, turned to drink, instead. 
He got so you never saw him fully conscious any more. But it seems like there was one thing he 
couldn’t forget. One night, he came staggering down the street, saw Millie Bush, swung his fist and 
knocked all her teeth out. Every one of them. 

“Drink, of course, was what we all turned to, some more, some less. Don’t ask how we got the 
money for it. When all the decent pleasures are forbidden, there’s always ways to get the rotten ones. 
You don’t break into grocery stores after dark and you don’t pick your fellow’s pockets to buy 



classical symphonies or fishing tackle, but if it’s to get stinking drunk and forget — you do. Fishing 
tackle? Hunting guns? Snapshot cameras? Hobbies? There wasn’t any ‘amusement allowance’ for 
anybody. ‘Amusement’ was the first thing they dropped. Aren’t you always supposed to be ashamed to 
object when anybody asks you to give up anything, if it’s something that gave you pleasure? Even our 
‘tobacco allowance’ was cut to where we got two packs of cigarettes a month — and this, they told us, 
was because the money had to go into the babies’ milk fund. Babies was the only item of production 
that didn’t fall, but rose and kept on rising — because people had nothing else to do, I guess, and 
because they didn’t have to care, the baby wasn’t their burden, it was ‘the family’s.’ In fact, the best 
chance you had of getting a raise and breathing easier for a while was a ‘baby allowance.’ Either that, 
or a major disease. 

“It didn’t take us long to see how it all worked out. Any man who tried to play straight, had to 
refuse himself everything. He lost his taste for any pleasure, he hated to smoke a nickel’s worth of 
tobacco or chew a stick of gum, worrying whether somebody had more need for that nickel. He felt 
ashamed of every mouthful of food he swallowed, wondering whose weary nights of overtime had 
paid for it, knowing that his food was not his by right, miserably wishing to be cheated rather than to 
cheat, to be a sucker, but not a blood-sucker. He wouldn’t marry, he wouldn’t help his folks back 
home, he wouldn’t put an extra burden on ‘the family.’ Besides, if he still had some sort of sense of 
responsibility, he couldn’t marry or bring children into the world, when he could plan nothing, 
promise nothing, count on nothing. But the shiftless and the irresponsible had a field day of it. They 
bred babies, they got girls into trouble, they dragged in every worthless relative they had from all 
over the country, every unmarried pregnant sister, for an extra ‘disability allowance,’ they got more 
sicknesses than any doctor could disprove, they ruined their clothing, their furniture, their homes — 
what the hell, ‘the family’ was paying for it! They found more ways of getting in ‘need’ than the rest of 
us could ever imagine — they developed a special skill for it, which was the only ability they showed. 

“God help us, ma’am! Do you see what we saw? We saw that we’d been given a law to live by, a 
moral law, they called it, which punished those who observed it — for observing it. The more you 
tried to live up to it, the more you suffered; the more you cheated it, the bigger reward you got. Your 
honesty was like a tool left at the mercy of the next man’s dishonesty. The honest ones paid, the 
dishonest collected. The honest lost, the dishonest won. How long could men stay good under this sort 
of law of goodness? We were a pretty decent bunch of fellows when we started. There weren’t many 
chiselers among us. We knew our jobs and we were proud of it and we worked for the best factory in 
the country, where old man Starnes hired nothing but the pick of the country’s labor. Within one year 
under the new plan, there wasn’t an honest man left among us. That was the evil, the sort of hell- 
horror evil that preachers used to scare you with, but you never thought to see alive. Not that the plan 
encouraged a few bastards, but that it turned decent people into bastards, and there was nothing else 
that it could do — and it was called a moral ideal! 

“What was it we were supposed to want to work for? For the love of our brothers? What brothers? 
For the bums, the loafers, the moochers we saw all around us? And whether they were cheating or 
plain incompetent, whether they were unwilling or unable — what difference did that make to us? If 
we were tied for life to the level of their unfitness, faked or real, how long could we care to go on? 
We had no way of knowing their ability, we had no way of controlling their needs — all we knew was 
that we were beasts of burden struggling blindly in some sort of place that was half-hospital, half- 
stockyards — a place geared to nothing but disability, disaster, disease — beasts put there for the relief 



of whatever whoever chose to say was whichever’s need. 

“Love of our brothers? That’s when we learned to hate our brothers for the first time in our lives. 
We began to hate them for every meal they swallowed, for every small pleasure they enjoyed, for one 
man’s new shirt, for another’s wife’s hat, for an outing with their family, for a paint job on their house 
— it was taken from us, it was paid for by our privations, our denials, our hunger. We began to spy on 
one another, each hoping to catch the others lying about their needs, so as to cut their ‘allowance’ at 
the next meeting. We began to have stool pigeons who informed on people, who reported that 
somebody had bootlegged a turkey to his family on some Sunday — which he’d paid for by gambling, 
most likely. We began to meddle into one another’s lives. We provoked family quarrels, to get 
somebody’s relatives thrown out. Any time we saw a man starting to go steady with a girl, we made 
life miserable for him. We broke up many engagements. We didn’t want anyone to marry, we didn’t 
want any more dependents to feed. 

“In the old days, we used to celebrate if somebody had a baby, we used to chip in and help him out 
with the hospital bills, if he happened to be hard-pressed for the moment. Now, if a baby was born, 
we didn’t speak to the parents for weeks. Babies, to us, had become what locusts were to farmers. In 
the old days, we used to help a man if he had a bad illness in the family. Now — well, I’ll tell you 
about just one case. It was the mother of a man who had been with us for fifteen years. She was a 
kindly old lady, cheerful and wise, she knew us all by our first names and we all liked her — we used 
to like her. One day, she slipped on the cellar stairs and fell and broke her hip. We knew what that 
meant at her age. The staff doctor said that she’d have to be sent to a hospital in town, for expensive 
treatments that would take a long time. The old lady died the night before she was to leave for town. 
They never established the cause of death. No, I don’t know whether she was murdered. Nobody said 
that. Nobody would talk about it at all. All I know is that I — and that’s what I can’t forget! — I, too, 
had caught myself wishing that she would die. This — may God forgive us! — was the brotherhood, the 
security, the abundance that the plan was supposed to achieve for us! 

“Was there any reason why this sort of horror would ever be preached by anybody? Was there 
anybody who got any profit from it? There was. The Starnes heirs. I hope you’re not going to remind 
me that they’d sacrificed a fortune and turned the factory over to us as a gift. We were fooled by that 
one, too. Yes, they gave up the factory. But profit, ma’am, depends on what it is you’re after. And 
what the Starnes heirs were after, no money on earth could buy. Money is too clean and innocent for 
that. 

“Eric Starnes, the youngest — he was a jellyfish that didn’t have the guts to be after anything in 
particular. He got himself voted as Director of our Public Relations Department, which didn’t do 
anything, except that he had a staff for the not doing of anything, so he didn’t have to bother sticking 
around the office. The pay he got — well, I shouldn’t call it ‘pay,’ none of us was ‘paid’ — the alms 
voted to him was fairly modest, about ten times what I got, but that wasn’t riches. Eric didn’t care for 
money — he wouldn’t have known what to do with it. He spent his time hanging around among us, 
showing how chummy he was and democratic. He wanted to be loved, it seems. The way he went 
about it was to keep reminding us that he had given us the factory. We couldn’t stand him 

“Gerald Starnes was our Director of Production. We never learned just what the size of his rake- 
off — his alms — had been. It would have taken a staff of accountants to figure that out, and a staff of 
engineers to trace the way it was piped, directly or indirectly, into his office. None of it was 
supposed to be for him — it was all for company expenses. Gerald had three cars, four secretaries, 



five telephones, and he used to throw champagne and caviar parties that no tax-paying tycoon in the 
country could have afforded. He spent more money in one year than his father had earned in profits in 
the last two years of his life. We saw a hundred-pound stack — a hundred pounds, we weighed them — 
of magazines in Gerald’s office, full of stories about our factory and our noble plan, with big pictures 
of Gerald Starnes, calling him a great social crusader. Gerald liked to come into the shops at night, 
dressed in his formal clothes, flashing diamond cufflinks the size of a nickel and shaking cigar ashes 
all over. Any cheap show-off who’s got nothing to parade but his cash, is bad enough — except that he 
makes no bones about the cash being his, and you’re free to gape at him or not, as you wish, and 
mostly you don’t. But when a bastard like Gerald Starnes puts on an act and keeps spouting that he 
doesn’t care for material wealth, that he’s only serving ‘the family,’ that all the lushness is not for 
himself, but for our sake and for the common good, because it’s necessary to keep up the prestige of 
the company and of the noble plan in the eyes of the public — then that’s when you learn to hate the 
creature as you’ve never hated anything human. 

“But his sister Ivy was worse. She really did not care for material wealth. The alms she got was no 
bigger than ours, and she went about in scuffed, flat-heeled shoes and shirtwaists — just to show how 
selfless she was. She was our Director of Distribution. She was the lady in charge of our needs. She 
was the one who held us by the throat. Of course, distribution was supposed to be decided by voting 
— by the voice of the people. But when the people are six thousand howling voices, trying to decide 
without yardstick, rhyme or reason, when there are no rules to the game and each can demand 
anything, but has a right to nothing, when everybody holds power over everybody’s life except his 
own — then it turns out, as it did, that the voice of the people is Ivy Starnes. By the end of the second 
year, we dropped the pretense of the ‘family meetings’ — in the name of ‘production efficiency and 
time economy,’ one meeting used to take ten days — and all the petitions of need were simply sent to 
Miss Starnes’ office. No, not sent. They had to be recited to her in person by every petitioner. Then 
she made up a distribution list, which she read to us for our vote of approval at a meeting that lasted 
three-quarters of an hour. We voted approval. There was a ten-minute period on the agenda for 
discussion and objections. We made no objections. We knew better by that time. Nobody can divide a 
factory’s income among thousands of people, without some sort of a gauge to measure people’s value. 
Her gauge was bootlicking. Selfless? In her father’s time, all of his money wouldn’t have given him a 
chance to speak to his lousiest wiper and get away with it, as she spoke to our best skilled workers 
and their wives. She had pale eyes that looked fishy, cold and dead. And if you ever want to see pure 
evil, you should have seen the way her eyes glinted when she watched some man who’d talked back 
to her once and who’d just heard his name on the list of those getting nothing above basic pittance. 
And when you saw it, you saw the real motive of any person who’s ever preached the slogan: ‘From 
each according to his ability, to each according to his need.’ 

“This was the whole secret of it. At first, I kept wondering how it could be possible that the 
educated, the cultured, the famous men of the world could make a mistake of this size and preach, as 
righteousness, this sort of abomination — when five minutes of thought should have told them what 
would happen if somebody tried to practice what they preached. Now I know that they didn’t do it by 
any kind of mistake. Mistakes of this size are never made innocently. If men fall for some vicious 
piece of insanity, when they have no way to make it work and no possible reason to explain their 
choice — it’s because they have a reason that they do not wish to tell. And we weren’t so innocent 
either, when we voted for that plan at the first meeting. We didn’t do it just because we believed that 



the drippy old guff they spewed was good. We had another reason, but the guff helped us to hide it 
from our neighbors and from ourselves. The guff gave us a chance to pass off as virtue something that 
we’d be ashamed to admit otherwise. There wasn’t a man voting for it who didn’t think that under a 
setup of this kind he’d muscle in on the profits of the men abler than himself. There wasn’t a man rich 
and smart enough but that he didn’t think that somebody was richer and smarter, and this plan would 
give him a share of his better’s wealth and brain. But while he was thinking that he’d get unearned 
benefits from the men above, he forgot about the men below who’d get unearned benefits, too. He 
forgot about all his inferiors who’d rush to drain him just as he hoped to drain his superiors. The 
worker who liked the idea that his need entitled him to a limousine like his boss’s, forgot that every 
bum and beggar on earth would come howling that their need entitled them to an icebox like his own. 
That was our real motive when we voted — that was the truth of it — but we didn’t like to think it, so 
the less we liked it, the louder we yelled about our love for the common good. 

“Well, we got what we asked for. By the time we saw what it was that we’d asked for, it was too 
late. We were trapped, with no place to go. The best men among us left the factory in the first week of 
the plan. We lost our best engineers, superintendents, foremen and highest- skilled workers. A man of 
self-respect doesn’t turn into a milch cow for anybody. Some able fellows tried to stick it out, but 
they couldn’t take it for long. We kept losing our men, they kept escaping from the factory like from a 
pesthole — till we had nothing left except the men of need, but none of the men of ability. 

“And the few of us who were still any good, but stayed on, were only those who had been there too 
long. In the old days, nobody ever quit the Twentieth Century — and, somehow, we couldn’t make 
ourselves believe that it was gone. After a while, we couldn’t quit, because no other employer would 
have us — for which I can’t blame him. Nobody would deal with us in any way, no respectable person 
or firm. All the small shops, where we traded, started moving out of Starnesville fast — till we had 
nothing left but saloons, gambling joints and crooks who sold us trash at gouging prices. The alms we 
got kept falling, but the cost of our living went up. The list of the factory’s needy kept stretching, but 
the list of its customers shrank. There was less and less income to divide among more and more 
people. In the old days, it used to be said that the Twentieth Century Motor trademark was as good as 
the karat mark on gold. I don’t know what it was that the Starnes heirs thought, if they thought at all, 
but I suppose that like all social planners and like savages, they thought that this trademark was a 
magic stamp which did the trick by some sort of voodoo power and that it would keep them rich, as it 
had kept their father. Well, when our customers began to see that we never delivered an order on time 
and never put out a motor that didn’t have something wrong with it — the magic stamp began to work 
the other way around: people wouldn’t take a motor as a gift, if it was marked Twentieth Century. And 
it came to where our only customers were men who never paid and never meant to pay their bills. But 
Gerald Starnes, doped by his own publicity, got huffy and went around, with an air of moral 
superiority, demanding that businessmen place orders with us, not because our motors were good, but 
because we needed the orders so badly. 

“By that time, a village half-wit could see what generations of professors had pretended not to 
notice. What good would our need do to a power plant when its generators stopped because of our 
defective engines? What good would it do to a man caught on an operating table when the electric 
light went out? What good would it do to the passengers of a plane when its motor failed in mid-air? 
And if they bought our product, not because of its merit, but because of our need, would that be the 
good, the right, the moral thing to do for the owner of that power plant, the surgeon in that hospital, the 



maker of that plane? 

“Yet this was the moral law that the professors and leaders and thinkers had wanted to establish all 
over the earth. If this is what it did in a single small town where we all knew one another, do you care 
to think what it would do on a world scale? Do you care to imagine what it would be like, if you had 
to live and to work, when you’re tied to all the disasters and all the malingering of the globe? To 
work — and whenever any men failed anywhere, it’s you who would have to make up for it. To work 
— with no chance to rise, with your meals and your clothes and your home and your pleasure 
depending on any swindle, any famine, any pestilence anywhere on earth. To work — with no chance 
for an extra ration, till the Cambodians have been fed and the Patagonians have been sent through 
college. To work — on a blank check held by every creature born, by men whom you’ll never see, 
whose needs you’ll never know, whose ability or laziness or sloppiness or fraud you have no way to 
learn and no right to question — just to work and work and work — and leave it up to the Ivys and the 
Geralds of the world to decide whose stomach will consume the effort, the dreams and the days of 
your life. And this is the moral law to accept? This — a moral ideal? 

“Well, we tried it — and we learned. Our agony took four years, from our first meeting to our last, 
and it ended the only way it could end: in bankruptcy. At our last meeting, Ivy Starnes was the one 
who tried to brazen it out. She made a short, nasty, snippy little speech in which she said that the plan 
had failed because the rest of the country had not accepted it, that a single community could not 
succeed in the midst of a selfish, greedy world — and that the plan was a noble ideal, but human nature 
was not good enough for it. A young boy — the one who had been punished for giving us a useful idea 
in our first year — got up, as we all sat silent, and walked straight to Ivy Starnes on the platform. He 
said nothing. He spat in her face. That was the end of the noble plan and of the Twentieth Century.” 


THE FORGOTTEN MAN OF SOCIALIZED MEDICINE 


This is the explanation given by a distinguished brain surgeon of why he joined Galt’s strike. 

“I quit when medicine was placed under State control, some years ago,” said Dr. Hendricks. “Do 
you know what it takes to perform a brain operation? Do you know the kind of skill it demands, and 
the years of passionate, merciless, excruciating devotion that go to acquire that skill? That was what I 
would not place at the disposal of men whose sole qualification to rule me was their capacity to spout 
the fraudulent generalities that got them elected to the privilege of enforcing their wishes at the point 
of a gun. I would not let them dictate the purpose for which my years of study had been spent, or the 
conditions of my work, or my choice of patients, or the amount of my reward. I observed that in all 
the discussions that preceded the enslavement of medicine, men discussed everything — except the 
desires of the doctors. Men considered only the ‘welfare’ of the patients, with no thought for those 
who were to provide it. That a doctor should have any right, desire or choice in the matter, was 
regarded as irrelevant selfishness; his is not to choose, they said, only ‘to serve.’ That a man who’s 
willing to work under compulsion is too dangerous a brute to entrust with a job in the stockyards — 
never occurred to those who proposed to help the sick by making life impossible for the healthy. I 
have often wondered at the smugness with which people assert their right to enslave me, to control my 
work, to force my will, to violate my conscience, to stifle my mind — yet what is it that they expect to 



depend on, when they lie on an operating table under my hands? Their moral code has taught them to 
believe that it is safe to rely on the virtue of their victims. Well, that is the virtue I have withdrawn. 
Let them discover the kind of doctors that their system will now produce. Let them discover, in their 
operating rooms and hospital wards, that it is not safe to place their lives in the hands of a man whose 
life they have throttled. It is not safe, if he is the sort of man who resents it — and still less safe, if he 
is the sort who doesn’t.” 


THE NATURE OF AN ARTIST 


This is an excerpt from a conversation between Dagny Taggart, the heroine of the story, and 
Richard Halley, a great composer, who is now on strike. 

“Miss Taggart, how many people are there to whom my work means as much as it does to you? . . . 
That is the payment I demand. Not many can afford it. I don’t mean your enjoyment, I don’t mean your 
emotion — emotions be damned! — I mean your understanding and the fact that your enjoyment was of 
the same nature as mine, that it came from the same source: from your intelligence, from the conscious 
judgment of a mind able to judge my work by the standard of the same values that went to write it — I 
mean, not the fact that you felt, but that you felt what / wished you to feel, not the fact that you admire 
my work, but that you admire it for the things I wished to be admired. . . . There’s only one passion in 
most artists more violent than their desire for admiration: their fear of identifying the nature of such 
admiration as they do receive. But it’s a fear I’ve never shared. I do not fool myself about my work or 
the response I seek — I value both too highly. I do not care to be admired causelessly, emotionally, 
intuitively, instinctively — or blindly. I do not care for blindness in any form, I have too much to show 
— or for deafness, I have too much to say. I do not care to be admired by anyone’s heart — only by 
someone’s head. And when I find a customer with that invaluable capacity, then my performance is a 
mutual trade to mutual profit. An artist is a trader, Miss Taggart, the hardest and most exacting of all 
traders. . . . 

“Do you see why I’d give three dozen modern artists for one real businessman? . . . Whether it’s a 
symphony or a coal mine, all work is an act of creating and comes from the same source: from an 
inviolate capacity to see through one’s own eyes — which means: the capacity to perform a rational 
identification — which means: the capacity to see, to connect and to make what had not been seen, 
connected and made before. That shining vision which they talk about as belonging to the authors of 
symphonies and novels — what do they think is the driving faculty of men who discover how to use 
oil, how to run a mine, how to build an electric motor? That sacred fire which is said to burn within 
musicians and poets — what do they suppose moves an industrialist to defy the whole world for the 
sake of his new metal, as the inventors of the airplane, the builders of the railroads, the discoverers of 
new germs or new continents have done through all the ages? . . . An intransigent devotion to the 
pursuit of truth, Miss Taggart? Have you heard the moralists and the art lovers of the centuries talk 
about the artist’s intransigent devotion to the pursuit of truth? Name me a greater example of such 
devotion than the act of a man who says that the earth does turn, or the act of a man who says that an 
alloy of steel and copper has certain properties which enable it to do certain things, that it is and does 
— and let the world rack him or ruin him, he will not bear false witness to the evidence of his mind! 



This, Miss Taggart, this sort of spirit, courage and love for truth — as against a sloppy bum who goes 
around proudly assuring you that he has almost reached the perfection of a lunatic, because he’s an 
artist who hasn’t the faintest idea what his art work is or means, he’s not restrained by such crude 
concepts as ‘being’ or ‘meaning,’ he’s the vehicle of higher mysteries, he doesn’t know how he 
created his work or why, it just came out of him spontaneously, like vomit out of a drunkard, he did 
not think, he wouldn’t stoop to thinking, he just felt it, all he has to do is feel — he feels, the flabby, 
loose-mouthed, shifty-eyed, drooling, shivering, uncongealed bastard! I, who know what discipline, 
what effort, what tension of mind, what unrelenting strain upon one’s power of clarity are needed to 
produce a work of art — I, who know that it requires a labor which makes a chain gang look like rest 
and a severity no army-drilling sadist could impose — I’ll take the operator of a coal mine over any 
walking vehicle of higher mysteries. The operator knows that it’s not his feelings that keep the coal 
carts moving under the earth — and he knows what does keep them moving. Feelings? Oh yes, we do 
feel, he, you and I — we are, in fact, the only people capable of feeling — and we know where our 
feelings come from. But what we did not know and have delayed learning for too long is the nature of 
those who claim that they cannot account for their feelings. We did not know what it is that they feel. 
We are learning it now. It was a costly error. And those most guilty of it, will pay the hardest price — 
as, injustice, they must. Those most guilty of it were the real artists, who will now see that they are 
first to be exterminated and that they had prepared the triumph of their own exterminators by helping 
to destroy their only protectors. For if there is more tragic a fool than the businessman who doesn’t 
know that he’s an exponent of man’s highest creative spirit — it’s the artist who thinks that the 
businessman is his enemy.” 


“THIS IS JOHN GALT SPEAKING” 


This is the philosophy of Objectivism. 

“Ladies and gentlemen,” said a voice that came from the radio receiver — a man’s clear, calm, 
implacable voice, the kind of voice that had not been heard on the airwaves for years — “Mr. 
Thompson will not speak to you tonight. His time is up. I have taken it over. You were to hear a report 
on the world crisis. That is what you are going to hear. . . . 

“For twelve years, you have been asking: Who is John Galt? This is John Galt speaking. I am the 
man who loves his life. I am the man who does not sacrifice his love or his values. I am the man who 
has deprived you of victims and thus has destroyed your world, and if you wish to know why you are 
perishing — you who dread knowledge — I am the man who will now tell you. . . . 

“You have heard it said that this is an age of moral crisis. You have said it yourself, half in fear, 
half in hope that the words had no meaning. You have cried that man’s sins are destroying the world 
and you have cursed human nature for its unwillingness to practice the virtues you demanded. Since 
virtue, to you, consists of sacrifice, you have demanded more sacrifices at every successive disaster. 
In the name of a return to morality, you have sacrificed all those evils which you held as the cause of 
your plight. You have sacrificed justice to mercy. You have sacrificed independence to unity. You 
have sacrificed reason to faith. You have sacrificed wealth to need. You have sacrificed self-esteem 
to self-denial. You have sacrificed happiness to duty. 



“You have destroyed all that which you held to be evil and achieved all that which you held to be 
good. Why, then, do you shrink in horror from the sight of the world around you? That world is not the 
product of your sins, it is the product and the image of your virtues. It is your moral ideal brought into 
reality in its full and final perfection. You have fought for it, you have dreamed of it, you have wished 
it, and I — I am the man who has granted you your wish. 

“Your ideal had an implacable enemy, which your code of morality was designed to destroy. I have 
withdrawn that enemy. I have taken it out of your way and out of your reach. I have removed the 
source of all those evils you were sacrificing one by one. I have ended your battle. I have stopped 
your motor. I have deprived your world of man’s mind. 

“Men do not live by the mind, you say? I have withdrawn those who do. The mind is impotent, you 
say? I have withdrawn those whose mind isn’t. There are values higher than the mind, you say? I have 
withdrawn those for whom there aren’t. 

“While you were dragging to your sacrificial altars the men of justice, of independence, of reason, 
of wealth, of self-esteem — I beat you to it, I reached them first. I told them the nature of the game you 
were playing and the nature of that moral code of yours, which they had been too innocently generous 
to grasp. I showed them the way to live by another morality — mine. It is mine that they chose to 
follow. 

“All the men who have vanished, the men you hated, yet dreaded to lose, it is I who have taken 
them away from you. Do not attempt to find us. We do not choose to be found. Do not cry that it is our 
duty to serve you. We do not recognize such duty. Do not cry that you need us. We do not consider 
need a claim Do not cry that you own us. You don’t. Do not beg us to return. We are on strike, we, the 
men of the mind. 

“We are on strike against self-immolation. We are on strike against the creed of unearned rewards 
and unrewarded duties. We are on strike against the dogma that the pursuit of one’s happiness is evil. 
We are on strike against the doctrine that life is guilt. 

“There is a difference between our strike and all those you’ve practiced for centuries: our strike 
consists, not of making demands, but of granting them We are evil, according to your morality. We 
have chosen not to harm you any longer. We are useless, according to your economics. We have 
chosen not to exploit you any longer. We are dangerous and to be shackled, according to your politics. 
We have chosen not to endanger you, nor to wear the shackles any longer. We are only an illusion, 
according to your philosophy. We have chosen not to blind you any longer and have left you free to 
face reality — the reality you wanted, the world as you see it now, a world without mind. 

“We have granted you everything you demanded of us, we who had always been the givers, but 
have only now understood it. We have no demands to present to you, no terms to bargain about, no 
compromise to reach. You have nothing to offer us .We do not need you. 

“Are you now crying: No, this was not what you wanted? A mindless world of ruins was not your 
goal? You did not want us to leave you? You moral cannibals, I know that you’ve always known what 
it was that you wanted. But your game is up, because now we know it, too. 

“Through centuries of scourges and disasters, brought about by your code of morality, you have 
cried that your code had been broken, that the scourges were punishment for breaking it, that men 
were too weak and too selfish to spill all the blood it required. You damned man, you damned 
existence, you damned this earth, but never dared to question your code. Your victims took the blame 
and struggled on, with your curses as reward for their martyrdom — while you went on crying that 



your code was noble, but human nature was not good enough to practice it. And no one rose to ask the 
question: Good? — by what standard? 

“You wanted to know John Galt’s identity. I am the man who has asked that question. 

“Yes, this is an age of moral crisis. Yes, you are bearing punishment for your evil. But it is not man 
who is now on trial and it is not human nature that will take the blame. It is your moral code that’s 
through, this time. Your moral code has reached its climax, the blind alley at the end of its course. 
And if you wish to go on living, what you now need is not to return to morality — you who have never 
known any — but to discover it. 

“You have heard no concepts of morality but the mystical or the social. You have been taught that 
morality is a code of behavior imposed on you by whim, the whim of a supernatural power or the 
whim of society, to serve God’s purpose or your neighbor’s welfare, to please an authority beyond 
the grave or else next door — but not to serve your life or pleasure. Your pleasure, you have been 
taught, is to be found in immorality, your interests would best be served by evil, and any moral code 
must be designed not for you, but against you, not to further your life, but to drain it. 

“For centuries, the battle of morality was fought between those who claimed that your life belongs 
to God and those who claimed that it belongs to your neighbors — between those who preached that 
the good is self-sacrifice for the sake of ghosts in heaven and those who preached that the good is 
self-sacrifice for the sake of incompetents on earth. And no one came to say that your life belongs to 
you and that the good is to live it. 

“Both sides agreed that morality demands the surrender of your self-interest and of your mind, that 
the moral and the practical are opposites, that morality is not the province of reason, but the province 
of faith and force. Both sides agreed that no rational morality is possible, that there is no right or 
wrong in reason — that in reason there’s no reason to be moral. 

“Whatever else they fought about, it was against man’s mind that all your moralists have stood 
united. It was man’s mind that all their schemes and systems were intended to despoil and destroy. 
Now choose to perish or to learn that the anti-mind is the anti-life. 

“Man’s mind is his basic tool of survival. Life is given to him, survival is not. His body is given to 
him, its sustenance is not. His mind is given to him, its content is not. To remain alive, he must act, 
and before he can act he must know the nature and purpose of his action. He cannot obtain his food 
without a knowledge of food and of the way to obtain it. He cannot dig a ditch — or build a cyclotron 
— without a knowledge of his aim and of the means to achieve it. To remain alive, he must think. 

“But to think is an act of choice. The key to what you so recklessly call ‘human nature,’ the open 
secret you live with, yet dread to name, is the fact that man is a being of volitional consciousness. 
Reason does not work automatically; thinking is not a mechanical process; the connections of logic 
are not made by instinct. The function of your stomach, lungs or heart is automatic; the function of 
your mind is not. In any hour and issue of your life, you are free to think or to evade that effort. But 
you are not free to escape from your nature, from the fact that reason is your means of survival — so 
that for you, who are a human being, the question ‘to be or not to be’ is the question ‘to think or not to 
think.’ 

“A being of volitional consciousness has no automatic course of behavior. He needs a code of 
values to guide his actions. ‘Value’ is that which one acts to gain and keep, ‘virtue’ is the action by 
which one gains and keeps it. ‘Value’ presupposes an answer to the question: of value to whom and 
for what? ‘Value’ presupposes a standard, a purpose and the necessity of action in the face of an 



alternative. Where there are no alternatives, no values are possible. 

“There is only one fundamental alternative in the universe: existence or non-existence — and it 
pertains to a single class of entities: to living organisms. The existence of inanimate matter is 
unconditional, the existence of life is not: it depends on a specific course of action. Matter is 
indestructible, it changes its forms, but it cannot cease to exist. It is only a living organism that faces a 
constant alternative: the issue of life or death. Life is a process of self-sustaining and self-generated 
action. If an organism fails in that action, it dies; its chemical elements remain, but its life goes out of 
existence. It is only the concept of ‘Life’ that makes the concept of ‘Value’ possible. It is only to a 
living entity that things can be good or evil. 

“A plant must feed itself in order to live; the sunlight, the water, the chemicals it needs are the 
values its nature has set it to pursue; its life is the standard of value directing its actions. But a plant 
has no choice of action; there are alternatives in the conditions it encounters, but there is no 
alternative in its function: it acts automatically to further its life, it cannot act for its own destruction. 

“An animal is equipped for sustaining its life; its senses provide it with an automatic code of 
action, an automatic knowledge of what is good for it or evil. It has no power to extend its knowledge 
or to evade it. In conditions where its knowledge proves inadequate, it dies. But so long as it lives, it 
acts on its knowledge, with automatic safety and no power of choice, it is unable to ignore its own 
good, unable to decide to choose the evil and act as its own destroyer. 

“Man has no automatic code of survival. His particular distinction from all other living species is 
the necessity to act in the face of alternatives by means of volitional choice. He has no automatic 
knowledge of what is good for him or evil, what values his life depends on, what course of action it 
requires. Are you prattling about an instinct of self-preservation? An instinct of self-preservation is 
precisely what man does not possess. An ‘instinct’ is an unerring and automatic form of knowledge. A 
desire is not an instinct. A desire to live does not give you the knowledge required for living. And 
even man’s desire to live is not automatic: your secret evil today is that that is the desire you do not 
hold. Your fear of death is not a love for life and will not give you the knowledge needed to keep it. 
Man must obtain his knowledge and choose his actions by a process of thinking, which nature will not 
force him to perform. Man has the power to act as his own destroyer — and that is the way he has 
acted through most of his history. 

“A living entity that regarded its means of survival as evil, would not survive. A plant that 
struggled to mangle its roots, a bird that fought to break its wings would not remain for long in the 
existence they affronted. But the history of man has been a struggle to deny and to destroy his mind. 

“Man has been called a rational being, but rationality is a matter of choice — and the alternative his 
nature offers him is: rational being or suicidal animal. Man has to be man — by choice; he has to hold 
his life as a value — by choice; he has to learn to sustain it — by choice; he has to discover the values it 
requires and practice his virtues — by choice. 

“A code of values accepted by choice is a code of morality. 

“Whoever you are, you who are hearing me now, I am speaking to whatever living remnant is left 
uncorrupted within you, to the remnant of the human, to your mind, and I say: There is a morality of 
reason, a morality proper to man, and Man s Life is its standard of value. 

“All that which is proper to the life of a rational being is the good; all that which destroys it is the 
evil. 

“Man’s life, as required by his nature, is not the life of a mindless brute, of a looting thug or a 



mooching mystic, but the life of a thinking being — not life by means of force or fraud, but life by 
means of achievement — not survival at any price, since there’s only one price that pays for man’s 
survival: reason. 

“Man’s life is the standard of morality, but your own life is its purpose. If existence on earth is 
your goal, you must choose your actions and values by the standard of that which is proper to man — 
for the purpose of preserving, fulfilling and enjoying the irreplaceable value which is your life. 

“Since life requires a specific course of action, any other course will destroy it. A being who does 
not hold his own life as the motive and goal of his actions, is acting on the motive and standard of 
death. Such a being is a metaphysical monstrosity, struggling to oppose, negate and contradict the fact 
of his own existence, running blindly amuck on a trail of destruction, capable of nothing but pain. 

“Happiness is the successful state of life, pain is an agent of death. Happiness is that state of 
consciousness which proceeds from the achievement of one’s values. A morality that dares to tell you 
to find happiness in the renunciation of your happiness — to value the failure of your values — is an 
insolent negation of morality. A doctrine that gives you, as an ideal, the role of a sacrificial animal 
seeking slaughter on the altars of others, is giving you death as your standard. By the grace of reality 
and the nature of life, man — every man — is an end in himself, he exists for his own sake, and the 
achievement of his own happiness is his highest moral purpose. 

“But neither life nor happiness can be achieved by the pursuit of irrational whims. Just as man is 
free to attempt to survive in any random manner, but will perish unless he lives as his nature requires, 
so he is free to seek his happiness in any mindless fraud, but the torture of frustration is all he will 
find, unless he seeks the happiness proper to man. The purpose of morality is to teach you, not to 
suffer and die, but to enjoy yourself and live. 

“Sweep aside those parasites of subsidized classrooms, who live on the profits of the mind of 
others and proclaim that man needs no morality, no values, no code of behavior. They, who pose as 
scientists and claim that man is only an animal, do not grant him inclusion in the law of existence they 
have granted to the lowest of insects. They recognize that every living species has a way of survival 
demanded by its nature, they do not claim that a fish can live out of water or that a dog can live 
without its sense of smell — but man, they claim, the most complex of beings, man can survive in any 
way whatever, man has no identity, no nature, and there’s no practical reason why he cannot live with 
his means of survival destroyed, with his mind throttled and placed at the disposal of any orders they 
might care to issue. 

“Sweep aside those hatred-eaten mystics, who pose as friends of humanity and preach that the 
highest virtue man can practice is to hold his own life as of no value. Do they tell you that the purpose 
of morality is to curb man’s instinct of self-preservation? It is for the purpose of self-preservation that 
man needs a code of morality. The only man who desires to be moral is the man who desires to live. 

“No, you do not have to live; it is your basic act of choice; but if you choose to live, you must live 
as a man — by the work and the judgment of your mind. 

“No, you do not have to live as a man; it is an act of moral choice. But you cannot live as anything 
else — and the alternative is that state of living death which you now see within you and around you, 
the state of a thing unfit for existence, no longer human and less than animal, a thing that knows 
nothing but pain and drags itself through its span of years in the agony of unthinking self-destruction. 

“No, you do not have to think; it is an act of moral choice. But someone had to think to keep you 
alive; if you choose to default, you default on existence and you pass the deficit to some moral man, 



expecting him to sacrifice his good for the sake of letting you survive by your evil. 

“No, you do not have to be a man; but today those who are, are not there any longer. I have 
removed your means of survival — your victims. 

“If you wish to know how I have done it and what I told them to make them quit, you are hearing it 
now. I told them, in essence, the statement I am making tonight. They were men who had lived by my 
code, but had not known how great a virtue it represented. I made them see it. I brought them, not a re- 
evaluation, but only an identification of their values. 

“We, the men of the mind, are now on strike against you in the name of a single axiom, which is the 
root of our moral code, just as the root of yours is the wish to escape it: the axiom that existence 
exists. 

“Existence exists — and the act of grasping that statement implies two corollary axioms: that 
something exists which one perceives and that one exists possessing consciousness, consciousness 
being the faculty of perceiving that which exists. 

“If nothing exists, there can be no consciousness: a consciousness with nothing to be conscious of 
is a contradiction in terms. A consciousness conscious of nothing but itself is a contradiction in terms: 
before it could identify itself as consciousness, it had to be conscious of something. If that which you 
claim to perceive does not exist, what you possess is not consciousness. 

“Whatever the degree of your knowledge, these two — existence and consciousness — are axioms 
you cannot escape, these two are the irreducible primaries implied in any action you undertake, in any 
part of your knowledge and in its sum, from the first ray of light you perceive at the start of your life 
to the widest erudition you might acquire at its end. Whether you know the shape of a pebble or the 
structure of a solar system, the axioms remain the same: that it exists and that you know it. 

“To exist is to be something, as distinguished from the nothing of non-existence, it is to be an entity 
of a specific nature made of specific attributes. Centuries ago, the man who was — no matter what his 
errors — the greatest of your philosophers, has stated the formula defining the concept of existence and 
the rule of all knowledge: A is A. A thing is itself. You have never grasped the meaning of his 
statement. I am here to complete it: Existence is Identity, Consciousness is Identification. 

“Whatever you choose to consider, be it an object, an attribute or an action, the law of identity 
remains the same. A leaf cannot be a stone at the same time, it cannot be all red and all green at the 
same time, it cannot freeze and burn at the same time. A is A. Or, if you wish it stated in simpler 
language: You cannot have your cake and eat it, too. 

“Are you seeking to know what is wrong with the world? All the disasters that have wrecked your 
world, came from your leaders’ attempt to evade the fact that A is A. All the secret evil you dread to 
face within you and all the pain you have ever endured, came from your own attempt to evade the fact 
that A is A. The purpose of those who taught you to evade it, was to make you forget that Man is Man. 

“Man cannot survive except by gaining knowledge, and reason is his only means to gain it. Reason 
is the faculty that perceives, identifies and integrates the material provided by his senses. The task of 
his senses is to give him the evidence of existence, but the task of identifying it belongs to his reason, 
his senses tell him only that something is, but what it is must be learned by his mind. 

“All thinking is a process of identification and integration. Man perceives a blob of color; by 
integrating the evidence of his sight and his touch, he learns to identify it as a solid object; he learns 
to identify the object as a table; he learns that the table is made of wood; he learns that the wood 
consists of cells, that the cells consist of molecules, that the molecules consist of atoms. All through 



this process, the work of his mind consists of answers to a single question: What is it? His means to 
establish the truth of his answers is logic, and logic rests on the axiom that existence exists. Logic is 
the art of non-contradictory identification. A contradiction cannot exist. An atom is itself, and so is 
the universe; neither can contradict its own identity; nor can a part contradict the whole. No concept 
man forms is valid unless he integrates it without contradiction into the total sum of his knowledge. To 
arrive at a contradiction is to confess an error in one’s thinking; to maintain a contradiction is to 
abdicate one’s mind and to evict oneself from the realm of reality. 

“Reality is that which exists; the unreal does not exist; the unreal is merely that negation of 
existence which is the content of a human consciousness when it attempts to abandon reason. Truth is 
the recognition of reality; reason, man’s only means of knowledge, is his only standard of truth. 

“The most depraved sentence you can now utter is to ask: Whose reason? The answers is: Yours. 
No matter how vast your knowledge or how modest, it is your own mind that has to acquire it. It is 
only with your own knowledge that you can deal. It is only your own knowledge that you can claim to 
possess or ask others to consider. Your mind is your only judge of truth — and if others dissent from 
your verdict, reality is the court of final appeal. Nothing but a man’s mind can perform that complex, 
delicate, crucial process of identification which is thinking. Nothing can direct the process but his 
own judgment. Nothing can direct his judgment but his moral integrity. 

“You who speak of a ‘moral instinct’ as if it were some separate endowment opposed to reason — 
man’s reason is his moral faculty. A process of reason is a process of constant choice in answer to the 
question: True or False? — Right or Wrong? Is a seed to be planted in soil in order to grow — right or 
wrong? Is a man’s wound to be disinfected in order to save his life — right or wrong? Does the nature 
of atmospheric electricity permit it to be converted into kinetic power — right or wrong? It is the 
answers to such questions that gave you everything you have — and the answers came from a man’s 
mind, a mind of intransigent devotion to that which is right. 

“A rational process is a moral process. You may make an error at any step of it, with nothing to 
protect you but your own severity, or you may try to cheat, to fake the evidence and evade the effort of 
the quest — but if devotion to truth is the hallmark of morality, then there is no greater, nobler, more 
heroic form of devotion than the act of a man who assumes the responsibility of thinking. 

“That which you call your soul or spirit is your consciousness, and that which you call ‘free will’ 
is your mind’s freedom to think or not, the only will you have, your only freedom, the choice that 
controls all the choices you make and determines your life and your character. 

“Thinking is man’s only basic virtue, from which all the others proceed. And his basic vice, the 
source of all his evils, is that nameless act which all of you practice, but struggle never to admit: the 
act of blanking out, the willful suspension of one’s consciousness, the refusal to think — not blindness, 
but the refusal to see; not ignorance, but the refusal to know. It is the act of unfocusing your mind and 
inducing an inner fog to escape the responsibility of judgment — on the unstated premise that a thing 
will not exist if only you refuse to identify it, that A will not be A so long as you do not pronounce the 
verdict ‘It A.’ Non-thinking is an act of annihilation, a wish to negate existence, an attempt to wipe out 
reality. But existence exists; reality is not to be wiped out, it will merely wipe out the wiper. By 
refusing to say ‘It is,’ you are refusing to say ‘I am.’ By suspending your judgment, you are negating 
your person. When a man declares: ‘Who am I to know?’ — he is declaring: ‘Who am I to live?’ 

“This, in every hour and every issue, is your basic moral choice: thinking or non-thinking, 
existence or non-existence, A or non- A, entity or zero. 



“To the extent to which a man is rational, life is the premise directing his actions. To the extent to 
which he is irrational, the premise directing his actions is death. 

“You who prattle that morality is social and that man would need no morality on a desert island — it 
is on a desert island that he would need it most. Let him try to claim, when there are no victims to pay 
for it, that a rock is a house, that sand is clothing, that food will drop into his mouth without cause or 
effort, that he will collect a harvest tomorrow by devouring his stock seed today — and reality will 
wipe him out, as he deserves; reality will show him that life is a value to be bought and that thinking 
is the only coin noble enough to buy it. 

“If I were to speak your kind of language, I would say that man’s only moral commandment is: 
Thou shalt think. But a ‘moral commandment’ is a contradiction in terms. The moral is the chosen, not 
the forced; the understood, not the obeyed. The moral is the rational, and reason accepts no 
commandments. 

“My morality, the morality of reason, is contained in a single axiom: existence exists — and in a 
single choice: to live. The rest proceeds from these. To live, man must hold three things as the 
supreme and ruling values of his life: Reason — Purpose — Self-esteem. Reason, as his only tool of 
knowledge — Purpose, as his choice of the happiness which that tool must proceed to achieve — Self- 
esteem, as his inviolate certainty that his mind is competent to think and his person is worthy of 
happiness, which means: is worthy of living. These three values imply and require all of man’s 
virtues, and all his virtues pertain to the relation of existence and consciousness: rationality, 
independence, integrity, honesty, justice, productiveness, pride. 

“Rationality is the recognition of the fact that existence exists, that nothing can alter the truth and 
nothing can take precedence over that act of perceiving it, which is thinking — that the mind is one’s 
only judge of values and one’s only guide of action — that reason is an absolute that permits no 
compromise — that a concession to the irrational invalidates one’s consciousness and turns it from the 
task of perceiving to the task of faking reality — that the alleged short-cut to knowledge, which is faith, 
is only a short-circuit destroying the mind — that the acceptance of a mystical invention is a wish for 
the annihilation of existence and, properly, a nni hilates one’s consciousness. 

“Independence is the recognition of the fact that yours is the responsibility of judgment and nothing 
can help you escape it — that no substitute can do your thinking, as no pinch-hitter can live your life — 
that the vilest form of self-abasement and self-destruction is the subordination of your mind to the 
mind of another, the acceptance of an authority over your brain, the acceptance of his assertions as 
facts, his say-so as truth, his edicts as middle-man between your consciousness and your existence. 

“Integrity is the recognition of the fact that you cannot fake your consciousness, just as honesty is 
the recognition of the fact that you cannot fake existence — that man is an indivisible entity, an 
integrated unit of two attributes: of matter and consciousness, and that he may permit no breach 
between body and mind, between action and thought, between his life and his convictions — that, like 
a judge impervious to public opinion, he may not sacrifice his convictions to the wishes of others, be 
it the whole of mankind shouting pleas or threats against him — that courage and confidence are 
practical necessities, that courage is the practical form of being true to existence, of being true to 
truth, and confidence is the practical form of being true to one’s own consciousness. 

“Honesty is the recognition of the fact that the unreal is unreal and can have no value, that neither 
love nor fame nor cash is a value if obtained by fraud — that an attempt to gain a value by deceiving 
the mind of others is an act of raising your victims to a position higher than reality, where you become 



a pawn of their blindness, a slave of their non-thinking and their evasions, while their intelligence, 
their rationality, their perceptiveness become the enemies you have to dread and flee — that you do not 
care to live as a dependent, least of all a dependent on the stupidity of others, or as a fool whose 
source of values is the fools he succeeds in fooling — that honesty is not a social duty, not a sacrifice 
for the sake of others, but the most profoundly selfish virtue man can practice: his refusal to sacrifice 
the reality of his own existence to the deluded consciousness of others. 

“Justice is the recognition of the fact that you cannot fake the character of men as you cannot fake 
the character of nature, that you must judge all men as conscientiously as you judge inanimate objects, 
with the same respect for truth, with the same incorruptible vision, by as pure and as rational a 
process of identification — that every man must be judged for what he is and treated accordingly, that 
just as you do not pay a higher price for a rusty chunk of scrap than for a piece of shining metal, so 
you do not value a rotter above a hero — that your moral appraisal is the coin paying men for their 
virtues or vices, and this payment demands of you as scrupulous an honor as you bring to financial 
transactions — that to withhold your contempt from men’s vices is an act of moral counterfeiting, and 
to wit hho ld your admiration from their virtues is an act of moral embezzlement — that to place any 
other concern higher than justice is to devaluate your moral currency and defraud the good in favor of 
the evil, since only the good can lose by a default of justice and only the evil can profit — and that the 
bottom of the pit at the end of that road, the act of moral bankruptcy, is to punish men for their virtues 
and reward them for their vices, that that is the collapse to full depravity, the Black Mass of the 
worship of death, the dedication of your consciousness to the destruction of existence. 

“Productiveness is your acceptance of morality, your recognition of the fact that you choose to live 
— that productive work is the process by which man’s consciousness controls his existence, a 
constant process of acquiring knowledge and shaping matter to fit one’s purpose, of translating an 
idea into physical form, of remaking the earth in the image of one’s values — that all work is creative 
work if done by a thinking mind, and no work is creative if done by a blank who repeats in uncritical 
stupor a routine he has learned from others — that your work is yours to choose, and the choice is as 
wide as your mind, that nothing more is possible to you and nothing less is human — that to cheat your 
way into a job bigger than your mind can handle is to become a fear-corroded ape on borrowed 
motions and borrowed time, and to settle down into a job that requires less than your mind’s full 
capacity is to cut your motor and sentence yourself to another kind of motion: decay — that your work 
is the process of achieving your values, and to lose your ambition for values is to lose your ambition 
to live — that your body is a machine, but your mind is its driver, and you must drive as far as your 
mind will take you, with achievement as the goal of your road — that the man who has no purpose is a 
machine that coasts downhill at the mercy of any boulder to crash in the first chance ditch, that the 
man who stifles his mind is a stalled machine slowly going to rust, that the man who lets a leader 
prescribe his course is a wreck being towed to the scrap heap, and the man who makes another man 
his goal is a hitchhiker no driver should ever pick up — that your work is the purpose of your life, and 
you must speed past any killer who assumes the right to stop you, that any value you might find outside 
your work, any other loyalty or love, can be only travelers you choose to share your journey and must 
be travelers going on their own power in the same direction. 

“Pride is the recognition of the fact that you are your own highest value and, like all of man’s 
values, it has to be earned — that of any achievements open to you, the one that makes all others 
possible is the creation of your own character — that your character, your actions, your desires, your 



emotions are the products of the premises held by your mind — that as man must produce the physical 
values he needs to sustain his life, so he must acquire the values of character that make his life worth 
sustaining — that as man is a being of self-made wealth, so he is a being of self-made soul — that to 
live requires a sense of self- value, but man, who has no automatic values, has no automatic sense of 
self-esteem and must earn it by shaping his soul in the image of his moral ideal, in the image of Man, 
the rational being he is born able to create, but must create by choice — that the first precondition of 
self-esteem is that radiant selfishness of soul which desires the best in all things, in values of matter 
and spirit, a soul that seeks above all else to achieve its own moral perfection, valuing nothing higher 
than itself — and that the proof of an achieved self-esteem is your soul’s shudder of contempt and 
rebellion against the role of a sacrificial animal, against the vile impertinence of any creed that 
proposes to immolate the irreplaceable value which is your consciousness and the incomparable 
glory which is your existence to the blind evasions and the stagnant decay of others. 

“Are you beginning to see who is John Galt? I am the man who has earned the thing you did not 
fight for, the thing you have renounced, betrayed, corrupted, yet were unable fully to destroy and are 
now hiding as your guilty secret, spending your life in apologies to every professional cannibal, lest it 
be discovered that somewhere within you, you still long to say what I am now saying to the hearing of 
the whole of mankind: I am proud of my own value and of the fact that I wish to live. 

“This wish — which you share, yet submerge as an evil — is the only remnant of the good within you, 
but it is a wish one must learn to deserve. His own happiness is man’s only moral purpose, but only 
his own virtue can achieve it. Virtue is not an end in itself. Virtue is not its own reward or sacrificial 
fodder for the reward of evil. Life is the reward of virtue — and happiness is the goal and the reward 
of life. 

“Just as your body has two fundamental sensations, pleasure and pain, as signs of its welfare or 
injury, as a barometer of its basic alternative, life or death, so your consciousness has two 
fundamental emotions, joy and suffering, in answer to the same alternative. Your emotions are 
estimates of that which furthers your life or threatens it, lightning calculators giving you a sum of your 
profit or loss. You have no choice about your capacity to feel that something is good for you or evil, 
but what you will consider good or evil, what will give you joy or pain, what you will love or hate, 
desire or fear, depends on your standard of value. Emotions are inherent in your nature, but their 
content is dictated by your mind. Your emotional capacity is an empty motor, and your values are the 
fuel with which your mind fills it. If you choose a mix of contradictions, it will clog your motor, 
corrode your transmission and wreck you on your first attempt to move with a machine which you, the 
driver, have corrupted. 

“If you hold the irrational as your standard of value and the impossible as your concept of the good, 
if you long for rewards you have not earned, for a fortune or a love you don’t deserve, for a loophole 
in the law of causality, for an A that becomes non-A at your whim, if you desire the opposite of 
existence — you will reach it. Do not cry, when you reach it, that life is frustration and that happiness 
is impossible to man; check your fuel: it brought you where you wanted to go. 

“Happiness is not to be achieved at the command of emotional whims. Happiness is not the 
satisfaction of whatever irrational wishes you might blindly attempt to indulge. Happiness is a state of 
non-contradictory joy — a joy without penalty or guilt, a joy that does not clash with any of your 
values and does not work for your own destruction, not the joy of escaping from your mind, but of 
using your mind’s fullest power, not the joy of faking reality, but of achieving values that are real, not 



the joy of a drunkard, but of a producer. Happiness is possible only to a rational man, the man who 
desires nothing but rational goals, seeks nothing but rational values and finds his joy in nothing but 
rational actions. 

“Just as I support my life, neither by robbery nor alms, but by my own effort, so I do not seek to 
derive my happiness from the injury or the favor of others, but earn it by my own achievement. Just as 
I do not consider the pleasure of others as the goal of my life, so I do not consider my pleasure as the 
goal of the lives of others. Just as there are no contradictions in my values and no conflicts among my 
desires — so there are no victims and no conflicts of interest among rational men, men who do not 
desire the unearned and do not view one another with a ca nni bal’s lust, men who neither make 
sacrifices nor accept them. 

“The symbol of all relationships among such men, the moral symbol of respect for human beings, is 
the trader. We, who live by values, not by loot, are traders, both in matter and in spirit. A trader is a 
man who earns what he gets and does not give or take the undeserved. A trader does not ask to be 
paid for his failures, nor does he ask to be loved for his flaws. A trader does not squander his body as 
fodder or his soul as alms. Just as he does not give his work except in trade for material values, so he 
does not give the values of his spirit — his love, his friendship, his esteem — except inpayment and in 
trade for human virtues, in payment for his own selfish pleasure, which he receives from men he can 
respect. The mystic parasites who have, throughout the ages, reviled the traders and held them in 
contempt, while honoring the beggars and the looters, have known the secret motive of their sneers: a 
trader is the entity they dread — a man of justice. 

“Do you ask what moral obligation I owe to my fellow men? None — except the obligation I owe to 
myself, to material objects and to all of existence: rationality. I deal with men as my nature and theirs 
demands: by means of reason. I seek or desire nothing from them except such relations as they care to 
enter of their own voluntary choice. It is only with their mind that I can deal and only for my own self- 
interest, when they see that my interest coincides with theirs. When they don’t, I enter no relationship; 
I let dissenters go their way and I do not swerve from mine. I win by means of nothing but logic and I 
surrender to nothing but logic. I do not surrender my reason or deal with men who surrender theirs. I 
have nothing to gain from fools or cowards; I have no benefits to seek from human vices: from 
stupidity, dishonesty or fear. The only value men can offer me is the work of their mind. When I 
disagree with a rational man, I let reality be our final arbiter; if I am right, he will learn; if I am 
wrong, I will; one of us will win, but both will profit. 

“Whatever may be open to disagreement, there is one act of evil that may not, the act that no man 
may commit against others and no man may sanction or forgive. So long as men desire to live 
together, no man may initiate — do you hear me? no man may start — the use of physical force against 
others. 

“To interpose the threat of physical destruction between a man and his perception of reality, is to 
negate and paralyze his means of survival; to force him to act against his own judgment, is like 
forcing him to act against his own sight. Whoever, to whatever purpose or extent, initiates the use of 
force, is a killer acting on the premise of death in a manner wider than murder: the premise of 
destroying man’s capacity to live. 

“Do not open your mouth to tell me that your mind has convinced you of your right to force my 
mind. Force and mind are opposites; morality ends where a gun begins. When you declare that men 
are irrational animals and propose to treat them as such, you define thereby your own character and 



can no longer claim the sanction of reason — as no advocate of contradictions can claim it. There can 
be no ‘right’ to destroy the source of rights, the only means of judging right and wrong: the mind. 

“To force a man to drop his own mind and to accept your will as a substitute, with a gun in place of 
a syllogism, with terror in place of proof, and death as the final argument — is to attempt to exist in 
defiance of reality. Reality demands of man that he act for his own rational interest; your gun demands 
of him that he act against it. Reality threatens man with death if he does not act on his rational 
judgment; you threaten him with death if he does. You place him in a world where the price of his life 
is the surrender of all the virtues required by life — and death by a process of gradual destruction is 
all that you and your system will achieve, when death is made to be the ruling power, the winning 
argument in a society of men. 

“Be it a highwayman who co nfr onts a traveler with the ultimatum: ‘Your money or your life,’ or a 
politician who confronts a country with the ultimatum: ‘Your children’s education or your life,’ the 
meaning of that ultimatum is: ‘Your mind or your life’ — and neither is possible to man without the 
other. 

“If there are degrees of evil, it is hard to say who is the more contemptible: the brute who assumes 
the right to force the mind of others or the moral degenerate who grants to others the right to force his 
mind. That is the moral absolute one does not leave open to debate. I do not grant the terms of reason 
to men who propose to deprive me of reason. I do not enter discussions with neighbors who think they 
can forbid me to think. I do not place my moral sanction upon a murderer’s wish to kill me. When a 
man attempts to deal with me by force, I answer him — by force. 

“It is only as retaliation that force may be used and only against the man who starts its use. No, I do 
not share his evil or sink to his concept of morality: I merely grant him his choice, destruction, the 
only destruction he had the right to choose: his own. He uses force to seize a value; I use it only to 
destroy destruction. A holdup man seeks to gain wealth by killing me; I do not grow richer by killing a 
holdup man. I seek no values by means of evil, nor do I surrender my values to evil. 

“In the name of all the producers who had kept you alive and received your death ultimatums in 
payment, I now answer you with a single ultimatum of our own: Our work or your guns. You can 
choose either; you can’t have both. We do not initiate the use of force against others or submit to force 
at their hands. If you desire ever again to live in an industrial society, it will be on our moral terms. 
Our terms and our motive power are the antithesis of yours. You have been using fear as your weapon 
and have been bringing death to man as his punishment for rejecting your morality. We offer him life 
as his reward for accepting ours. 

“You who are worshippers of the zero — you have never discovered that achieving life is not the 
equivalent of avoiding death. Joy is not ‘the absence of pain,’ intelligence is not ‘the absence of 
stupidity,’ light is not ‘the absence of darkness,’ an entity is not ‘the absence of a nonentity.’ Building 
is not done by abstaining from demolition; centuries of sitting and waiting in such abstinence will not 
raise one single girder for you to abstain from demolishing — and now you can no longer say to me, 
the builder: ‘Produce, and feed us in exchange for our not destroying your production.’ I am 
answering in the name of all your victims: Perish with and in your own void. Existence is not a 
negation of negatives. Evil, not value, is an absence and a negation, evil is impotent and has no power 
but that which we let it extort from us. Perish, because we have learned that a zero cannot hold a 
mortgage over life. 

“You seek escape from pain. We seek the achievement of happiness. You exist for the sake of 



avoiding punishment. We exist for the sake of earning rewards. Threats will not make us function; fear 
is not our incentive. It is not death that we wish to avoid, but life that we wish to live. 

“You, who have lost the concept of the difference, you who claim that fear and joy are incentives of 
equal power — and secretly add that fear is the more ‘practical’ — you do not wish to live, and only 
fear of death still holds you to the existence you have damned. You dart in panic through the trap of 
your days, looking for the exit you have closed, running from a pursuer you dare not name to a terror 
you dare not acknowledge, and the greater your terror the greater your dread of the only act that could 
save you: thinking. The purpose of your struggle is not to know, not to grasp or name or hear the thing 
I shall now state to your hearing: that yours is the Morality of Death. 

“Death is the standard of your values, death is your chosen goal, and you have to keep running, 
since there is no escape from the pursuer who is out to destroy you or from the knowledge that that 
pursuer is yourself. Stop running, for once — there is no place to run — stand naked, as you dread to 
stand, but as I see you, and take a look at what you dared to call a moral code. 

“Damnation is the start of your morality, destruction is its purpose, means and end. Your code 
begins by damning man as evil, then demands that he practice a good which it defines as impossible 
for him to practice. It demands, as his first proof of virtue, that he accept his own depravity without 
proof. It demands that he start, not with a standard of value, but with a standard of evil, which is 
himself, by means of which he is then to define the good: the good is that which he is not. 

“It does not matter who then becomes the profiteer on his renounced glory and tormented soul, a 
mystic God with some incomprehensible design or any passer-by whose rotting sores are held as 
some inexplicable claim upon him — it does not matter, the good is not for him to understand, his duty 
is to crawl through years of penance, atoning for the guilt of his existence to any stray collector of 
unintelligible debts, his only concept of a value is a zero: the good is that which is non- man. 

“The name of this monstrous absurdity is Original Sin. 

“A sin without volition is a slap at morality and an insolent contradiction in terms: that which is 
outside the possibility of choice is outside the province of morality. If man is evil by birth, he has no 
will, no power to change it; if he has no will, he can be neither good nor evil; a robot is amoral. To 
hold, as man’s sin, a fact not open to his choice is a mockery of morality. To hold man’s nature as his 
sin is a mockery of nature. To punish him for a crime he committed before he was born is a mockery 
of justice. To hold him guilty in a matter where no innocence exists is a mockery of reason. To destroy 
morality, nature, justice and reason by means of a single concept is a feat of evil hardly to be 
matched. Yet that is the root of your code. 

“Do not hide behind the cowardly evasion that man is born with free will, but with a ‘tendency’ to 
evil. A free will saddled with a tendency is like a game with loaded dice. It forces man to struggle 
through the effort of playing, to bear responsibility and pay for the game, but the decision is weighted 
in favor of a tendency that he had no power to escape. If the tendency is of his choice, he cannot 
possess it at birth; if it is not of his choice, his will is not free. 

“What is the nature of the guilt that your teachers call his Original Sin? What are the evils man 
acquired when he fell from a state they consider perfection? Their myth declares that he ate the fruit 
of the tree of knowledge — he acquired a mind and became a rational being. It was the knowledge of 
good and evil — he became a moral being. He was sentenced to earn his bread by his labor — he 
became a productive being. He was sentenced to experience desire — he acquired the capacity of 
sexual enjoyment. The evils for which they damn him are reason, morality, creativeness, joy — all the 



cardinal values of his existence. It is not his vices that their myth of man’s fall is designed to explain 
and condemn, it is not his errors that they hold as his guilt, but the essence of his nature as man. 
Whatever he was — that robot in the Garden of Eden, who existed without mind, without values, 
without labor, without love — he was not man. 

“Man’s fall, according to your teachers, was that he gained the virtues required to live. These 
virtues, by their standard, are his Sin. His evil, they charge, is that he’s man. His guilt, they charge, is 
that he lives. 

“They call it a morality of mercy and a doctrine of love for man. 

“No, they say, they do not preach that man is evil, the evil is only that alien object: his body. No, 
they say, they do not wish to kill him, they only wish to make him lose his body. They seek to help 
him, they say, against his pain — and they point at the torture rack to which they’ve tied him, the rack 
with two wheels that pull him in opposite directions, the rack of the doctrine that splits his soul and 
body. 

“They have cut man in two, setting one half against the other. They have taught him that his body 
and his consciousness are two enemies engaged in deadly conflict, two antagonists of opposite 
natures, contradictory claims, incompatible needs, that to benefit one is to injure the other, that his 
soul belongs to a supernatural realm, but his body is an evil prison holding it in bondage to this earth 
— and that the good is to defeat his body, to undermine it by years of patient struggle, digging his way 
to that glorious jail-break which leads into the freedom of the grave. 

“They have taught man that he is a hopeless misfit made of two elements, both symbols of death. A 
body without a soul is a corpse, a soul without a body is a ghost — yet such is their image of man’s 
nature: the battleground of a struggle between a corpse and a ghost, a corpse endowed with some evil 
volition of its own and a ghost endowed with the knowledge that everything known to man is non- 
existent, that only the unknowable exists. 

“Do you observe what human faculty that doctrine was designed to ignore? It was man’s mind that 
had to be negated in order to make him fall apart. Once he surrendered reason, he was left at the 
mercy of two monsters whom he could not fathom or control: of a body moved by unaccountable 
instincts and a soul moved by mystic revelations — he was left as the passively ravaged victim of a 
battle between a robot and a dictaphone. 

“And as he now crawls through the wreckage, groping blindly for a way to live, your teachers offer 
him the help of a morality that proclaims that he’ll find no solution and must seek no fulfillment on 
earth. Real existence, they tell him, is that which he cannot perceive, true consciousness is the faculty 
of perceiving the non-existent — and if he is unable to understand it, that is the proof that his existence 
is evil and his consciousness impotent. 

“As products of the split between man’s soul and body, there are two kinds of teachers of the 
Morality of Death: the mystics of spirit and the mystics of muscle, whom you call the spiritualists and 
the materialists, those who believe in consciousness without existence and those who believe in 
existence without consciousness. Both demand the surrender of your mind, one to their revelations, 
the other to their reflexes. No matter how loudly they posture in the roles of irreconcilable 
antagonists, their moral codes are alike, and so are their aims: in matter — the enslavement of man’s 
body, in spirit — the destruction of his mind. 

“The good, say the mystics of spirit, is God, a being whose only definition is that he is beyond 
man’s power to conceive — a definition that invalidates man’s consciousness and nullifies his 



concepts of existence. The good, say the mystics of muscle, is Society — a thing which they define as 
an organism that possesses no physical form, a super-being embodied in no one in particular and 
everyone in general except yourself. Man’s mind, say the mystics of spirit, must be subordinated to 
the will of God. Man’s mind, say the mystics of muscle, must be subordinated to the will of Society. 
Man’s standard of value, say the mystics of spirit, is the pleasure of God, whose standards are beyond 
man’s power of comprehension and must be accepted on faith. Man’s standard of value, say the 
mystics of muscle, is the pleasure of Society, whose standards are beyond man’s right of judgment and 
must be obeyed as a primary absolute. The purpose of man’s life, say both, is to become an abject 
zombie who serves a purpose he does not know, for reasons he is not to question. His reward, say the 
mystics of spirit, will be given to him beyond the grave. His reward, say the mystics of muscle, will 
be given on earth — to his great-grandchildren. 

“ Selfishness — say both — is man’s evil. Man’s good — say both — is to give up his personal desires, 
to deny himself, renounce himself, surrender; man’s good is to negate the life he lives. Sacrifice — cry 
both — is the essence of morality, the highest virtue within man’s reach. 

“Whoever is now within reach of my voice, whoever is man the victim, not man the killer, I am 
speaking at the deathbed of your mind, at the brink of that darkness in which you’re drowning, and if 
there still remains within you the power to struggle to hold on to those fading sparks which had been 
yourself — use it now. The word that has destroyed you is ‘sacrifice. ’ Use the last of your strength to 
understand its meaning. You’re still alive. You have a chance. 



“‘Sacrifice’ does not mean the rejection of the worthless, but of the precious. ‘Sacrifice’ does not 
mean the rejection of the evil for the sake of the good, but of the good for the sake of the evil. 
‘ Sacrifice’ is the surrender of that which you value in favor of that which you don’t. 

“If you exchange a penny for a dollar, it is not a sacrifice; if you exchange a dollar for a penny, it 
is. If you achieve the career you wanted, after years of struggle, it is not a sacrifice; if you then 
renounce it for the sake of a rival, it is. If you own a bottle of milk and give it to your starving child, it 
is not a sacrifice; if you give it to your neighbor’s child and let your own die, it is. 

“If you give money to help a friend, it is not a sacrifice; if you give it to a worthless stranger, it is. 
If you give your friend a sum you can afford, it is not a sacrifice; if you give him money at the cost of 
your own discomfort, it is only a partial virtue, according to this sort of moral standard; if you give 
him money at the cost of disaster to yourself — that is the virtue of sacrifice in full. 

“If you renounce all personal desires and dedicate your life to those you love, you do not achieve 
full virtue: you still retain a value of your own, which is your love. If you devote your life to random 
strangers, it is an act of greater virtue. If you devote your life to serving men you hate — that is the 
greatest of the virtues you can practice. 

“A sacrifice is the surrender of a value. Full sacrifice is full surrender of all values. If you wish to 
achieve full virtue, you must seek no gratitude in return for your sacrifice, no praise, no love, no 
admiration, no self-esteem, not even the pride of being virtuous; the faintest trace of any gain dilutes 
your virtue. If you pursue a course of action that does not taint your life by any joy, that brings you no 
value in matter, no value in spirit, no gain, no profit, no reward — if you achieve this state of total 
zero, you have achieved the ideal of moral perfection. 

“You are told that moral perfection is impossible to man — and, by this standard, it is. You cannot 
achieve it so long as you live, but the value of your life and of your person is gauged by how closely 
you succeed in approaching that ideal zero which is death. 

“If you start, however, as a passionless blank, as a vegetable seeking to be eaten, with no values to 
reject and no wishes to renounce, you will not win the crown of sacrifice. It is not a sacrifice to 
renounce the unwanted. It is not a sacrifice to give your life for others, if death is your personal 
desire. To achieve the virtue of sacrifice, you must want to live, you must love it, you must burn with 
passion for this earth and for all the splendor it can give you — you must feel the twist of every knife 
as it slashes your desires away from your reach and drains your love out of your body. It is not mere 
death that the morality of sacrifice holds out to you as an ideal, but death by slow torture. 

“Do not remind me that it pertains only to this life on earth. I am concerned with no other. Neither 
are you. 

“If you wish to save the last of your dignity, do not call your best actions a ‘sacrifice’: that term 
brands you as immoral. If a mother buys food for her hungry child rather than a hat for herself, it is 
not a sacrifice: she values the child higher than the hat; but it is a sacrifice to the kind of mother 
whose higher value is the hat, who would prefer her child to starve and feeds him only from a sense 
of duty. If a man dies fighting for his own freedom, it is not a sacrifice: he is not willing to live as a 
slave; but it is a sacrifice to the kind of man who’s willing. If a man refuses to sell his convictions, it 
is not a sacrifice, unless he is the sort of man who has no convictions. 

“Sacrifice could be proper only for those who have nothing to sacrifice — no values, no standards, 
no judgment — those whose desires are irrational whims, blindly conceived and lightly surrendered. 
For a man of moral stature, whose desires are born of rational values, sacrifice is the surrender of the 



right to the wrong, of the good to the evil. 

“The creed of sacrifice is a morality for the immoral — a morality that declares its own bankruptcy 
by confessing that it can’t impart to men any personal stake in virtues or values, and that their souls 
are sewers of depravity, which they must be taught to sacrifice. By its own confession, it is impotent 
to teach men to be good and can only subject them to constant punishment. 

“Are you thinking, in some foggy stupor, that it’s only material values that your morality requires 
you to sacrifice? And what do you think are material values? Matter has no value except as a means 
for the satisfaction of human desires. Matter is only a tool of human values. To what service are you 
asked to give the material tools your virtue has produced? To the service of that which you regard as 
evil: to a principle you do not share, to a person you do not respect, to the achievement of a purpose 
opposed to your own — else your gift is not a sacrifice. 

“Your morality tells you to renounce the material world and to divorce your values from matter. A 
man whose values are given no expression in material form, whose existence is unrelated to his 
ideals, whose actions contradict his convictions, is a cheap little hypocrite — yet that is the man who 
obeys your morality and divorces his values from matter. The man who loves one woman, but sleeps 
with another — the man who admires the talent of a worker, but hires another — the man who considers 
one cause to be just, but donates his money to the support of another — the man who holds high 
standards of craftsmanship, but devotes his effort to the production of trash — these are the men who 
have renounced matter, the men who believe that the values of their spirit cannot be brought into 
material reality. 

“Do you say it is the spirit that such men have renounced? Yes, of course. You cannot have one 
without the other. You are an indivisible entity of matter and consciousness. Renounce your 
consciousness and you become a brute. Renounce your body and you become a fake. Renounce the 
material world and you surrender it to evil. 

“And that is precisely the goal of your morality, the duty that your code demands of you. Give to 
that which you do not enjoy, serve that which you do not admire, submit to that which you consider 
evil — surrender the world to the values of others, deny, reject, renounce your self. Your self is your 
mind; renounce it and you become a chunk of meat ready for any cannibal to swallow. 

“It is your mind that they want you to surrender — all those who preach the creed of sacrifice, 
whatever their tags or their motives, whether they demand it for the sake of your soul or of your body, 
whether they promise you another life in heaven or a lull stomach on this earth. Those who start by 
saying: ‘It is selfish to pursue your own wishes, you must sacrifice them to the wishes of others’ — end 
up by saying: ‘It is selfish to uphold your convictions, you must sacrifice them to the convictions of 
others.’ 

“This much is true: the most selfish of all things is the independent mind that recognizes no 
authority higher than its own and no value higher than its judgment of truth. You are asked to sacrifice 
your intellectual integrity, your logic, your reason, your standard of truth — in favor of becoming a 
prostitute whose standard is the greatest good for the greatest number. 

“If you search your code for guidance, for an answer to the question: ‘What is the good?’ — the only 
answer you will find is ‘The good of others. ’ The good is whatever others wish, whatever you feel 
they feel they wish, or whatever you feel they ought to feel. ‘The good of others’ is a magic formula 
that transforms anything into gold, a formula to be recited as a guarantee of moral glory and as a 
fiimi gator for any action, even the slaughter of a continent. Your standard of virtue is not an object, not 



an act, not a principle, but an intention. You need no proof, no reasons, no success, you need not 
achieve in fact the good of others — all you need to know is that your motive was the good of others, 
not your own. Your only definition of the good is a negation: the good is the ‘non-good for me.’ 

“Your code — which boasts that it upholds eternal, absolute, objective moral values and scorns the 
conditional, the relative and the subjective — your code hands out, as its version of the absolute, the 
following rule of moral conduct: If you wish it, it’s evil; if others wish it, it’s good; if the motive of 
your action is your welfare, don’t do it; if the motive is the welfare of others, then anything goes. 

“As this double-jointed, double- standard morality splits you in half, so it splits mankind into two 
enemy camps: one is you, the other is all the rest of humanity. You are the only outcast who has no 
right to wish or live. You are the only servant, the rest are the masters, you are the only giver, the rest 
are the takers, you are the eternal debtor, the rest are the creditors never to be paid off. You must not 
question their right to your sacrifice, or the nature of their wishes and their needs: their right is 
conferred upon them by a negative, by the fact that they are ‘non-you.’ 

“For those of you who might ask questions, your code provides a consolation prize and booby-trap: 
it is for your own happiness, it says, that you must serve the happiness of others, the only way to 
achieve your joy is to give it up to others, the only way to achieve your prosperity is to surrender your 
wealth to others, the only way to protect your life is to protect all men except yourself — and if you 
find no joy in this procedure, it is your own fault and the proof of your evil; if you were good, you 
would find your happiness in providing a banquet for others, and your dignity in existing on such 
crumbs as they might care to toss you. 

“You who have no standard of self-esteem, accept the guilt and dare not ask the questions. But you 
know the unadmitted answer, refusing to acknowledge what you see, what hidden premise moves your 
world. You know it, not in honest statement, but as a dark uneasiness within you, while you flounder 
between guiltily cheating and grudgingly practicing a principle too vicious to name. 

“I, who do not accept the unearned, neither in values nor in guilt, am here to ask the questions you 
evaded. Why is it moral to serve the happiness of others, but not your own? If enjoyment is a value, 
why is it moral when experienced by others, but immoral when experienced by you? If the sensation 
of eating a cake is a value, why is it an immoral indulgence in your stomach, but a moral goal for you 
to achieve in the stomach of others? Why is it immoral for you to desire, but moral for others to do 
so? Why is it immoral to produce a value and keep it, but moral to give it away? And if it is not moral 
for you to keep a value, why is it moral for others to accept it? If you are selfless and virtuous when 
you give it, are they not selfish and vicious when they take it? Does virtue consist of serving vice? Is 
the moral purpose of those who are good, self-immolation for the sake of those who are evil? 

“The answer you evade, the monstrous answer is: No, the takers are not evil, provided they did not 
earn the value you gave them. It is not immoral for them to accept it, provided they are unable to 
produce it, unable to deserve it, unable to give you any value in return. It is not immoral for them to 
enjoy it, provided they do not obtain it by right. 

“Such is the secret core of your creed, the other half of your double standard: it is immoral to live 
by your own effort, but moral to live by the effort of others — it is immoral to consume your own 
product, but moral to consume the products of others — it is immoral to earn, but moral to mooch — it 
is the parasites who are the moral justification for the existence of the producers, but the existence of 
the parasites is an end in itself — it is evil to profit by achievement, but good to profit by sacrifice — it 
is evil to create your own happiness, but good to enjoy it at the price of the blood of others. 



“Your code divides mankind into two castes and commands them to live by opposite rules: those 
who may desire anything and those who may desire nothing, the chosen and the damned, the riders and 
the carriers, the eaters and the eaten. What standard determines your caste? What passkey admits you 
to the moral elite? The passkey is lack of value. 

“Whatever the value involved, it is your lack of it that gives you a claim upon those who don’t lack 
it. It is your need that gives you a claim to rewards. If you are able to satisfy your need, your ability 
annuls your right to satisfy it. But a need you are unable to satisfy gives you first right to the lives of 
mankind. 

“If you succeed, any man who fails is your master; if you fail, any man who succeeds is your serf. 
Whether your failure is just or not, whether your wishes are rational or not, whether your misfortune 
is undeserved or the result of your vices, it is misfortune that gives you a right to rewards. It is pain, 
regardless of its nature or cause, pain as a primary absolute, that gives you a mortgage on all of 
existence. 

“If you heal your pain by your own effort, you receive no moral credit: your code regards it 
scornfully as an act of self-interest. Whatever value you seek to acquire, be it wealth or food or love 
or rights, if you acquire it by means of your virtue, your code does not regard it as a moral 
acquisition: you occasion no loss to anyone, it is a trade, not alms; a payment, not a sacrifice. The 
deserved belongs in the selfish, commercial realm of mutual profit; it is only the undeserved that calls 
for that moral transaction which consists of profit to one at the price of disaster to the other. To 
demand rewards for your virtue is selfish and immoral; it is your lack of virtue that transforms your 
demand into a moral right. 

“A morality that holds need as a claim, holds emptiness — non-existence — as its standard of value; 
it rewards an absence, a defect: weakness, inability, incompetence, suffering, disease, disaster, the 
lack, the fault, the flaw — the zero. 

“Who provides the account to pay these claims? Those who are cursed for being non- zeros, each to 
the extent of his distance from that ideal. Since all values are the product of virtues, the degree of 
your virtue is used as the measure of your penalty; the degree of your faults is used as the measure of 
your gain. Your code declares that the rational man must sacrifice himself to the irrational, the 
independent man to parasites, the honest man to the dishonest, the man of justice to the unjust, the 
productive man to thieving loafers, the man of integrity to compromising knaves, the man of self- 
esteem to sniveling neurotics. Do you wonder at the meanness of soul in those you see around you? 
The man who achieves these virtues will not accept your moral code; the man who accepts your 
moral code will not achieve these virtues. 

“Under a morality of sacrifice, the first value you sacrifice is morality; the next is self-esteem. 
When need is the standard, every man is both victim and parasite. As a victim, he must labor to fill 
the needs of others, leaving himself in the position of a parasite whose needs must be filled by others. 
He cannot approach his fellow men except in one of two disgraceful roles: he is both a beggar and a 
sucker. 

“You fear the man who has a dollar less than you, that dollar is rightfully his, he makes you feel 
like a moral defrauder. You hate the man who has a dollar more than you, that dollar is rightfully 
yours, he makes you feel that you are morally defrauded. The man below is a source of your guilt, the 
man above is a source of your frustration. You do not know what to surrender or demand, when to 
give and when to grab, what pleasure in life is rightfully yours and what debt is still unpaid to others 



— you struggle to evade, as ‘theory,’ the knowledge that by the moral standard you’ve accepted you 
are guilty every moment of your life, there is no mouthful of food you swallow that is not needed by 
someone somewhere on earth — and you give up the problem in blind resentment, you conclude that 
moral perfection is not to be achieved or desired, that you will muddle through by snatching as snatch 
can and by avoiding the eyes of the young, of those who look at you as if self-esteem were possible 
and they expected you to have it. Guilt is all that you retain within your soul — and so does every other 
man, as he goes past, avoiding your eyes. Do you wonder why your morality has not achieved 
brotherhood on earth or the good will of man to man? 

“The justification of sacrifice, that your morality pro-pounds, is more corrupt than the corruption it 
purports to justify. The motive of your sacrifice, it tells you, should be love — the love you ought to 
feel for every man. A morality that professes the belief that the values of the spirit are more precious 
than matter, a morality that teaches you to scorn a whore who gives her body indiscriminately to all 
men — this same morality demands that you surrender your soul to promiscuous love for all comers. 

“As there can be no causeless wealth, so there can be no causeless love or any sort of causeless 
emotion. An emotion is a response to a fact of reality, an estimate dictated by your standards. To love 
is to value. The man who tells you that it is possible to value without values, to love those whom you 
appraise as worthless, is the man who tells you that it is possible to grow rich by consuming without 
producing and that paper money is as valuable as gold. 

“Observe that he does not expect you to feel a causeless fear. When his kind get into power, they 
are expert at contriving means of terror, at giving you ample cause to feel the fear by which they 
desire to rule you. But when it comes to love, the highest of emotions, you permit them to shriek at 
you accusingly that you are a moral delinquent if you’re incapable of feeling causeless love. When a 
man feels fear without reason, you call him to the attention of a psychiatrist; you are not so careful to 
protect the meaning, the nature and the dignity of love. 

“Love is the expression of one’s values, the greatest reward you can earn for the moral qualities 
you have achieved in your character and person, the emotional price paid by one man for the joy he 
receives from the virtues of another. Your morality demands that you divorce your love from values 
and hand it down to any vagrant, not as response to his worth, but as response to his need, not as 
reward, but as alms, not as a payment for virtues, but as a blank check on vices. Your morality tells 
you that the purpose of love is to set you free of the bonds of morality, that love is superior to moral 
judgment, that true love transcends, forgives and survives every manner of evil in its object, and the 
greater the love the greater the depravity it permits to the loved. To love a man for his virtues is paltry 
and human, it tells you; to love him for his flaws is divine. To love those who are worthy of it is self- 
interest; to love the unworthy is sacrifice. You owe your love to those who don’t deserve it, and the 
less they deserve it, the more love you owe them — the more loathsome the object, the nobler your 
love — the more unfasti dious your love, the greater your virtue — and if you can bring your soul to the 
state of a dump heap that welcomes anything on equal terms, if you can cease to value moral values, 
you have achieved the state of moral perfection. 

“Such is your morality of sacrifice and such are the twin ideals it offers: to refashion the life of 
your body in the image of a human stockyard, and the life of your spirit in the image of a dump. 

“Such was your goal — and you’ve reached it. Why do you now moan complaints about man’s 
impotence and the futility of human aspirations? Because you were unable to prosper by seeking 
destruction? Because you were unable to find joy by worshipping pain? Because you were unable to 



live by holding death as your standard of value? 

“The degree of your ability to live was the degree to which you broke your moral code, yet you 
believe that those who preach it are friends of humanity, you damn yourself and dare not question 
their motives or their goals. Take a look at them now, when you face your last choice — and if you 
choose to perish, do so with full knowledge of how cheaply how small an enemy has claimed your 
life. 

“The mystics of both schools, who preach the creed of sacrifice, are germs that attack you through a 
single sore: your fear of relying on your mind. They tell you that they possess a means of knowledge 
higher than the mind, a mode of consciousness superior to reason — like a special pull with some 
bureaucrat of the universe who gives them secret tips withheld from others. The mystics of spirit 
declare that they possess an extra sense you lack: this special sixth sense consists of contradicting the 
whole of the knowledge of your five. The mystics of muscle do not bother to assert any claim to 
extrasensory perception: they merely declare that your senses are not valid, and that their wisdom 
consists of perceiving your blindness by some manner of unspecified means. Both kinds demand that 
you invalidate your own consciousness and surrender yourself into their power. They offer you, as 
proof of their superior knowledge, the fact that they assert the opposite of everything you know, and 
as proof of their superior ability to deal with existence, the fact that they lead you to misery, self- 
sacrifice, starvation, destruction. 

“They claim that they perceive a mode of being superior to your existence on this earth. The 
mystics of spirit call it ‘another dimension,’ which consists of denying dimensions. The mystics of 
muscle call it ‘the future,’ which consists of denying the present. To exist is to possess identity. What 
identity are they able to give to their superior realm? They keep telling you what it is not, but never 
tell you what it is. All their identifications consist of negating: God is that which no human mind can 
know, they say — and proceed to demand that you consider it knowledge — God is non-man, heaven is 
non-earth, soul is non-body, virtue is non-profit, A is non- A, perception is non-sensory, knowledge is 
non-reason. Their definitions are not acts of defining, but of wiping out. 

“It is only the metaphysics of a leech that would cling to the idea of a universe where a zero is a 
standard of identification. A leech would want to seek escape from the necessity to name its own 
nature — escape from the necessity to know that the substance on which it builds its private universe is 
blood. 

“What is the nature of that superior world to which they sacrifice the world that exists? The 
mystics of spirit curse matter, the mystics of muscle curse profit. The first wish men to profit by 
renouncing the earth, the second wish men to inherit the earth by renouncing all profit. Their non- 
material, non-profit worlds are realms where rivers run with milk and coffee, where wine spurts from 
rocks at their command, where pastry drops on them from clouds at the price of opening their mouth. 
On this material, profit-chasing earth, an enormous investment of virtue — of intelligence, integrity, 
energy, skill — is required to construct a railroad to carry them the distance of one mile; in their non- 
material, non-profit world, they travel from planet to planet at the cost of a wish. If an honest person 
asks them: ‘How?’ — they answer with righteous scorn that a ‘how’ is the concept of vulgar realists; 
the concept of superior spirits is ‘Somehow.’ On this earth restricted by matter and profit, rewards 
are achieved by thought; in a world set free of such restrictions rewards are achieved by wishing. 

“And that is the whole of their shabby secret. The secret of all their esoteric philosophies, of all 
their dialectics and super-senses, of their evasive eyes and snarling words, the secret for which they 



destroy civilization, language, industries and lives, the secret for which they pierce their own eyes 
and eardrums, grind out their senses, blank out their minds, the purpose for which they dissolve the 
absolutes of reason, logic, matter, existence, reality — is to erect upon that plastic fog a single holy 
absolute: their Wish. 

“The restriction they seek to escape is the law of identity. The freedom they seek is freedom from 
the fact that an A will remain an A, no matter what their tears or tantrums — that a river will not bring 
them milk, no matter what their hunger — that water will not run uphill, no matter what comforts they 
could gain if it did, and if they want to lift it to the roof of a skyscraper, they must do it by a process 
of thought and labor, in which the nature of an inch of pipeline counts, but their feelings do not — that 
their feelings are impotent to alter the course of a single speck of dust in space or the nature of any 
action they have committed. 

“Those who tell you that man is unable to perceive a reality undistorted by his senses, mean that 
they are unwilling to perceive a reality undistorted by their feelings. ‘Things as they are’ are things as 
perceived by your mind; divorce them from reason and they become ‘things as perceived by your 
wishes.’ 

“There is no honest revolt against reason — and when you accept any part of their creed, your 
motive is to get away with something your reason would not permit you to attempt. The freedom you 
seek is freedom from the fact that if you stole your wealth, you are a scoundrel, no matter how much 
you give to charity or how many prayers you recite — that if you sleep with sluts, you’re not a worthy 
husband, no matter how anxiously you feel that you love your wife next morning — that you are an 
entity, not a series of random pieces scattered through a universe where nothing sticks and nothing 
commits you to anything, the universe of a child’s nightmare where identities switch and swim, where 
the rotter and the hero are interchangeable parts arbitrarily assumed at will — that you are a man — that 
you are an entity — that you are. 

“No matter how eagerly you claim that the goal of your mystic wishing is a higher mode of life, the 
rebellion against identity is the wish for non-existence. The desire not to be anything is the desire not 
to be. 

“Your teachers, the mystics of both schools, have reversed causality in their consciousness, then 
strive to reverse it in existence. They take their emotions as a cause, and their mind as a passive 
effect. They make their emotions their tool for perceiving reality. They hold their desires as an 
irreducible primary, as a fact superseding all facts. An honest man does not desire until he has 
identified the object of his desire. He says: ‘It is, therefore I want it.’ They say: ‘I want it, therefore it 
is.’ 

“They want to cheat the axiom of existence and consciousness, they want their consciousness to be 
an instrument not of perceiving but of creating existence, and existence to be not the object but the 
subject of their consciousness — they want to be that God they created in their image and likeness, 
who creates a universe out of a void by means of an arbitrary whim. But reality is not to be cheated. 
What they achieve is the opposite of their desire. They want an omnipotent power over existence; 
instead, they lose the power of their consciousness. By refusing to know, they condemn themselves to 
the horror of a perpetual unknown. 

“Those irrational wishes that draw you to their creed, those emotions you worship as an idol, on 
whose altar you sacrifice the earth, that dark, incoherent passion within you, which you take as the 
voice of God or of your glands, is nothing more than the corpse of your mind. An emotion that clashes 



with your reason, an emotion that you cannot explain or control, is only the carcass of that stale 
thinking which you forbade your mind to revise. 

“Whenever you committed the evil of refusing to think and to see, of exempting from the absolute of 
reality some one small wish of yours, whenever you chose to say: Let me withdraw from the judgment 
of reason the cookies I stole, or the existence of God, let me have my one irrational whim and I will 
be a man of reason about all else — that was the act of subverting your consciousness, the act of 
corrupting your mind. Your mind then became a fixed jury who takes orders from a secret 
underworld, whose verdict distorts the evidence to fit an absolute it dares not touch — and a censored 
reality is the result, a splintered reality where the bits you chose to see are floating among the chasms 
of those you didn’t, held together by that embalming fluid of the mind which is an emotion exempted 
from thought. 

“The links you strive to drown are causal connections. The enemy you seek to defeat is the law of 
causality: it permits you no miracles. The law of causality is the law of identity applied to action. All 
actions are caused by entities. The nature of an action is caused and determined by the nature of the 
entities that act; a thing cannot act in contradiction to its nature. An action not caused by an entity 
would be caused by a zero, which would mean a zero controlling a thing, a non-entity controlling an 
entity, the non-existent ruling the existent — which is the universe of your teachers’ desire, the cause of 
their doctrines of causeless action, the reason of their revolt against reason, the goal of their morality, 
their politics, their economics, the ideal they strive for: the reign of the zero. 

“The law of identity does not permit you to have your cake and eat it, too. The law of causality 
does not permit you to eat your cake before you have it. But if you drown both laws in the blanks of 
your mind, if you pretend to yourself and to others that you don’t see — then you can try to proclaim 
your right to eat your cake today and mine tomorrow, you can preach that the way to have a cake is to 
eat it first, before you bake it, that the way to produce is to start by consuming, that all wishers have 
an equal claim to all things, since nothing is caused by anything. The corollary of the causeless in 
matter is the unearned in spirit. 

“Whenever you rebel against causality, your motive is the fraudulent desire, not to escape it, but 
worse: to reverse it. You want unearned love, as if love, the effect, could give you personal value, the 
cause — you want unearned admiration, as if admiration, the effect, could give you virtue, the cause — 
you want unearned wealth, as if wealth, the effect, could give you ability, the cause — you plead for 
mercy, mercy, not justice, as if an unearned forgiveness could wipe out the cause of your plea. And to 
indulge your ugly little shams, you support the doctrines of your teachers, while they run hog-wild 
proclaiming that spending, the effect, creates riches, the cause, that machinery, the effect, creates 
intelligence, the cause, that your sexual desires, the effect, create your philosophical values, the 
cause. 

“Who pays for the orgy? Who causes the causeless? Who are the victims, condemned to remain 
unacknowledged and to perish in silence, lest their agony disturb your pretense that they do not exist? 
We are, we, the men of the mind. 

“We are the cause of all the values that you covet, we who perform the process of thinking, which 
is the process of defining identity and discovering causal connections. We taught you to know, to 
speak, to produce, to desire, to love. You who abandon reason — were it not for us who preserve it, 
you would not be able to fulfill or even to conceive your wishes. You would not be able to desire the 
clothes that had not been made, the automobile that had not been invented, the money that had not been 



devised, as exchange for goods that did not exist, the admiration that had not been experienced for 
men who had achieved nothing, the love that belongs and pertains only to those who preserve their 
capacity to think, to choose, to value. 

“You — who leap like a savage out of the jungle of your feelings into the Fifth Avenue of our New 
York and proclaim that you want to keep the electric lights, but to destroy the generators — it is our 
wealth that you use while destroying us, it is our values that you use while damning us, it is our 
language that you use while denying the mind. 

“Just as your mystics of spirit invented their heaven in the image of our earth, omitting our 
existence, and promised you rewards created by miracle out of non-matter — so your modern mystics 
of muscle omit our existence and promise you a heaven where matter shapes itself of its own 
causeless will into all the rewards desired by your non-mind. 

“For centuries, the mystics of spirit had existed by running a protection racket — by making life on 
earth unbearable, then charging you for consolation and relief, by forbidding all the virtues that make 
existence possible, then riding on the shoulders of your guilt, by declaring production and joy to be 
sins, then collecting blackmail from the sinners. We, the men of the mind, were the unnamed victims 
of their creed, we who were willing to break their moral code and to bear damnation for the sin of 
reason — we who thought and acted, while they wished and prayed — we who were moral outcasts, we 
who were bootleggers of life when life was held to be a crime — while they basked in moral glory for 
the virtue of surpassing material greed and of distributing in selfless charity the material goods 
produced by — blank-out. 

‘Wow we are chained and commanded to produce by savages who do not grant us even the 
identification of sinners — by savages who proclaim that we do not exist, then threaten to deprive us 
of the life we don’t possess, if we fail to provide them with the goods we don’t produce. Now we are 
expected to continue running railroads and to know the minute when a train will arrive after crossing 
the span of a continent, we are expected to continue running steel mills and to know the molecular 
structure of every drop of metal in the cables of your bridges and in the body of the airplanes that 
support you in mid-air — while the tribes of your grotesque little mystics of muscle fight over the 
carcass of our world, gibbering in sounds of non-language that there are no principles, no absolutes, 
no knowledge, no mind. 

“Dropping below the level of a savage, who believes that the magic words he utters have the 
power to alter reality, they believe that reality can be altered by the power of the words they do not 
utter — and their magic tool is the blank-out, the pretense that nothing can come into existence past the 
voodoo of their refusal to identify it. 

“As they feed on stolen wealth in body, so they feed on stolen concepts in mind, and proclaim that 
honesty consists of refusing to know that one is stealing. As they use effects while denying causes, so 
they use our concepts while denying the roots and the existence of the concepts they are using. As they 
seek, not to build, but to take over industrial plants, so they seek, not to think, but to take over human 
thinking. 

“As they proclaim that the only requirement for running a factory is the ability to turn the cranks of 
the machines, and blank out the question of who created the factory — so they proclaim that there are 
no entities, that nothing exists but motion, and blank out the fact that motion presupposes the thing 
which moves, that without the concept of entity, there can be no such concept as ‘motion.’ As they 
proclaim their right to consume the unearned, and blank out the question of who’s to produce it — so 



they proclaim that there is no law of identity, that nothing exists but change, and blank out the fact that 
change presupposes the concepts of what changes, from what and to what, that without the law of 
identity no such concept as ‘change’ is possible. As they rob an industrialist while denying his value, 
so they seek to seize power over all of existence while denying that existence exists. 

“ ‘We know that we know nothing,’ they chatter, blanking out the fact that they are claiming 
knowledge — ‘There are no absolutes,’ they chatter, blanking out the fact that they are uttering an 
absolute — ‘You cannot prove that you exist or that you’re conscious,’ they chatter, blanking out the 
fact that proof presupposes existence, consciousness and a complex chain of knowledge: the existence 
of something to know, of a consciousness able to know it, and of a knowledge that has learned to 
distinguish between such concepts as the proved and the unproved. 

“When a savage who has not learned to speak declares that existence must be proved, he is asking 
you to prove it by means of non-existence — when he declares that your consciousness must be 
proved, he is asking you to prove it by means of unconsciousness — he is asking you to step into a 
void outside of existence and consciousness to give him proof of both — he is asking you to become a 
zero gaining knowledge about a zero. 

“When he declares that an axiom is a matter of arbitrary choice and he doesn’t choose to accept the 
axiom that he exists, he blanks out the fact that he has accepted it by uttering that sentence, that the 
only way to reject it is to shut one’s mouth, expound no theories and die. 

“An axiom is a statement that identifies the base of knowledge and of any further statement 
pertaining to that knowledge, a statement necessarily contained in all others, whether any particular 
speaker chooses to identify it or not. An axiom is a proposition that defeats its opponents by the fact 
that they have to accept it and use it in the process of any attempt to deny it. Let the caveman who 
does not choose to accept the axiom of identity, try to present his theory without using the concept of 
identity or any concept derived from it — let the anthropoid who does not choose to accept the 
existence of nouns, try to devise a language without nouns, adjectives or verbs — let the witch doctor 
who does not choose to accept the validity of sensory perception, try to prove it without using the 
data he obtained by sensory perception — let the head-hunter who does not choose to accept the 
validity of logic, try to prove it without using logic — let the pigmy who proclaims that a skyscraper 
needs no foundation after it reaches its fiftieth story, yank the base from under his building, not yours 
— let the cannibal who snarls that the freedom of man’s mind was needed to create an industrial 
civilization, but is not needed to maintain it, be given an arrowhead and bear-skin, not a university 
chair of economics. 

“Do you think they are taking you back to dark ages? They are taking you back to darker ages than 
any your history has known. Their goal is not the era of pre-science, but the era of pre-language. Their 
purpose is to deprive you of the concept on which man’s mind, his life and his culture depend: the 
concept of an objective reality. Identify the development of a human consciousness — and you will 
know the purpose of their creed. 

“A savage is a being who has not grasped that A is A and that reality is real. He has arrested his 
mind at the level of a baby’s, at the stage when a consciousness acquires its initial sensory 
perceptions and has not learned to distinguish solid objects. It is to a baby that the world appears as a 
blur of motion, without things that move — and the birth of his mind is the day when he grasps that the 
streak that keeps flickering past him is his mother and the whirl beyond her is a curtain, that the two 
are solid entities and neither can turn into the other, that they are what they are, that they exist. The 



day when he grasps that matter has no volition is the day when he grasps that he has — and this is his 
birth as a human being. The day when he grasps that the reflection he sees in a mirror is not a 
delusion, that it is real, but it is not himself, that the mirage he sees in a desert is not a delusion, that 
the air and the light rays that cause it are real, but it is not a city, it is a city’s reflection — the day 
when he grasps that he is not a passive recipient of the sensations of any given moment, that his senses 
do not provide him with automatic knowledge in separate snatches independent of context, but only 
with the material of knowledge, which his mind must learn to integrate — the day when he grasps that 
his senses cannot deceive him, that physical objects cannot act without causes, that his organs of 
perception are physical and have no volition, no power to invent or to distort, that the evidence they 
give him is an absolute, but his mind must learn to understand it, his mind must discover the nature, 
the causes, the full context of his sensory material, his mind must identify the things that he perceives 
— that is the day of his birth as a thinker and scientist. 

“We are the men who reach that day; you are the men who choose to reach it partly; a savage is a 
man who never does. 

“To a savage, the world is a place of unintelligible miracles where anything is possible to 
inanimate matter and nothing is possible to him. His world is not the unknown, but that irrational 
horror: the unknowable. He believes that physical objects are endowed with a mysterious volition, 
moved by causeless, unpredictable whims, while he is a helpless pawn at the mercy of forces beyond 
his control. He believes that nature is ruled by demons who possess an omnipotent power and that 
reality is their fluid plaything, where they can turn his bowl of meal into a snake and his wife into a 
beetle at any moment, where the A he has never discovered can be any non-A they choose, where the 
only knowledge he possesses is that he must not attempt to know. He can count on nothing, he can only 
wish, and he spends his life on wishing, on begging his demons to grant him his wishes by the 
arbitrary power of their will, giving them credit when they do, taking the blame when they don’t, 
offering them sacrifices in token of his gratitude and sacrifices in token of his guilt, crawling on his 
belly in fear and worship of sun and moon and wind and rain and of any thug who announces himself 
as their spokesman, provided his words are unintelligible and his mask sufficiently frightening — he 
wishes, begs and crawls, and dies, leaving you, as a record of his view of existence, the distorted 
monstrosities of his idols, part- man, part-animal, part-spider, the embodiments of the world of non-A. 

“His is the intellectual state of your modern teachers and his is the world to which they want to 
bring you. 

“If you wonder by what means they propose to do it, walk into any college classroom and you will 
hear your professors teaching your children that man can be certain of nothing, that his consciousness 
has no validity whatever, that he can learn no facts and no laws of existence, that he’s incapable of 
knowing an objective reality. What, then, is his standard of knowledge and truth? Whatever others 
believe, is their answer. There is no knowledge, they teach, there’s only faith : your belief that you 
exist is an act of faith, no more valid than another’s faith in his right to kill you; the axioms of science 
are an act of faith, no more valid than a mystic’s faith in revelations; the belief that electric light can 
be produced by a generator is an act of faith, no more valid than the belief that it can be produced by 
a rabbit’s foot kissed under a stepladder on the first of the moon — truth is whatever people want it to 
be, and people are everyone except yourself; reality is whatever people choose to say it is, there are 
no objective facts, there are only people’s arbitrary wishes — a man who seeks knowledge in a 
laboratory by means of test tubes and logic is an old-fashioned, superstitious fool; a true scientist is a 



man who goes around taking public polls — and if it weren’t for the selfish greed of the manufacturers 
of steel girders, who have a vested interest in obstructing the progress of science, you would learn 
that New York City does not exist, because a poll of the entire population of the world would tell you 
by a landslide majority that their beliefs forbid its existence. 

“For centuries, the mystics of spirit have proclaimed that faith is superior to reason, but have not 
dared deny the existence of reason. Their heirs and product, the mystics of muscle, have completed 
their job and achieved their dream: they proclaim that everything is faith, and call it a revolt against 
believing. As revolt against unproved assertions, they proclaim that nothing can be proved; as revolt 
against supernatural knowledge, they proclaim that no knowledge is possible; as revolt against the 
enemies of science, they proclaim that science is superstition; as revolt against the enslavement of the 
mind, they proclaim that there is no mind. 

“If you surrender your power to perceive, if you accept the switch of your standard from the 
objective to the collective and wait for mankind to tell you what to think, you will find another switch 
taking place before the eyes you have renounced: you will find that your teachers become the rulers of 
the collective, and if you then refuse to obey them, protesting that they are not the whole of mankind, 
they will answer: ‘By what means do you know that we are not? Are, brother? Where did you get that 
old-fashioned term?’ 

“If you doubt that such is their purpose, observe with what passionate consistency the mystics of 
muscle are striving to make you forget that a concept such as ‘mind’ has ever existed. Observe the 
twists of undefined verbiage, the words with rubber meanings, the terms left floating in midstream, by 
means of which they try to get around the recognition of the concept of ‘thinking. ’ Your 
consciousness, they tell you, consists of ‘reflexes,’ ‘reactions, ’ ‘experiences,’ ‘urges,’ and ‘drives’ — 
and refuse to identify the means by which they acquired that knowledge, to identify the act they are 
performing when they tell it or the act you are performing when you listen. Words have the power to 
‘condition’ you, they say and refuse to identify the reason why words have the power to change your 
— blank-out. A student reading a book understands it through a process of — blank-out. A scientist 
working on an invention is engaged in the activity of — blank-out. A psychologist helping a neurotic to 
solve a problem and untangle a conflict, does it by means of — blank-out. An industrialist — blank-out 
— there is no such person. A factory is a ‘natural resource,’ like a tree, a rock or a mud puddle. 

“The problem of production, they tell you, has been solved and deserves no study or concern; the 
only problem left for your ‘reflexes’ to solve is now the problem of distribution. Who solved the 
problem of production? Humanity, they answer. What was the solution? The goods are here. How did 
they get here? Somehow. What caused it? Nothing has causes. 

“They proclaim that every man born is entitled to exist without labor and, the laws of reality to the 
contrary notwithstanding, is entitled to receive his ‘minimum sustenance’ — his food, his clothes, his 
shelter — with no effort on his part, as his due and his birthright. To receive it — from whom? Blank- 
out. Every man, they announce, owns an equal share of the technological benefits created in the 
world. Created — by whom? Blank-out. Frantic cowards who posture as defenders of industrialists 
now define the purpose of economics as ‘an adjustment between the unlimited desires of men and the 
goods supplied in limited quantity.’ Supplied — by whom? Blank-out. Intellectual hoodlums who pose 
as professors, shrug away the thinkers of the past by declaring that their social theories were based on 
the impractical assumption that man was a rational being — but since men are not rational, they 
declare, there ought to be established a system that will make it possible for them to exist while being 



irrational, which means: while defying reality. Who will make it possible? Blank-out. Any stray 
mediocrity rushes into print with plans to control the production of mankind — and whoever agrees or 
disagrees with his statistics, no one questions his right to enforce his plans by means of a gun. Enforce 
— on whom? Blank-out. Random females with causeless incomes flitter on trips around the globe and 
return to deliver the message that the backward peoples of the world demand a higher standard of 
living. Demand — of whom? Blank-out. 

“And to forestall any inquiry into the cause of the difference between a jungle village and New 
York City, they resort to the ultimate obscenity of explaining man’s industrial progress — skyscrapers, 
cable bridges, power motors, railroad trains — by declaring that man is an animal who possesses an 
‘instinct of tool-making. ’ 

“Did you wonder what is wrong with the world? You are now seeing the climax of the creed of the 
uncaused and unearned. All your gangs of mystics, of spirit or muscle, are fighting one another for 
power to rule you, snarling that love is the solution for all the problems of your spirit and that a whip 
is the solution for all the problems of your body — you who have agreed to have no mind. Granting 
man less dignity than they grant to cattle, ignoring what an animal trainer could tell them — that no 
animal can be trained by fear, that a tortured elephant will trample its torturer, but will not work for 
him or carry his burdens — they expect man to continue to produce electronic tubes, supersonic 
airplanes, atom-smashing engines and interstellar telescopes, with his ration of meat for reward and a 
lash on his back for incentive. 

“Make no mistake about the character of mystics. To undercut your consciousness has always been 
their only purpose throughout the ages — and power, the power to rule you by force, has always been 
their only lust. 

“From the rites of the jungle witch doctors, which distorted reality into grotesque absurdities, 
stunted the minds of their victims and kept them in terror of the supernatural for stagnant stretches of 
centuries — to the supernatural doctrines of the Middle Ages, which kept men huddling on the mud 
floors of their hovels, in terror that the devil might steal the soup they had worked eighteen hours to 
earn — to the seedy little smiling professor who assures you that your brain has no capacity to think, 
that you have no means of perception and must blindly obey the omnipotent will of that supernatural 
force: Society — all of it is the same performance for the same and only purpose: to reduce you to the 
kind of pulp that has surrendered the validity of its consciousness. 

“But it cannot be done to you without your consent. If you permit it to be done, you deserve it. 

“When you listen to a mystic’s harangue on the impotence of the human mind and begin to doubt 
your consciousness, not his, when you permit your precariously semi-rational state to be shaken by 
any assertion and decide it is safer to trust his superior certainty and knowledge, the joke is on both of 
you: your sanction is the only source of certainty he has. The supernatural power that a mystic dreads, 
the unknowable spirit he worships, the consciousness he considers omnipotent is — yours. 

“A mystic is a man who surrendered his mind at its first encounter with the minds of others. 
Somewhere in the distant reaches of his childhood, when his own understanding of reality clashed 
with the assertions of others, with their arbitrary orders and contradictory demands, he gave in to so 
craven a fear of independence that he renounced his rational faculty. At the crossroads of the choice 
between ‘I know’ and ‘They say,’ he chose the authority of others, he chose to submit rather than to 
understand, to believe rather than to think. Faith in the supernatural begins as faith in the superiority of 
others. His surrender took the form of the feeling that he must hide his lack of understanding, that 



others possess some mysterious knowledge of which he alone is deprived, that reality is whatever 
they want it to be, through some means forever denied to him 

“From then on, afraid to think, he is left at the mercy of unidentified feelings. His feelings become 
his only guide, his only remnant of personal identity, he clings to them with ferocious possessiveness 
— and whatever thinking he does is devoted to the struggle of hiding from himself that the nature of his 
feelings is terror. 

“When a mystic declares that he feels the existence of a power superior to reason, he feels it all 
right, but that power is not an omniscient super-spirit of the universe, it is the consciousness of any 
passer-by to whom he has surrendered his own. A mystic is driven by the urge to impress, to cheat, to 
flatter, to deceive, to force that omnipotent consciousness of others. ‘They ’ are his only key to reality, 
he feels that he cannot exist save by harnessing their mysterious power and extorting their 
unaccountable consent. ‘They ’ are his only means of perception and, like a blind man who depends on 
the sight of a dog, he feels he must leash them in order to live. To control the consciousness of others 
becomes his only passion; power-lust is a weed that grows only in the vacant lots of an abandoned 
mind. 

“Every dictator is a mystic, and every mystic is a potential dictator. A mystic craves obedience 
from men, not their agreement. He wants them to surrender their consciousness to his assertions, his 
edicts, his wishes, his whims — as his consciousness is surrendered to theirs. He wants to deal with 
men by means of faith and force — he finds no satisfaction in their consent if he must earn it by means 
of facts and reason. Reason is the enemy he dreads and, simultaneously, considers precarious; reason, 
to him, is a means of deception; he feels that men possess some power more potent than reason — and 
only their causeless belief or their forced obedience can give him a sense of security, a proof that he 
has gained control of the mystic endowment he lacked. His lust is to command, not to convince: 
conviction requires an act of independence and rests on the absolute of an objective reality. What he 
seeks is power over reality and over men’s means of perceiving it, their mind, the power to interpose 
his will between existence and consciousness, as if, by agreeing to fake the reality he orders them to 
fake, men would, in fact, create it. 

“Just as the mystic is a parasite in matter, who expropriates the wealth created by others — just as 
he is a parasite in spirit, who plunders the ideas created by others — so he falls below the level of a 
lunatic who creates his own distortion of reality, to the level of a parasite of lunacy who seeks a 
distortion created by others. 

“There is only one state that fulfills the mystic’s longing for infinity, non-causality, non-identity: 
death. No matter what unintelligible causes he ascribes to his incommunicable feelings, whoever 
rejects reality rejects existence — and the feelings that move him from then on are hatred for all the 
values of man’s life, and lust for all the evils that destroy it. A mystic relishes the spectacle of 
suffering, of poverty, subservience and terror; these give him a feeling of triumph, a proof of the 
defeat of rational reality. But no other reality exists. 

“No matter whose welfare he professes to serve, be it the welfare of God or of that disembodied 
gargoyle he describes as ‘The People,’ no matter what ideal he proclaims in terms of some 
supernatural dimension — in fact, in reality, on earth, his ideal is death, his craving is to kill, his only 
satisfaction is to torture. 

“Destruction is the only end that the mystics’ creed has ever achieved as it is the only end that you 
see them achieving today, and if the ravages wrought by their acts have not made them question their 



doctrines, if they profess to be moved by love, yet are not deterred by piles of human corpses, it is 
because the truth about their souls is worse than the obscene excuse you have allowed them, the 
excuse that the end justifies the means and that the horrors they practice are means to nobler ends. The 
truth is that those horrors are their ends. 

“You who’re depraved enough to believe that you could adjust yourself to a mystic’s dictatorship 
and could please him by obeying his orders — there is no way to please him; when you obey, he will 
reverse his orders; he seeks obedience for the sake of obedience and destruction for the sake of 
destruction. You who are craven enough to believe that you can make terms with a mystic by giving in 
to his extortions — there is no way to buy him off, the bribe he wants is your life, as slowly or as fast 
as you are willing to give it in — and the monster he seeks to bribe is the hidden blank-out in his mind, 
which drives him to kill in order not to learn that the death he desires is his own. 

“You who are innocent enough to believe that the forces let loose in your world today are moved 
by greed for material plunder — the mystics’ scramble for spoils is only a screen to conceal from their 
mind the nature of their motive. Wealth is a means of human life, and they clamor for wealth in 
imitation of living beings, to pretend to themselves that they desire to live. But their swinish 
indulgence in plundered luxury is not enjoyment, it is escape. They do not want to own your fortune, 
they want you to lose it; they do not want to succeed, they want you to fail; they do not want to live, 
they want you to die; they desire nothing, they hate existence, and they keep running, each trying not to 
learn that the object of his hatred is himself. 

“You who’ve never grasped the nature of evil, you who describe them as ‘misguided idealists’ — 
may the God you invented forgive you ! — they are the essence of evil, they, those anti-living objects 
who seek, by devouring the world, to fill the selfless zero of their soul. It is not your wealth that 
they’re after. Theirs is a conspiracy against the mind, which means: against life and man. 

“It is a conspiracy without leader or direction, and the random little thugs of the moment who cash 
in on the agony of one land or another are chance scum riding the torrent from the broken dam of the 
sewer of centuries, from the reservoir of hatred for reason, for logic, for ability, for achievement, for 
joy, stored by every whining anti-human who ever preached the superiority of the ‘heart’ over the 
mind. 

“It is a conspiracy of all those who seek, not to live, but to get away with living, those who seek to 
cut just one small corner of reality and are drawn, by feeling, to all the others who are busy cutting 
other corners — a conspiracy that unites by links of evasion all those who pursue a zero as a value: the 
professor who, unable to think, takes pleasure in crippling the mind of his students, the businessman 
who, to protect his stagnation, takes pleasure in chaining the ability of competitors, the neurotic who, 
to defend his self-loathing, takes pleasure in breaking men of self-esteem, the incompetent who takes 
pleasure in defeating achievement, the mediocrity who takes pleasure in demolishing greatness, the 
eunuch who takes pleasure in the castration of all pleasure — and all their intellectual munition- 
makers, all those who preach that the immolation of virtue will transform vices into virtue. Death is 
the premise at the root of their theories, death is the goal of their actions in practice — and you are the 
last of their victims. 

“We, who were the living buffers between you and the nature of your creed, are no longer there to 
save you from the effects of your chosen beliefs. We are no longer willing to pay with our lives the 
debts you incurred in yours or the moral deficit piled up by all the generations behind you. You had 
been living on borrowed time — and I am the man who has called in the loan. 



“I am the man whose existence your blank-outs were intended to permit you to ignore. I am the man 
whom you did not want either to live or to die. You did not want me to live, because you were afraid 
of knowing that I carried the responsibility you dropped and that your lives depended upon me; you 
did not want me to die, because you knew it. 

“Twelve years ago, when I worked in your world, I was an inventor. I was one of a profession that 
came last in human history and will be first to vanish on the way back to the subhuman. An inventor is 
a man who asks ‘Why?’ of the universe and lets nothing stand between the answer and his mind. 

“Like the man who discovered the use of steam or the man who discovered the use of oil, I 
discovered a source of energy which was available since the birth of the globe, but which men had 
not known how to use except as an object of worship, of terror and of legends about a thundering god. 
I completed the experimental model of a motor that would have made a fortune for me and for those 
who had hired me, a motor that would have raised the efficiency of every human installation using 
power and would have added the gift of higher productivity to every hour you spend at earning your 
living. 

“Then, one night at a factory meeting, I heard myself sentenced to death by reason of my 
achievement. I heard three parasites assert that my brain and my life were their property, that my right 
to exist was conditional and depended on the satisfaction of their desires. The purpose of my ability, 
they said, was to serve the needs of those who were less able. I had no right to live, they said, by 
reason of my competence for living; their right to live was unconditional, by reason of their 
incompetence. 

“Then I saw what was wrong with the world, I saw what destroyed men and nations, and where the 
battle for life had to be fought. I saw that the enemy was an inverted morality — and that my sanction 
was its only power. I saw that evil was impotent — that evil was the irrational, the blind, the anti-real 
— and that the only weapon of its triumph was the willingness of the good to serve it. Just as the 
parasites around me were proclaiming their helpless dependence on my mind and were expecting me 
voluntarily to accept a slavery they had no power to enforce, just as they were counting on my self- 
immolation to provide them with the means of their plan — so throughout the world and throughout 
men’s history, in every version and form, from the extortions of loafing relatives to the atrocities of 
collectivized countries, it is the good, the able, the men of reason, who act as their own destroyers, 
who transfuse to evil the blood of their virtue and let evil transmit to them the poison of destruction, 
thus gaining for evil the power of survival, and for their own values — the impotence of death. I saw 
that there comes a point, in the defeat of any man of virtue, when his own consent is needed for evil to 
win — and that no manner of injury done to him by others can succeed if he chooses to withhold his 
consent. I saw that I could put an end to your outrages by pronouncing a single word in my mind. I 
pronounced it. The word was ‘No.’ 

“I quit that factory. I quit your world. I made it my job to warn your victims and to give them the 
method and the weapon to fight you. The method was to refuse to deflect retribution. The weapon was 
justice. 

“If you want to know what you lost when I quit and when my strikers deserted your world — stand 
on an empty stretch of soil in a wilderness unexplored by men and ask yourself what manner of 
survival you would achieve and how long you would last if you refused to think, with no one around 
to teach you the motions, or, if you chose to think, how much your mind would be able to discover — 
ask yourself how many independent conclusions you have reached in the course of your life and how 



much of your time was spent on performing the actions you learned from others — ask yourself 
whether you would be able to discover how to till the soil and grow your food, whether you would be 
able to invent a wheel, a lever, an induction coil, a generator, an electronic tube — then decide 
whether men of ability are exploiters who live by the fruit of your labor and rob you of the wealth 
that you produce, and whether you dare to believe that you possess the power to enslave them Let 
your women take a look at a jungle female with her shriveled face and pendulous breasts, as she sits 
grinding meal in a bowl, hour after hour, century by century — then let them ask themselves whether 
their ‘instinct of tool-making’ will provide them with their electric refrigerators, their washing 
machines and vacuum cleaners, and, if not, whether they care to destroy those who provided it all, but 
not ‘by instinct.’ 

“Take a look around you, you savages who stutter that ideas are created by men’s means of 
production, that a machine is not the product of human thought, but a mystical power that produces 
human thinking. You have never discovered the industrial age — and you cling to the morality of the 
barbarian eras when a miserable form of human subsistence was produced by the muscular labor of 
slaves. Every mystic had always longed for slaves, to protect him from the material reality he 
dreaded. But you, you grotesque little atavists, stare blindly at the skyscrapers and smokestacks 
around you and dream of enslaving the material providers who are scientists, inventors, industrialists. 
When you clamor for public ownership of the means of production, you are clamoring for public 
ownership of the mind. I have taught my strikers that the answer you deserve is only: ‘Try and get it.’ 

“You proclaim yourself unable to harness the forces of inanimate matter, yet propose to harness the 
minds of men who are able to achieve the feats you cannot equal. You proclaim that you cannot 
survive without us, yet propose to dictate the terms of our survival. You proclaim that you need us, yet 
indulge the impertinence of asserting your right to rule us by force — and expect that we, who are not 
afraid of that physical nature which fills you with terror, will cower at the sight of any lout who has 
talked you into voting him a chance to command us. 

“You propose to establish a social order based on the following tenets: that you’re incompetent to 
run your own life, but competent to run the lives of others — that you’re unfit to exist in freedom, but fit 
to become an omnipotent ruler — that you’re unable to earn your living by the use of your own 
intelligence, but able to judge politicians and to vote men into jobs of total power over arts you have 
never seen, over sciences you have never studied, over achievements of which you have no 
knowledge, over the gigantic industries where you, by your own definition of your capacity, would be 
unable successfully to fill the job of assistant greaser. 

“This idol of your cult of zero-worship, this symbol of impotence — the congenital dependent — is 
your image of man and your standard of value, in whose likeness you strive to refashion your soul. 
‘It’s only human,’ you cry in defense of any depravity, reaching the stage of self-abasement where you 
seek to make the concept ‘human ’ mean the weakling, the fool, the rotter, the liar, the failure, the 
coward, the fraud, and to exile from the human race the hero, the thinker, the producer, the inventor, 
the strong, the purposeful, the pure — as if ‘to feel’ were human, but to think were not, as if to fail 
were human, but to succeed were not, as if corruption were human, but virtue were not — as if the 
premise of death were proper to man, but the premise of life were not. 

“In order to deprive us of honor, that you may then deprive us of our wealth, you have always 
regarded us as slaves who deserve no moral recognition. You praise any venture that claims to be 
non-profit, and damn the men who made the profits that make the venture possible. You regard as ‘in 



the public interest’ any project serving those who do not pay; it is not in the public interest to provide 
any services for those who do the paying. ‘Public benefit’ is anything given as alms; to engage in trade 
is to injure the public. ‘Public welfare’ is the welfare of those who do not earn it; those who do, are 
entitled to no welfare. ‘The public, ’ to you, is whoever has failed to achieve any virtue or value; 
whoever achieves it, whoever provides the goods you require for survival, ceases to be regarded as 
part of the public or as part of the human race. 

“What blank-out permitted you to hope that you could get away with this muck of contradictions 
and to plan it as an ideal society, when the ‘No’ of your victims was sufficient to demolish the whole 
of your structure? What permits any insolent beggar to wave his sores in the face of his betters and to 
plead for help in the tone of a threat? You cry, as he does, that you are counting on our pity, but your 
secret hope is the moral code that has taught you to count on our guilt. You expect us to feel guilty of 
our virtues in the presence of your vices, wounds and failures — guilty of succeeding at existence, 
guilty of enjoying the life that you damn, yet beg us to help you to live. 

“Did you want to know who is John Galt? I am the first man of ability who refused to regard it as 
guilt. I am the first man who would not do penance for my virtues or let them be used as the tools of 
my destruction. I am the first man who would not suffer martyrdom at the hands of those who wished 
me to perish for the privilege of keeping them alive. I am the first man who told them that I did not 
need them, and until they learned to deal with me as traders, giving value for value, they would have 
to exist without me, as I would exist without them; then I would let them learn whose is the need and 
whose the ability — and if human survival is the standard, whose terms would set the way to survive. 

“I have done by plan and intention what had been done throughout history by silent default. There 
have always been men of intelligence who went on strike, in protest and despair, but they did not 
know the meaning of their action. The man who retires from public life, to think, but not to share his 
thoughts — the man who chooses to spend his years in the obscurity of menial employment, keeping to 
himself the fire of his mind, never giving it form, expression or reality, refusing to bring it into a 
world he despises — the man who is defeated by revulsion, the man who renounces before he has 
started, the man who gives up rather than give in, the man who functions at a fraction of his capacity, 
disarmed by his longing for an ideal he has not found — they are on strike, on strike against unreason, 
on strike against your world and your values. But not knowing any values of their own, they 
abandoned the quest to know — in the darkness of their hopeless indignation, which is righteous 
without knowledge of the right, and passionate without knowledge of desire, they concede to you the 
power of reality and surrender the incentives of their mind — and they perish in bitter futility, as rebels 
who never learned the object of their rebellion, as lovers who never discovered their love. 

“The infamous times you call the Dark Ages were an era of intelligence on strike, when men of 
ability went underground and lived undiscovered, studying in secret, and died, destroying the works 
of their mind, when only a few of the bravest of martyrs remained to keep the human race alive. Every 
period ruled by mystics was an era of stagnation and want, when most men were on strike against 
existence, working for less than their barest survival, leaving nothing but scraps for their rulers to 
loot, refusing to think, to venture, to produce, when the ultimate collector of their profits and the final 
authority on truth or error was the whim of some gilded degenerate sanctioned as superior to reason 
by divine right and by grace of a club. The road of human history was a string of blank-outs over 
sterile stretches eroded by faith and force, with only a few brief bursts of sunlight, when the released 
energy of the men of the mind performed the wonders you gaped at, admired and promptly 



extinguished again. 

“But there will be no extinction, this time. The game of the mystics is up. You will perish in and by 
your own unreality. We, the men of reason, will survive. 

“I have called out on strike the kind of martyrs who had never deserted you before. I have given 
them the weapon they had lacked: the knowledge of their own moral value. I have taught them that the 
world is ours, whenever we choose to claim it, by virtue and grace of the fact that ours is the 
Morality of Life. They, the great victims who had produced all the wonders of humanity’s brief 
summer, they, the industrialists, the conquerors of matter, had not discovered the nature of their right. 
They had known that theirs was the power. I taught them that theirs was the glory. 

“You, who dare to regard us as the moral inferiors of any mystic who claims supernatural visions 
— you, who scramble like vultures for plundered pennies, yet honor a fortune-teller above a fortune- 
maker — you, who scorn a businessman as ignoble, but esteem any posturing artist as exalted — the 
root of your standards is that mystic miasma which comes from primordial swamps, that cult of death, 
which pronounces a businessman immoral by reason of the fact that he keeps you alive. You, who 
claim that you long to rise above the crude concerns of the body, above the drudgery of serving mere 
physical needs — who is enslaved by physical needs: the Hindu who labors from sunrise to sunset at 
the shafts of a hand-plow for a bowl of rice, or the American who is driving a tractor? Who is the 
conqueror of physical reality: the man who sleeps on a bed of nails or the man who sleeps on an 
inner-spring mattress? Which is the monument to the triumph of the human spirit over matter: the 
germ-eaten hovels on the shorelines of the Ganges or the Atlantic skyline of New York? 

“Unless you learn the answers to these questions — and learn to stand at reverent attention when you 
face the achievements of man’s mind — you will not stay much longer on this earth, which we love and 
will not permit you to damn. You will not sneak by with the rest of your lifespan. I have foreshortened 
the usual course of history and have let you discover the nature of the payment you had hoped to 
switch to the shoulders of others. It is the last of your own living power that will now be drained to 
provide the unearned for the worshippers and carriers of Death. Do not pretend that a malevolent 
reality defeated you — you were defeated by your own evasions. Do not pretend that you will perish 
for a noble ideal — you will perish as fodder for the haters of man. 

“But to those of you who still retain a remnant of the dignity and will to love one’s life, I am 
offering the chance to make a choice. Choose whether you wish to perish for a morality you have 
never believed or practiced. Pause on the brink of self-destruction and examine your values and your 
life. You had known how to take an inventory of your wealth. Now take an inventory of your mind. 

“Since childhood, you have been hiding the guilty secret that you feel no desire to be moral, no 
desire to seek self-immolation, that you dread and hate your code, but dare not say it even to yourself, 
that you’re devoid of those moral ‘instincts’ which others profess to feel. The less you felt, the louder 
you proclaimed your selfless love and servitude to others, in dread of ever letting them discover your 
own self, the self that you betrayed, the self that you kept in concealment, like a skeleton in the closet 
of your body. And they, who were at once your dupes and your deceivers, they listened and voiced 
their loud approval, in dread of ever letting you discover that they were harboring the same unspoken 
secret. Existence among you is a giant pretense, an act you all perform for one another, each feeling 
that he is the only guilty freak, each placing his moral authority in the unknowable known only to 
others, each faking the reality he feels they expect him to fake, none having the courage to break the 
vicious circle. 



“No matter what dishonorable compromise you’ve made with your impracticable creed, no matter 
what miserable balance, half-cynicism, half- superstition, you now manage to maintain, you still 
preserve the root, the lethal tenet: the belief that the moral and the practical are opposites. Since 
childhood, you have been running from the terror of a choice you have never dared frilly to identify: If 
the practical, whatever you must practice to exist, whatever works, succeeds, achieves your purpose, 
whatever brings you food and joy, whatever profits you, is evil — and if the good, the moral, is the 
impractical, whatever fails, destroys, frustrates, whatever injures you and brings you loss or pain — 
then your choice is to be moral or to live. 

“The sole result of that murderous doctrine was to remove morality from life. You grew up to 
believe that moral laws bear no relation to the job of living, except as an impediment and threat, that 
man’s existence is an amoral jungle where anything goes and anything works. And in that fog of 
switching definitions which descends upon a frozen mind, you have forgotten that the evils damned by 
your creed were the virtues required for living, and you have come to believe that actual evils are the 
practical means of existence. Forgetting that the impractical ‘good’ was self-sacrifice, you believe 
that self-esteem is impractical; forgetting that the practical ‘evil’ was production, you believe that 
robbery is practical. 

“Swinging like a helpless branch in the wind of an uncharted moral wilderness, you dare not fully 
to be evil or frilly to live. When you are honest, you feel the resentment of a sucker; when you cheat, 
you feel terror and shame. When you are happy, your joy is diluted by guilt; when you suffer, your 
pain is augmented by the feeling that pain is your natural state. You pity the men you admire, you 
believe they are doomed to fail; you envy the men you hate, you believe they are the masters of 
existence. You feel disarmed when you come up against a scoundrel: you believe that evil is bound to 
win, since the moral is the impotent, the impractical. 

“Morality, to you, is a phantom scarecrow made of duty, of boredom, of punishment, of pain, a 
cross-breed between the first schoolteacher of your past and the tax collector of your present, a 
scarecrow standing in a barren field, waving a stick to chase away your pleasures — and pleasure, to 
you, is a liquor-soggy brain, a mindless slut, the stupor of a moron who stakes his cash on some 
animal’s race, since pleasure cannot be moral. 

“If you identify your actual belief, you will find a triple damnation — of yourself, of life, of virtue — 
in the grotesque conclusion you have reached: you believe that morality is a necessary evil. 

“Do you wonder why you live without dignity, love without fire and die without resistance? Do 
you wonder why, wherever you look, you see nothing but unanswerable questions, why your life is 
torn by impossible conflicts, why you spend it straddling irrational fences to evade artificial choices, 
such as soul or body, mind or heart, security or freedom, private profit or public good? 

“Do you cry that you find no answers? By what means did you hope to find them? You reject your 
tool of perception — your mind — then complain that the universe is a mystery. You discard your key, 
then wail that all doors are locked against you. You start out in pursuit of the irrational, then damn 
existence for making no sense. 

“The fence you have been straddling for two hours — while hearing my words and seeking to 
escape them — is the coward’s formula contained in the sentence: ‘But we don’t have to go to 
extremes!’ The extreme you have always struggled to avoid is the recognition that reality is final, that 
A is A and that the truth is true. A moral code impossible to practice, a code that demands 
imperfection or death, has taught you to dissolve all ideas in fog, to permit no firm definitions, to 



regard any concept as approximate and any rule of conduct as elastic, to hedge on any principle, to 
compromise on any value, to take the middle of any road. By extorting your acceptance of 
supernatural absolutes, it has forced you to reject the absolute of nature. By making moral judgments 
impossible, it has made you incapable of rational judgment. A code that forbids you to cast the first 
stone, has forbidden you to admit the identity of stones and to know when or if you’re being stoned. 

“The man who refuses to judge, who neither agrees nor disagrees, who declares that there are no 
absolutes and believes that he escapes responsibility, is the man responsible for all the blood that is 
now spilled in the world. Reality is an absolute, existence is an absolute, a speck of dust is an 
absolute and so is a human life. Whether you live or die is an absolute. Whether you have a piece of 
bread or not, is an absolute. Whether you eat your bread or see it vanish into a looter’s stomach, is an 
absolute. 

“There are two sides to every issue: one side is right and the other is wrong, but the middle is 
always evil. The man who is wrong still retains some respect for truth, if only by accepting the 
responsibility of choice. But the man in the middle is the knave who blanks out the truth in order to 
pretend that no choice or values exist, who is willing to sit out the course of any battle, willing to 
cash in on the blood of the innocent or to crawl on his belly to the guilty, who dispenses justice by 
condemning both the robber and the robbed to jail, who solves conflicts by ordering the thinker and 
the fool to meet each other halfway. In any compromise between food and poison, it is only death that 
can win. In any compromise between good and evil, it is only evil that can profit. In that transfusion 
of blood which drains the good to feed the evil, the compromiser is the transmitting rubber tube. 

“You, who are half-rational, half-coward, have been playing a con game with reality, but the victim 
you have conned is yourself. When men reduce their virtues to the approximate, then evil acquires the 
force of an absolute, when loyalty to an unyielding purpose is dropped by the virtuous, it’s picked up 
by scoundrels — and you get the indecent spectacle of a cringing, bargaining, traitorous good and a 
self-righteously uncompromising evil. As you surrendered to the mystics of muscle when they told 
you that ignorance consists of claiming knowledge, so now you surrender to them when they shriek 
that immorality consists of pronouncing moral judgment. When they yell that it is selfish to be certain 
that you are right, you hasten to assure them that you’re certain of nothing. When they shout that it’s 
immoral to stand on your convictions, you assure them that you have no convictions whatever. When 
the thugs of Europe’s People’s States snarl that you are guilty of intolerance, because you don’t treat 
your desire to live and their desire to kill you as a difference of opinion — you cringe and hasten to 
assure them that you are not intolerant of any horror. When some barefoot bum in some pesthole of 
Asia yells at you: How dare you be rich — you apologize and beg him to be patient and promise him 
you’ll give it all away. 

“You have reached the blind alley of the treason you committed when you agreed that you had no 
right to exist. Once, you believed it was ‘only a compromise’: you conceded it was evil to live for 
yourself, but moral to live for the sake of your children. Then you conceded that it was selfish to live 
for your children, but moral to live for your community. Then you conceded that it was selfish to live 
for your community, but moral to live for your country. Now, you are letting this greatest of countries 
be devoured by any scum from any corner of the earth, while you concede that it is selfish to live for 
your country and that your moral duty is to live for the globe. A man who has no right to life, has no 
right to values and will not keep them. 

“At the end of your road of successive betrayals, stripped of weapons, of certainty, of honor, you 



commit your final act of treason and sign your petition of intellectual bankruptcy: while the muscle- 
mystics of the People’s States proclaim that they’re the champions of reason and science, you agree 
and hasten to proclaim that faith is your cardinal principle, that reason is on the side of your 
destroyers, but yours is the side of faith. To the struggling remnants of rational honesty in the twisted, 
bewildered minds of your children, you declare that you can offer no rational argument to support the 
ideas that created this country, that there is no rational justification for freedom, for property, for 
justice, for rights, that they rest on a mystical insight and can be accepted only on faith, that in reason 
and logic the enemy is right, but faith is superior to reason. You declare to your children that it is 
rational to loot, to torture, to enslave, to expropriate, to murder, but that they must resist the 
temptations of logic and stick to the discipline of remaining irrational — that skyscrapers, factories, 
radios, airplanes were the products of faith and mystic intuition, while famines, concentration camps 
and firing squads are the products of a reasonable manner of existence — that the industrial revolution 
was the revolt of the men of faith against that era of reason and logic which is known as the Middle 
Ages. Simultaneously, in the same breath, to the same child, you declare that the looters who rule the 
People’s States will surpass this country in material production, since they are the representatives of 
science, but that it’s evil to be concerned with physical wealth and that one must renounce material 
prosperity — you declare that the looters’ ideals are noble, but they do not mean them, while you do; 
that your purpose in fighting the looters is only to accomplish their aims, which they cannot 
accomplish, but you can; and that the way to fight them is to beat them to it and give one’s wealth 
away. Then you wonder why your children join the People’s thugs or become half-crazed delinquents, 
you wonder why the looters’ conquests keep creeping closer to your doors — and you blame it on 
human stupidity, declaring that the masses are impervious to reason. 

“You blank out the open, public spectacle of the looters’ fight against the mind, and the fact that 
their bloodiest horrors are unleashed to punish the crime of thinking. You blank out the fact that most 
mystics of muscle started out as mystics of spirit, that they keep switching from one to the other, that 
the men you call materialists and spiritualists are only two halves of the same dissected human, 
forever seeking completion, but seeking it by swinging from the destruction of the flesh to the 
destruction of the soul and vice versa — that they keep running from your colleges to the slave pens of 
Europe to an open collapse into the mystic muck of India, seeking any refuge against reality, any form 
of escape from the mind. 

“You blank it out and cling to your hypocrisy of ‘faith’ in order to blank out the knowledge that the 
looters have a stranglehold upon you, which consists of your moral code — that the looters are the 
final and consistent practitioners of the morality you’re half-obeying, half-evading — that they practice 
it the only way it can be practiced: by turning the earth into a sacrificial furnace — that your morality 
forbids you to oppose them in the only way they can be opposed: by refusing to become a sacrificial 
animal and proudly asserting your right to exist — that in order to fight them to the finish and with full 
rectitude, it is your morality that you have to reject. 

“You blank it out, because your self-esteem is tied to that mystic ‘unselfishness’ which you’ve 
never possessed or practiced, but spent so many years pretending to possess that the thought of 
denouncing it fills you with terror. No value is higher than self-esteem, but you’ve invested it in 
counterfeit securities — and now your morality has caught you in a trap where you are forced to 
protect your self-esteem by fighting for the creed of self-destruction. The grim joke is on you: that 
need of self-esteem, which you’re unable to explain or to define, belongs to my morality, not yours; 



it’s the objective token of my code, it is my proof within your own soul. 

“By a feeling he has not learned to identify, but has derived from his first awareness of existence, 
from his discovery that he has to make choices, man knows that his desperate need of self-esteem is a 
matter of life or death. As a being of volitional consciousness, he knows that he must know his own 
value in order to maintain his own life. He knows that he has to be right ; to be wrong in action means 
danger to his life; to be wrong in person, to be evil, means to be unfit for existence. 

“Every act of man’s life has to be willed; the mere act of obtaining or eating his food implies that 
the person he preserves is worthy of being preserved; every pleasure he seeks to enjoy implies that 
the person who seeks it is worthy of finding enjoyment. He has no choice about his need of self- 
esteem, his only choice is the standard by which to gauge it. And he makes his fatal error when he 
switches this gauge protecting his life into the service of his own destruction, when he chooses a 
standard contradicting existence and sets his self-esteem against reality. 

“Every form of causeless self-doubt, every feeling of inferiority and secret unworthiness is, in fact, 
man’s hidden dread of his inability to deal with existence. But the greater his terror, the more fiercely 
he clings to the murderous doctrines that choke him. No man can survive the moment of pronouncing 
himself irredeemably evil; should he do it, his next moment is insanity or suicide. To escape it — if 
he’s chosen an irrational standard — he will fake, evade, blank out; he will cheat himself of reality, of 
existence, of happiness, of mind; and he will ultimately cheat himself of self-esteem by struggling to 
preserve its illusion rather than to risk discovering its lack. To fear to face an issue is to believe that 
the worst is true. 

“It is not any crime you have ever committed that infects your soul with permanent guilt, it is none 
of your failures, errors or flaws, but the blank-out by which you attempt to evade them — it is not any 
sort of Original Sin or unknown prenatal deficiency, but the knowledge and fact of your basic default, 
of suspending your mind, of refusing to think. Fear and guilt are your chronic emotions, they are real 
and you do deserve them, but they don’t come from the superficial reasons you invent to disguise their 
cause, not from your ‘selfishness,’ weakness or ignorance, but from a real and basic threat to your 
existence: fear, because you have abandoned your weapon of survival, guilt, because you know you 
have done it volitionally. 

“The self you have betrayed is your mind; self-esteem is reliance on one’s power to think. The ego 
you seek, that essential ‘you ’ which you cannot express or define, is not your emotions or inarticulate 
dreams, but your intellect, that judge of your supreme tribunal whom you’ve impeached in order to 
drift at the mercy of any stray shyster you describe as your ‘feeling.’ Then you drag yourself through a 
self-made night, in a desperate quest for a nameless fire, moved by some fading vision of a dawn you 
had seen and lost. 

“Observe the persistence, in mankind’s mythologies, of the legend about a paradise that men had 
once possessed, the city of Atlantis or the Garden of Eden or some kingdom of perfection, always 
behind us. The root of that legend exists, not in the past of the race, but in the past of every man. You 
still retain a sense — not as firm as a memory, but diffused like the pain of hopeless longing — that 
somewhere in the starting years of your childhood, before you had learned to submit, to absorb the 
terror of unreason and to doubt the value of your mind, you had known a radiant state of existence, 
you had known the independence of a rational consciousness facing an open universe. That is the 
paradise which you have lost, which you seek — which is yours for the taking. 

“Some of you will never know who is John Galt. But those of you who have known a single 



moment of love for existence and of pride in being its worthy lover, a moment of looking at this earth 
and letting your glance be its sanction, have known the state of being a man, and I — I am only the man 
who knew that that state is not to be betrayed. I am the man who knew what made it possible and who 
chose consistently to practice and to be what you had practiced and been in that one moment. 

“That choice is yours to make. That choice — the dedication to one’s highest potential — is made by 
accepting the fact that the noblest act you have ever performed is the act of your mind in the process 
of grasping that two and two make four. 

“Whoever you are — you who are alone with my words in this moment, with nothing but your 
honesty to help you understand — the choice is still open to be a human being, but the price is to start 
from scratch, to stand naked in the face of reality and, reversing a costly historical error, to declare: ‘I 
am, therefore I’ll think.’ 

“Accept the irrevocable fact that your life depends upon your mind. Admit that the whole of your 
struggle, your doubts, your fakes, your evasions, was a desperate quest for escape from the 
responsibility of a volitional consciousness — a quest for automatic knowledge, for instinctive action, 
for intuitive certainty — and while you called it a longing for the state of an angel, what you were 
seeking was the state of an animal. Accept, as your moral ideal, the task of becoming a man. 

“Do not say that you’re afraid to trust your mind because you know so little. Are you safer in 
surrendering to mystics and discarding the little that you know? Live and act within the limit of your 
knowledge and keep expanding it to the limit of your life. Redeem your mind from the hockshops of 
authority. Accept the fact that you are not omniscient, but playing a zombie will not give you 
omniscience — that your mind is fallible, but becoming mindless will not make you infallible — that an 
error made on your own is safer than ten truths accepted on faith, because the first leaves you the 
means to correct it, but the second destroys your capacity to distinguish truth from error. In place of 
your dream of an omniscient automaton, accept the fact that any knowledge man acquires is acquired 
by his own will and effort, and that that is his distinction in the universe, that is his nature, his 
morality, his glory. 

“Discard that unlimited license to evil which consists of claiming that man is imperfect. By what 
standard do you damn him when you claim it? Accept the fact that in the realm of morality nothing 
less than perfection will do. But perfection is not to be gauged by mystic commandments to practice 
the impossible, and your moral stature is not to be gauged by matters not open to your choice. Man 
has a single basic choice: to think or not, and that is the gauge of his virtue. Moral perfection is an 
unbreached rationality — not the degree of your intelligence, but the full and relentless use of your 
mind, not the extent of your knowledge, but the acceptance of reason as an absolute. 

“Learn to distinguish the difference between errors of knowledge and breaches of morality. An 
error of knowledge is not a moral flaw, provided you are willing to correct it; only a mystic would 
judge human beings by the standard of an impossible, automatic omniscience. But a breach of 
morality is the conscious choice of an action you know to be evil, or a willful evasion of knowledge, 
a suspension of sight and of thought. That which you do not know, is not a moral charge against you; 
but that which you refuse to know, is an account of infamy growing in your soul. Make every 
allowance for errors of knowledge; do not forgive or accept any breach of morality. Give the benefit 
of the doubt to those who seek to know; but treat as potential killers those specimens of insolent 
depravity who make demands upon you, announcing that they have and seek no reasons, proclaiming, 
as a license, that they ‘just feel it’ — or those who reject an irrefutable argument by saying: ‘It’s only 



logic,’ which means: ‘It’s only reality.’ The only realm opposed to reality is the realm and premise of 
death. 

“Accept the fact that the achievement of your happiness is the only moral purpose of your life, and 
that happiness — not pain or mindless self-indulgence — is the proof of your moral integrity, since it is 
the proof and the result of your loyalty to the achievement of your values. Happiness was the 
responsibility you dreaded, it required the kind of rational discipline you did not value yourself 
enough to assume — and the anxious staleness of your days is the monument to your evasion of the 
knowledge that there is no moral substitute for happiness, that there is no more despicable coward 
than the man who deserted the battle for his joy, fearing to assert his right to existence, lacking the 
courage and the loyalty to life of a bird or a flower reaching for the sun. Discard the protective rags 
of that vice which you call a virtue: humility — learn to value yourself, which means: to fight for your 
happiness — and when you learn that pride is the sum of all virtues, you will learn to live like a man. 

“As a basic step of self-esteem, learn to treat as the mark of a cannibal any man’s demand for your 
help. To demand it is to claim that your life is his property — and loathsome as such claim might be, 
there’s something still more loathsome: your agreement. Do you ask if it’s ever proper to help another 
man? No — if he claims it as his right or as a moral duty that you owe him. Yes — if such is your own 
desire based on your own selfish pleasure in the value of his person and his struggle. Suffering as 
such is not a value; only man’s fight against suffering, is. If you choose to help a man who suffers, do 
it only on the ground of his virtues, of his fight to recover, of his rational record, or of the fact that he 
suffers unjustly; then your action is still a trade, and his virtue is the payment for your help. But to 
help a man who has no virtues, to help him on the ground of his suffering as such, to accept his faults, 
his need, as a claim — is to accept the mortgage of a zero on your values. A man who has no virtues is 
a hater of existence who acts on the premise of death; to help him is to sanction his evil and to support 
his career of destruction. Be it only a penny you will not miss or a kindly smile he has not earned, a 
tribute to a zero is treason to life and to all those who struggle to maintain it. It is of such pennies and 
smiles that the desolation of your world was made. 

“Do not say that my morality is too hard for you to practice and that you fear it as you fear the 
unknown. Whatever living moments you have known, were lived by the values of my code. But you 
stifled, negated, betrayed it. You kept sacrificing your virtues to your vices, and the best among men 
to the worst. Look around you: what you have done to society, you had done it first within your soul; 
one is the image of the other. This dismal wreckage, which is now your world, is the physical form of 
the treason you committed to your values, to your friends, to your defenders, to your future, to your 
country, to yourself. 

“We — whom you are now calling, but who will not answer any longer — we had lived among you, 
but you failed to know us, you refused to think and to see what we were. You failed to recognize the 
motor I invented — and it became, in your world, a pile of dead scrap. You failed to recognize the 
hero in your soul — and you failed to know me when I passed you in the street. When you cried in 
despair for the unattainable spirit which you felt had deserted your world, you gave it my name, but 
what you were calling was your own betrayed self-esteem. You will not recover one without the 
other. 

“When you failed to give recognition to man’s mind and attempted to rule human beings by force — 
those who submitted had no mind to surrender; those who had, were men who don’t submit. Thus the 
man of productive genius assumed in your world the disguise of a playboy and became a destroyer of 



wealth, choosing to a nni hilate his fortune rather than surrender it to guns. Thus the thinker, the man of 
reason, assumed in your world the role of a pirate, to defend his values by force against your force, 
rather than submit to the rule of brutality. Do you hear me, Francisco d’Anconia and Ragnar 
Danneskjold, my first friends, my fellow fighters, my fellow outcasts, in whose name and honor I 
speak? 

“It was the three of us who started what I am now completing. It was the three of us who resolved 
to avenge this country and to release its imprisoned soul. This greatest of countries was built on my 
morality — on the inviolate supremacy of man’s right to exist — but you dreaded to admit it and live up 
to it. You stared at an achievement unequaled in history, you looted its effects and blanked out its 
cause. In the presence of that monument to human morality, which is a factory, a highway or a bridge 
— you kept damning this country as immoral and its progress as ‘material greed,’ you kept offering 
apologies for this country’s greatness to the idol of primordial starvation, to decaying Europe’s idol 
of a leprous, mystic bum. 

“This country — the product of reason — could not survive on the morality of sacrifice. It was not 
built by men who sought self-immolation or by men who sought hand-outs. It could not stand on the 
mystic split that divorced man’s soul from his body. It could not live by the mystic doctrine that 
damned this earth as evil and those who succeeded on earth as depraved. From its start, this country 
was a threat to the ancient rule of mystics. In the brilliant rocket-explosion of its youth, this country 
displayed to an incredulous world what greatness was possible to man, what happiness was possible 
on earth. It was one or the other: America or mystics. The mystics knew it; you didn’t. You let them 
infect you with the worship of need — and this country became a giant in body with a mooching midget 
in place of its soul, while its living soul was driven underground to labor and feed you in silence, 
unnamed, unhonored, negated, its soul and hero: the industrialist. Do you hear me now, Hank Rearden, 
the greatest of the victims I have avenged? 

“Neither he nor the rest of us will return until the road is clear to rebuild this country — until the 
wreckage of the morality of sacrifice has been wiped out of our way. A country’s political system is 
based on its code of morality. We will rebuild America’s system on the moral premise which had 
been its foundation, but which you treated as a guilty underground, in your frantic evasion of the 
conflict between that premise and your mystic morality: the premise that man is an end in himself, not 
the means to the ends of others, that man’s life, his freedom, his happiness are h is by inalienable right. 

“You who’ve lost the concept of a right, you who swing in impotent evasiveness between the claim 
that rights are a gift of God, a supernatural gift to be taken on faith, or the claim that rights are a gift of 
society, to be broken at its arbitrary whim — the source of man’s rights is not divine law or 
congressional law, but the law of identity. A is A — and Man is Man. Rights are conditions of 
existence required by man’s nature for his proper survival. If man is to live on earth, it is right for 
him to use his mind, it is right to act on his own free judgment, it is right to work for his values and 
to keep the product of his work. If life on earth is his purpose, he has a right to live as a rational 
being: nature forbids him the irrational. Any group, any gang, any nation that attempts to negate man’s 
rights, is wrong, which means: is evil, which means: is anti-life. 

“ Rights are a moral concept — and morality is a matter of choice. Men are free not to choose man’s 
survival as the standard of their morals and their laws, but not free to escape from the fact that the 
alternative is a cannibal society, which exists for a while by devouring its best and collapses like a 
cancerous body, when the healthy have been eaten by the diseased, when the rational have been 



consumed by the irrational. Such has been the fate of your societies in history, but you’ve evaded the 
knowledge of the cause. I am here to state it: the agent of retribution was the law of identity, which 
you cannot escape. Just as man cannot live by means of the irrational, so two men cannot, or two 
thousand, or two billion. Just as man can’t succeed by defying reality, so a nation can’t, or a country, 
or a globe. A is A. The rest is a matter of time, provided by the generosity of victims. 

“Just as man can’t exist without his body, so no rights can exist without the right to translate one’s 
rights into reality — to think, to work and to keep the results — which means: the right of property. The 
modern mystics of muscle who offer you the fraudulent alternative of ‘human rights’ versus ‘property 
rights,’ as if one could exist without the other, are making a last, grotesque attempt to revive the 
doctrine of soul versus body. Only a ghost can exist without material property; only a slave can work 
with no right to the product of his effort. The doctrine that ‘human rights’ are superior to ‘property 
rights’ simply means that some human beings have the right to make property out of others; since the 
competent have nothing to gain from the incompetent, it means the right of the incompetent to own 
their betters and to use them as productive cattle. Whoever regards this as human and right, has no 
right to the title of ‘human.’ 

“The source of property rights is the law of causality. All property and all forms of wealth are 
produced by man’s mind and labor. As you cannot have effects without causes, so you cannot have 
wealth without its source: without intelligence. You cannot force intelligence to work: those who’re 
able to think, will not work under compulsion; those who will, won’t produce much more than the 
price of the whip needed to keep them enslaved. You cannot obtain the products of a mind except on 
the owner’s terms, by trade and by volitional consent. Any other policy of men toward man’s property 
is the policy of criminals, no matter what their numbers. Criminals are savages who play it short- 
range and starve when their prey runs out — just as you’re starving today, you who believed that crime 
could be ‘practical’ if your government decreed that robbery was legal and resistance to robbery 
illegal. 

“The only proper purpose of a government is to protect man’s rights, which means: to protect him 
from physical violence. A proper government is only a policeman, acting as an agent of man’s self- 
defense, and, as such, may resort to force only against those who start the use of force. The only 
proper functions of a government are: the police, to protect you from criminals; the army, to protect 
you from foreign invaders; and the courts, to protect your property and contracts from breach or fraud 
by others, to settle disputes by rational rules, according to objective law. But a government that 
initiates the employment of force against men who had forced no one, the employment of armed 
compulsion against disarmed victims, is a nightmare infernal machine designed to a nni hilate morality: 
such a government reverses its only moral purpose and switches from the role of protector to the role 
of man’s deadliest enemy, from the role of policeman to the role of a criminal vested with the right to 
the wielding of violence against victims deprived of the right of self-defense. Such a government 
substitutes for morality the following rule of social conduct: you may do whatever you please to your 
neighbor, provided your gang is bigger than his. 

“Only a brute, a fool or an evader can agree to exist on such terms or agree to give his fellow men 
a blank check on his life and his mind, to accept the belief that others have the right to dispose of his 
person at their whim, that the will of the majority is omnipotent, that the physical force of muscles and 
numbers is a substitute for justice, reality and truth. We, the men of the mind, we who are traders, not 
masters or slaves, do not deal in blank checks or grant them. We do not live or work with any form of 



the non-objective. 

“So long as men, in the era of savagery, had no concept of objective reality and believed that 
physical nature was ruled by the whim of unknowable demons — no thought, no science, no production 
were possible. Only when men discovered that nature was a firm, predictable absolute were they 
able to rely on their knowledge, to choose their course, to plan their future and, slowly, to rise from 
the cave. Now you have placed modern industry, with its immense complexity of scientific precision, 
back into the power of unknowable demons — the unpredictable power of the arbitrary whims of 
hidden, ugly little bureaucrats. A farmer will not invest the effort of one summer if he’s unable to 
calculate his chances of a harvest. But you expect industrial giants — who plan in terms of decades, 
invest in terms of generations and undertake ninety-nine-year contracts — to continue to function and 
produce, not knowing what random caprice in the skull of what random official will descend upon 
them at what moment to demolish the whole of their effort. Drifters and physical laborers live and 
plan by the range of a day. The better the mind, the longer the range. A man whose vision extends to a 
shanty, might continue to build on your quicksands, to grab a fast profit and run. A man who envisions 
skyscrapers, will not. Nor will he give ten years of unswerving devotion to the task of inventing a 
new product, when he knows that gangs of entrenched mediocrity are juggling the laws against him, to 
tie him, restrict him and force him to fail, but should he fight them and struggle and succeed, they will 
seize his rewards and his invention. 

“Look past the range of the moment, you who cry that you fear to compete with men of superior 
intelligence, that their mind is a threat to your livelihood, that the strong leave no chance to the weak 
in a market of voluntary trade. What determines the material value of your work? Nothing but the 
productive effort of your mind — if you lived on a desert island. The less efficient the thinking of your 
brain, the less your physical labor would bring you — and you could spend your life on a single 
routine, collecting a precarious harvest or hunting with bow and arrows, unable to think any further. 
But when you live in a rational society, where men are free to trade, you receive an incalculable 
bonus: the material value of your work is determined not only by your effort, but by the effort of the 
best productive minds who exist in the world around you. 

“When you work in a modern factory, you are paid, not only for your labor, but for all the 
productive genius which has made that factory possible: for the work of the industrialist who built it, 
for the work of the investor who saved the money to risk on the untried and the new, for the work of 
the engineer who designed the machines of which you are pushing the levers, for the work of the 
inventor who created the product which you spend your time on making, for the work of the scientist 
who discovered the laws that went into the making of that product, for the work of the philosopher 
who taught men how to think and whom you spend your time denouncing. 

“The machine, the frozen form of a living intelligence, is the power that expands the potential of 
your life by raising the productivity of your time. If you worked as a blacksmith in the mystics’ 
Middle Ages, the whole of your earning capacity would consist of an iron bar produced by your 
hands in days and days of effort. How many tons of rail do you produce per day if you work for Hank 
Rearden? Would you dare to claim that the size of your pay check was created solely by your physical 
labor and that those rails were the product of your muscles? The standard of living of that blacksmith 
is all that your muscles are worth; the rest is a gift from Hank Rearden. 

“Every man is free to rise as far as he’s able or willing, but it’s only the degree to which he thinks 
that determines the degree to which he’ll rise. Physical labor as such can extend no further than the 



range of the moment. The man who does no more than physical labor, consumes the material value- 
equivalent of his own contribution to the process of production, and leaves no further value, neither 
for himself nor others. But the man who produces an idea in any field of rational endeavor — the man 
who discovers new knowledge — is the permanent benefactor of humanity. Material products can’t be 
shared, they belong to some ultimate consumer; it is only the value of an idea that can be shared with 
unlimited numbers of men, making all sharers richer at no one’s sacrifice or loss, raising the 
productive capacity of whatever labor they perform It is the value of his own time that the strong of 
the intellect transfers to the weak, letting them work on the jobs he discovered, while devoting his 
time to further discoveries. This is mutual trade to mutual advantage; the interests of the mind are one, 
no matter what the degree of intelligence, among men who desire to work and don’t seek or expect the 
unearned. 

“In proportion to the mental energy he spent, the man who creates a new invention receives but a 
small percentage of his value in terms of material payment, no matter what fortune he makes, no 
matter what millions he earns. But the man who works as a janitor in the factory producing that 
invention, receives an enormous payment in proportion to the mental effort that his job requires of 
him. And the same is true of all men between, on all levels of ambition and ability. The man at the top 
of the intellectual pyramid contributes the most of all those below him, but gets nothing except his 
material payment, receiving no intellectual bonus from others to add to the value of his time. The man 
at the bottom who, left to himself, would starve in his hopeless ineptitude, contributes nothing to those 
above him, but receives the bonus of all of their brains. Such is the nature of the ‘competition’ 
between the strong and the weak of the intellect. Such is the pattern of ‘exploitation’ for which you 
have damned the strong. 

“Such was the service we had given you and were glad and willing to give. What did we ask in 
return? Nothing but freedom. We required that you leave us free to function — free to think and to work 
as we choose — free to take our own risks and to bear our own losses — free to earn our own profits 
and to make our own fortunes — free to gamble on your rationality, to submit our products to your 
judgment for the purpose of a voluntary trade, to rely on the objective value of our work and on your 
mind’s ability to see it — free to count on your intelligence and honesty, and to deal with nothing but 
your mind. Such was the price we asked, which you chose to reject as too high. You decided to call it 
unfair that we, who had dragged you out of your hovels and provided you with modern apartments, 
with radios, movies and cars, should own our palaces and yachts — you decided that you had a right to 
your wages, but we had no right to our profits, that you did not want us to deal with your mind, but to 
deal, instead, with your gun. Our answer to that, was: ‘May you be damned!’ Our answer came true. 
You are. 

“You did not care to compete in terms of intelligence — you are now competing in terms of brutality. 
You did not care to allow rewards to be won by successful production — you are now running a race 
in which rewards are won by successful plunder. You called it selfish and cruel that men should trade 
value for value — you have now established an unselfish society where they trade extortion for 
extortion. Your system is a legal civil war, where men gang up on one another and struggle for 
possession of the law, which they use as a club over rivals, till another gang wrests it from their 
clutch and clubs them with it in their turn, all of them clamoring protestations of service to an 
unnamed public’s unspecified good. You had said that you saw no difference between economic and 
political power, between the power of money and the power of guns — no difference between reward 



and punishment, no difference between purchase and plunder, no difference between pleasure and 
fear, no difference between life and death. You are learning the difference now. 

“Some of you might plead the excuse of your ignorance, of a limited mind and a limited range. But 
the damned and the guiltiest among you are the men who had the capacity to know, yet chose to blank 
out reality, the men who were willing to sell their intelligence into cynical servitude to force: the 
contemptible breed of those mystics of science who profess a devotion to some sort of ‘pure 
knowledge’ — the purity consisting of their claim that such knowledge has no practical purpose on this 
earth — who reserve their logic for inanimate matter, but believe that the subject of dealing with men 
requires and deserves no rationality, who scorn money and sell their souls in exchange for a 
laboratory supplied by loot. And since there is no such thing as ‘non-practical knowledge’ or any sort 
of ‘disinterested’ action, since they scorn the use of their science for the purpose and profit of life, 
they deliver their science to the service of death, to the only practical purpose it can ever have for 
looters: to inventing weapons of coercion and destruction. They, the intellects who seek escape from 
moral values, they are the damned on this earth, theirs is the guilt beyond forgiveness. Do you hear 
me, Dr. Robert Stadler? 

“But it is not to him that I wish to speak. I am speaking to those among you who have retained some 
sovereign shred of their soul, unsold and unstamped: ‘ — to the order of others.’ If, in the chaos of the 
motives that have made you listen to the radio tonight, there was an honest, rational desire to learn 
what is wrong with the world, you are the man whom I wished to address. By the rules and terms of 
my code, one owes a rational statement to those whom it does concern and who ’re making an effort to 
know. Those who ’re making an effort to fail to understand me, are not a concern of mine. 

“I am speaking to those who desire to live and to recapture the honor of their soul. Now that you 
know the truth about your world, stop supporting your own destroyers. The evil of the world is made 
possible by nothing but the sanction you give it. Withdraw your sanction. Withdraw your support. Do 
not try to live on your enemies’ terms or to win at a game where they’re setting the rules. Do not seek 
the favor of those who enslaved you, do not beg for alms from those who have robbed you, be it 
subsidies, loans or jobs, do not join their team to recoup what they’ve taken by helping them rob your 
neighbors. One cannot hope to maintain one’s life by accepting bribes to condone one’s destruction. 
Do not struggle for profit, success or security at the price of a lien on your right to exist. Such a lien is 
not to be paid off; the more you pay them, the more they will demand; the greater the values you seek 
or achieve, the more vulnerably helpless you become. Theirs is a system of white blackmail devised 
to bleed you, not by means of your sins, but by means of your love for existence. 

“Do not attempt to rise on the looters’ terms or to climb a ladder while they’re holding the ropes. 
Do not allow their hands to touch the only power that keeps them in power: your living ambition. Go 
on strike — in the manner I did. Use your mind and skill in private, extend your knowledge, develop 
your ability, but do not share your achievements with others. Do not try to produce a fortune, with a 
looter riding on your back. Stay on the lowest rung of their ladder, earn no more than your barest 
survival, do not make an extra penny to support the looters’ state. Since you’re captive, act as a 
captive, do not help them pretend that you’re free. Be the silent, incorruptible enemy they dread. 
When they force you, obey — but do not volunteer. Never volunteer a step in their direction, or a 
wish, or a plea, or a purpose. Do not help a holdup man to claim that he acts as your friend and 
benefactor. Do not help your jailers to pretend that their jail is your natural state of existence. Do not 
help them to fake reality. That fake is the only dam holding off their secret terror, the terror of 



knowing they’re unfit to exist; remove it and let them drown; your sanction is their only life belt. 

“If you find a chance to vanish into some wilderness out of their reach, do so, but not to exist as a 
bandit or to create a gang competing with their racket; build a productive life of your own with those 
who accept your moral code and are willing to struggle for a human existence. You have no chance to 
win on the Morality of Death or by the code of faith and force; raise a standard to which the honest 
will repair: the standard of Life and Reason. 

“Act as a rational being and aim at becoming a rallying point for all those who are starved for a 
voice of integrity — act on your rational values, whether alone in the midst of your enemies, or with a 
few of your chosen friends, or as the founder of a modest community on the frontier of mankind’s 
rebirth. 

“When the looters’ state collapses, deprived of the best of its slaves, when it falls to a level of 
impotent chaos, like the mystic-ridden nations of the Orient, and dissolves into starving robber gangs 
fighting to rob one another — when the advocates of the morality of sacrifice perish with their final 
ideal — then and on that day we will return. 

“We will open the gates of our city to those who deserve to enter, a city of smokestacks, pipe lines, 
orchards, markets and inviolate homes. We will act as the rallying center for such hidden outposts as 
you’ll build. With the sign of the dollar as our symbol — the sign of free trade and free minds — we 
will move to reclaim this country once more from the impotent savages who never discovered its 
nature, its meaning, its splendor. Those who choose to join us, will join us; those who don’t, will not 
have the power to stop us; hordes of savages have never been an obstacle to men who carried the 
banner of the mind. 

“Then this country will once more become a sanctuary for a vanishing species: the rational being. 
The political system we will build is contained in a single moral premise: no man may obtain any 
values from others by resorting to physical force. Every man will stand or fall, live or die by his 
rational judgment. If he fails to use it and falls, he will be his only victim. If he fears that his judgment 
is inadequate, he will not be given a gun to improve it. If he chooses to correct his errors in time, he 
will have the unobstructed example of his betters, for guidance in learning to think; but an end will be 
put to the infamy of paying with one life for the errors of another. 

“In that world, you’ll be able to rise in the morning with the spirit you had known in your 
childhood: that spirit of eagerness, adventure and certainty which comes from dealing with a rational 
universe. No child is afraid of nature; it is your fear of men that will vanish, the fear that has stunted 
your soul, the fear you acquired in your early encounters with the incomprehensible, the 
unpredictable, the contradictory, the arbitrary, the hidden, the faked, the irrational in men. You will 
live in a world of responsible beings, who will be as consistent and reliable as facts; the guarantee of 
their character will be a system of existence where objective reality is the standard and the judge. 
Your virtues will be given protection, your vices and weaknesses will not. Every chance will be open 
to your good, none will be provided for your evil. What you’ll receive from men will not be alms, or 
pity, or mercy, or forgiveness of sins, but a single value: justice. And when you’ll look at men or at 
yourself, you will feel, not disgust, suspicion and guilt, but a single constant: respect. 

“Such is the future you are capable of winning. It requires a struggle; so does any human value. All 
life is a purposeful struggle and your only choice is the choice of a goal. Do you wish to continue the 
battle of your present or do you wish to fight for my world? Do you wish to continue a struggle that 
consists of clinging to precarious ledges in a sliding descent to the abyss, a struggle where the 



hardships you endure are irreversible and the victories you win bring you closer to destruction? Or 
do you wish to undertake a struggle that consists of rising from ledge to ledge in a steady ascent to the 
top, a struggle where the hardships are investments in your future, and the victories bring you 
irreversibly closer to the world of your moral ideal, and should you die without reaching full sunlight, 
you will die on a level touched by its rays? Such is the choice before you. Let your mind and your 
love of existence decide. 

“The last of my words will be addressed to those heroes who might still be hidden in the world, 
those who are held prisoner, not by their evasions, but by their virtues and their desperate courage. 
My brothers in spirit, check on your virtues and on the nature of the enemies you’re serving. Your 
destroyers hold you by means of your endurance, your generosity, your innocence, your love — the 
endurance that carries their burdens — the generosity that responds to their cries of despair — the 
innocence that is unable to conceive of their evil and gives them the benefit of every doubt, refusing to 
condemn them without understanding and incapable of understanding such motives as theirs — the 
love, your love of life, which makes you believe that they are men and that they love it, too. But the 
world of today is the world they wanted; life is the object of their hatred. Leave them to the death they 
worship. In the name of your magnificent devotion to this earth, leave them, don’t exhaust the 
greatness of your soul on achieving the triumph of the evil of theirs. Do you hear me . . . my love? 

“In the name of the best within you, do not sacrifice this world to those who are its worst. In the 
name of the values that keep you alive, do not let your vision of man be distorted by the ugly, the 
cowardly, the mindless in those who have never achieved his title. Do not lose your knowledge that 
man’s proper estate is an upright posture, an intransigent mind and a step that travels unlimited roads. 
Do not let your fire go out, spark by irreplaceable spark, in the hopeless swamps of the approximate, 
the not-quite, the not-yet, the not-at-all. Do not let the hero in your soul perish, in lonely frustation for 
the life you deserved, but have never been able to reach. Check your road and the nature of your 
battle. The world you desired can be won, it exists, it is real, it is possible, it’s yours. 

“But to win it requires your total dedication and a total break with the world of your past, with the 
doctrine that man is a sacrificial animal who exists for the pleasure of others. Fight for the value of 
your person. Fight for the virtue of your pride. Fight for the essence of that which is man: for his 
sovereign rational mind. Fight with the radiant certainty and the absolute recitude of knowing that 
yours is the Morality of Life and that yours is the battle for any achievement, any value, any grandeur, 
any goodness, any joy that has ever existed on this earth. 

“You will win when you are ready to pronounce the oath I have taken at the start of my battle — and 
for those who wish to know the day of my return, I shall now repeat it to the hearing of the world: 

“I swear — by my life and my love of it — that I will never live for the sake of another man, nor ask 
another man to live for mine.”

I am indebted to Nathaniel Branden for many valuable observations on this subject and for his 
eloquent designation of the two archetypes, which I shall use hereafter: Attila and the Witch Doctor.

The epistemological chaos of today makes it necessary to stress that men have the right and the moral 
obligation of self-defense, that is: the right to use physical force only as retaliation and only against 
those who initiate its use. For a detailed discussion, see Galt’s speech.
