THEORY AND HISTORY 


1. WHAT IS CAPITALISM? 

BY AYN RAND 

The disintegration of philosophy in the nineteenth century 
and its collapse in the twentieth have led to a similar, though 
much slower and less obvious, process in the course of 
modern science. 

Today’s frantic development in the field of technology has 
a quality reminiscent of the days preceding the economic 
crash of 1929: riding on the momentum of the past, on the 
unacknowledged remnants of an Aristotelian epistemology, it 
is a hectic, feverish expansion, heedless of the fact that its 
theoretical account is long since overdrawn — that in the field 
of scientific theory, unable to integrate or interpret their own 
data, scientists are abetting the resurgence of a primitive 
mysticism. In the humanities, however, the crash is past, the 
depression has set in, and the collapse of science is all but 
complete. 

The clearest evidence of it may be seen in such compara- 
tively young sciences as psychology and political economy. In 
psychology, one may observe the attempt to study human 
behavior without reference to the fact that man is conscious. 
In political economy, one may observe the attempt to study 
and to devise social systems without reference to man. 

It is philosophy that defines and establishes the epistemolog- 
ical criteria to guide human knowledge in general and 
specific sciences in particular. Political economy came into 
prominence in the nineteenth century, in the era of philoso- 
phy’s post-Kantian disintegration, and no one rose to check 
its premises or to challenge its base. Implicitly, uncritically, 
and by default, political economy accepted as its axioms the 
fundamental tenets of collectivism.

Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal 

Political economists — including the advocates of capital- 
ism — defined their science as the study of the management or 
direction or organization or manipulation of a “community’s" 
or a nation’s “resources." The nature of these “resources" 
was not defined; their communal ownership was taken for 
granted — and the goal of political economy was assumed to 
be the study of how to utilize these “resources” for “the 
common good.” 

The fact that the principal “resource" involved was man 
himself, that he was an entity of a specific nature with 
specific capacities and requirements, was given the most 
superficial attention, if any. Man was regarded simply as one 
of the factors of production, along with land, forests, or 
mines — as one of the less significant factors, since more study 
was devoted to the influence and quality of these others than 
to his role or quality. 

Political economy was, in effect, a science starting in 
midstream: it observed that men were producing and trad- 
ing, it took for granted that they had always done so and 
always would — it accepted this fact as the given, requiring no 
further consideration — and it addressed itself to the problem 
of how to devise the best way for the “community" to 
dispose of human effort. 

There were many reasons for this tribal view of man. The 
morality of altruism was one; the growing dominance of 
political statism among the intellectuals of the nineteenth 
century was another. Psychologically, the main reason was 
the soul-body dichotomy permeating European culture: ma- 
terial production was regarded as a demeaning task of a 
lower order, unrelated to the concerns of man’s intellect, a 
task assigned to slaves or serfs since the beginning of record- 
ed history. The institution of serfdom had lasted, in one form 
or another, till well into the nineteenth century; it was 
abolished, politically, only by the advent of capitalism; politi- 
cally, but not intellectually. 

TTie concept of man as a free, independent individual 
profoundly alien to the culture of Europe. It was 
culture down to its roots; in European thinking, the 
the entity, the unit, and man was only one of its 
cells. This applied to rulers and serfs alike: the 
believed to hold their privileges only by virtue of 
they rendered to the tribe, services regarded 
order, namely, armed force or military defense, 
man was as much chattel of the tribe as a serf: 
property belonged to the king. It must be 




13 


What Is Capitalism? 

the institution of private property, in the full, legal meaning 
of the term, was brought into existence only by capitalism. In 
the pre-capitalist eras, private property existed de facto , but 
not de jure, i.e., by custom and sufferance, not by right or by 
law. In law and in principle, all property belonged to the 
head of the tribe, the king, and was held only by his permis- 
sion, which could be revoked at any time, at his pleasure. 
(The king could and did expropriate the estates of recalci- 
trant noblemen throughout the course of Europe’s his- 
tory.) 

The American philosophy of the Rights of Man was never 
grasped fully by European intellectuals. Europe’s predomi- 
nant idea of emancipation consisted of changing the concept 
of man as a slave of the absolute state embodied by a king, 
to the concept of man as a slave of the absolute state 
embodied by “the people” — i.e., switching from slavery to a 
tribal chief into slavery to the tribe. A non-tribal view of 
existence could not penetrate the mentalities that regarded 
the privilege of ruling material producers by physical force as 
a badge of nobility. 

Thus Europe’s thinkers did not notice the fact that during 
the nineteenth century, the galley slaves had been replaced by 
the inventors of steamboats, and the village blacksmiths by 
the owners of blast furnaces, and they went on thinking in 
such terms (such contradictions in terms) as “wage slavery” 
or “the antisocial selfishness of industrialists who take so 
much from society without giving anything in return”— on 
the unchallenged axiom that wealth is an anonymous, social, 
tribal product. 

That notion has not been challenged to this day; it rep- 
resents the implicit assumption and the base of contemporary 
political economy. 

As an example of this view and its consequences, I 6hall 
cite the article on “Capitalism” in the Encyclopaedia Britan- 
nica. The article gives no definition of its subject; it opens as 
follows: 

capitalism, a term used to denote the economic sys- 
tem that has been dominant in the western world 6ince 
the breakup of feudalism. Fundamental to any system 
called capitalist are the relations between private own- 
ers of nonpersonal means of production (land, mines, 
industrial plants, etc., collectively known as capital) 
[italics mine] and free but capitalless workers, who sell 
their labour services to employers. . . . The resulting 
wage bargains determine the proportion in which the

Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal 

total product of society will be shared between the class 
of labourers and the class of capitalist entrepreneurs . 1 

(I quote from Galt’s speech in Atlas Shrugged, from a 
passage describing the tenets of collectivism: "An industrial- 
ist — blank-out — there is no such person. A factory is a ‘natu- 
ral resource,' like a tree, a rock or a mud-puddle.”) 

The success of capitalism is explained by the Britannica as 
follows: 

Productive use of the “social surplus” was the special 
virtue that enabled capitalism to outstrip all prior 
economic systems. Instead of building pyramids and 
cathedrals, those in command of the social surplus 
chose to invest in ships, warehouses, raw materials, 
finished goods and other material forms of wealth. The 
social surplus was thus converted into enlarged produc- 
tive capacity. 

This is said about a time when Europe's population sub- 
sisted in such poverty that child mortality approached fifty 
percent, and periodic famines wiped out the “surplus” popu- 
lation which file pre-capitalist economies were unable to feed. 
Yet, m akin g no distinction between tax-expropriated and 
industrially produced wealth, the Britannica asserts that it 
was the surplus wealth of that time that the early capitalists 
“commanded” and “chose to invest” — and that this invest- 
ment was the cause of the stupendous prosperity of the age 
that followed. 

What is a “social surplus”? The article gives no definition 
or explanation. A “surplus” presupposes a norm; if subsis- 
tence on a chronic starvation level is above the implied 
norm, what is that norm? The article does not answer. 

There is, of course, no such thing as a “social surplus.” All 
wealth is produced by somebody and belongs to somebody. 
And “the special virtue that enabled capitalism to outstrip all 
prior economic systems” was freedom (a concept eloquently 
absent from the Britannlca’s account), which led, not to the 
expropriation, but to the creation of wealth. 

I shall have more to say later about that disgraceful article 
(disgraceful on many counts, not the least of which is schol- 
arship). At this point, I quoted it only as a succinct example 
of the tribal premise that underlies today's political economy. 
That premise is shared by the enemies and the champions of 
capitalism alike; it provides the former with a certain inner

15 


What Is Capitalism? 

consistency, and disarms the latter by a subtle, yet devastat- 
ing aura of moral hypocrisy — as witness, their attempts to 
justify capitalism on the ground of “the common good” or 
“service to the consumer” or “the best allocation of resourc- 
es.” ( Whose resources?) 

If capitalism is to be understood, it is this tribal premise 
that has to be checked — and challenged. 

Mankind is not an entity, an organism, or a coral bush. 
The entity involved in production and trade is man. It is with 
the study of man — not of the loose aggregate known as a 
“community” — that any science of the humanities has to 
begin. 

This issue represents one of the epistemological differences 
between the humanities and the physical sciences, one of the 
causes of the former’s well-earned inferiority complex in 
regard to the latter. A physical science would not permit 
itself (not yet, at least) to ignore or bypass the nature of its 
subject Such an attempt would mean: a science of astrono- 
my that gazed at the sky, but refused to study individual 
stars, planets, and satellites — or a science of medicine that 
studied disease, without any knowledge or criterion of 
health, and took, as its basic subject of study, a hospital as a 
whole, never focusing on individual patients. 

A great deal may be learned about society by studying 
man; but this process cannot be reversed: nothing can be 
learned about man by studying society— by studying the 
inter-relationships of entities one has never identified or 
defined. Yet that is the methodology adopted by most politi- 
cal economists. Their attitude, in effect, amounts to the 
unstated, implicit postulate: “Man is that which fits economic 
equations.” Since he obviously does not, this leads to the 
curious fact that in spite of the practical nature of their 
science, political economists are oddly unable to relate their 
abstractions to the concretes of actual existence. 

It leads also to a baffling sort of double standard or double 
perspective in their way of viewing men and events: if they 
observe a shoemaker, they find no difficulty in concluding 
that he fa working in order to make a living; but as political 
economists, on the tribal premise, they declare that his pur- 
pose (and duty) fa to provide society with shoes. If they 
observe a panhandler on a street corner, they identify him as 
a bum; in political economy, he becomes “a sovereign con- 
sumer.” If they hear the communist doctrine that all property 
should belong to the state, they reject it emphatically and 
feel, sincerely , that they would fight communism to the 
death; but in political economy, they speak of the govern- 



16 


Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal 

ment’s duty to effect “a fair redistribution of wealth,” and 
they speak of businessmen as the best, most efficient trustees 
of the nation’s “natural resources.” 

This is what a basic premise (and philosophical negli- 
gence) will do; this is what the tribal premise has done. 

To reject that premise and begin at the beginning — in one’s 
approach to political economy and to the evaluation of 
various social systems — one must begin by identifying man’s 
nature, i.e., those essential characteristics which distinguish 
hi m from all other living species. 

Man’s essential characteristic is his rational faculty. Man's 
mind is his basic means of survival — his only means of 
gaining knowledge. 

Man cannot survive, as animals do, by the guidance of 
mere percepts. . . . He cannot provide for his simplest 
physical needs without a process of thought. He needs 
a process of thought to discover how to plant and grow 
his food or how to make weapons for hunting. His 
percepts might lead him to a cave, if one is available — 
nut to build the simplest shelter, he needs a process of 
thought No percepts and no “instincts” will tell him 
how to light a fire, how to weave cloth, how to forge 
tools, how to make a wheel, how to make an airplane, 
how to perform an appendectomy, how to produce an 
electric light bulb or an electronic tube or a cyclotron 
or a box of matches. Yet his life depends on such 
knowledge — and only a volitional act of his conscious- 
ness, a process of thought can provide it a 

A process of thought is an enormously complex process of 
identification and integration, which only an individual min d 
can perform. There is no such thing as a collective brain. 
Men can learn from one another, but learning requires a 
process of thought on the part of every individual student. 
Men can cooperate in the discovery of new knowledge, but 
such cooperation requires the independent exercise of his 
rational faculty by every individual scientist Man is the only 
living species that can transmit and expand his store of 
knowledge from generation to generation; but such transmis- 
sion requires a process of thought on the part of the individu- 
al recipients. As witness, the breakdowns of civilization, the 
dark ages in the history of mankind’s progress, when the 
accumulated knowledge of centuries vanished from the lives 
of men who were unable, unwilling, or forbidden to think.

What Is Capitalism? 

In order to sustain its life, every living species has to 
follow a certain course of action required by its nature. The 
action required to sustain human life is primarily intellectual: 
everything man needs has to be discovered by his mind and 
produced by his effort. Production is the application of rea- 
son to the problem of survival. 

If some men do not choose to think, they can survive only 
by imitating and repeating a routine of work discovered by 
others — but those others had to discover it, or none would 
have survived. If some men do not choose to think or to 
work, they can survive (temporarily) only by looting the 
goods produced by others — but those others had to produce 
them, or none would have survived. Regardless of what 
choice is made, in this issue, by any man or by any number 
of men, regardless of what blind, irrational, or evil course 
they may choose to pursue — the fact remains that reason is 
man’s means of survival and that men prosper or fail, survive 
or perish in proportion to the degree of their rationality. 

Since knowledge, thinking, and rational action are proper- 
ties of the individual, since the choice to exercise his rational 
faculty or not depends on the individual, man’s survival 
requires that those who think be free of the interference of 
those who don’t. Since men are neither omniscient nor infalli- 
ble, they must be free to agree or disagree, to cooperate or 
to pursue their own independent course, each according to 
his own rational judgment. Freedom is the fundamental re- 
quirement of man’s mind. 

A rational mind does not work under compulsion; it does 
not subordinate its grasp of reality to anyone’s orders, direc- 
tives, or controls; it does not sacrifice its knowledge, its view 
of the truth, to anyone’s opinions, threats, wishes, plans, or 
’‘welfare.” Such a mind may be hampered by others, it may 
be silenced, proscribed, imprisoned, or destroyed; it cannot 
be forced; a gun is not an argument. (An example and 
symbol of this attitude is Galileo.) 

It is from the work and the inviolate integrity of such 
minds — from the intransigent innovators — that all of man- 
kind’s knowledge and achievements have come. (See The 
Fountainhead.) It is to such minds that mankind owes its 
survival. (See Atlas Shrugged.) 

The same principle applies to all men, on every level of 
ability and ambition. To the extent that a man is guided by 
his rational judgment, he acts in accordance with the require- 
ments of his nature and, to that extent, succeeds in achieving 
a human form of survival and well-being; to the extent that 
he acts irrationally, he acts as his own destroyer. 



18 Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal 

The social recognition of man’s rational nature — of the 
connection between his survival and his use of reason — is the 
concept of individual rights. 

I shall remind you that “rights” are a moral principle 
defining and sanctioning a man’s freedom of action in a 
social context, that they are derived from man’s nature as a 
rational being and represent a necessary condition of his 
particular mode of survival. I shall remind you also that the 
right to life is the source of all rights, including the right to 
property. 8 

In regard to political economy, this last requires special 
emphasis: man has to work and produce in order to support 
his life. He has to support his life by his own effort and by 
the guidance of his own mind. If he cannot dispose of the 
product of his effort, he cannot dispose of his effort; if he 
cannot dispose of his effort, he cannot dispose of his life. 
Without property rights, no other rights can be practiced. 

Now, bearing these facts in mind, consider the question of 
what social system is appropriate to man. 

A social system is a set of moral-political-economic princi- 
ples embodied in a society's laws, institutions, and govern- 
ment, which determine the relationships, the terms of associ- 
ation, among the men living in a given geographical area. It 
is obvious that these terms and relationships depend on an 
identification of man’s nature, that they would be different if 
they pertain to a society of rational beings or to a colony of 
ants. It is obvious that they will be radically different if men 
deal with one another as free, independent individuals, on the 
premise that every man is an end in himself — or as members 
of a pack, each regarding the others as the means to his ends 
and to the ends of “the pack as a whole.” 

There are only two fundamental questions (or two aspects 
of the same question) that determine the nature of any social 
system: Does a social system recognize individual rights? — 
and: Does a social system ban physical force from human 
relationships? The answer to the second question is the prac- 
tical implementation of the answer to the first 

Is man a sovereign individual who owns his person, his 
mind, his life, his work and its products — or is he the proper- 
ty of the tribe (the state, the society, the collective) that may 
dispose of him in any way it pleases, that may dictate his 
convictions, prescribe the course of his life, control his work 
and expropriate his products? Does man have the right to

Rights" in the appendix, and “Collectivized ‘Rights’ " in The Virtue of 
Selfishness.

What Is Capitalism? 

exist for his own sake — or is he born in bondage, as an 
indentured servant who must keep buying his life by serving 
the tribe but can never acquire it free and clear? 

This is the first question to answer. The rest is conse- 
quences and practical implementations. The basic issue is 
only: Is man free? 

In mankind’s history, capitalism is the only system that 
answers: Yes. 

Capitalism is a social system based on the recognition of 
individual rights, including property rights, in which all prop- 
erty is privately owned. 

The recognition of individual rights entails the banishment 
of physical force from human relationships: basically, rights 
can be violated only by means of force. In a capitalist 
society, no man or group may initiate the use of physical 
force against others. The only function of the government, in 
such a society, is the task of protecting man’s rights, lx., the 
task of protecting him from physical force; the government 
acts as the agent of man’s right of self-defense, and may use 
force only in retaliation and only against those who initiate 
its use; thus the government is the means of placing the 
retaliatory use of force under objective control . 4 

It is the basic, metaphysical fact of man’s nature — the 
connection between his survival and his use of reason — that 
capitalism recognizes and protects. 

In a capitalist society, all human relationships are volun- 
tary. Men are free to cooperate or not, to deal with one 
another or not, as their own individual judgments, convic- 
tions, and interests dictate. They can deal with one another 
only in terms of and by means of reason, i.e., by means of 
discussion, persuasion, and contractual agreement, by volun- 
tary choice to mutual benefit The right to agree with others 
is not a problem in any society, it is the right to disagree that 
is crucial. It is the institution of private property that protects 
and implements the right to disagree — and thus keeps the 
road open to man’s most valuable attribute (valuable personal- 
ly, socially, and objectively ) : the creative mind. 

This is the cardinal difference between capitalism and 
collectivism. 

The power that determines the establishment, the changes, 
the evolution, and the destruction of social systems is philoso- 
phy. The role of chance, accident, or tradition, in this con- 
text, is the same as their role in the life of an individual: 
their power stands in inverse ratio to the power of a culture's

Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal 

(or an individual’s) philosophical equipment, and grows as 
philosophy collapses. It is, therefore, by reference to philoso- 
phy that the character of a social system has to be defined 
and evaluated. Corresponding to the four branches of philos- 
ophy, the four keystones of capitalism are: metaphysically, 
the requirements of man’s nature and survival — epistemolog- 
ically, reason — ethically, individual rights — politically, free- 
dom. 

This, in substance, is the base of the proper approach to 
political economy and to an understanding of capitalism — not 
the tribal premise inherited from prehistorical traditions. 

The “practical” justification of capitalism does not lie in 
the collectivist claim that it effects “the best allocation of 
national resources.” Man is not a “national resource" and 
neither is his mind — and without the creative power of man’s 
intelligence, raw materials remain just so many useless raw 
materials. 

The moral justification of capitalism does not lie in the 
altruist claim that it represents the best way to achieve “the 
common good.” It is true that capitalism docs — if that catch- 
phrase has any meaning — but this is merely a secondary 
consequence. The moral justification of capitalism lies in the 
fact that it is the only system consonant with man’s rational 
nature, that it protects man’s survival qua man, and that its 
ruling principle is: justice . 

Every social system is based, explicitly or implicitly, on 
some theory of ethics. The tribal notion of “the common 
good” has served as the moral justification of most social 
systems — and of all tyrannies — in history. The degree of a 
society’s enslavement or freedom corresponded to the degree 
to which that tribal slogan was invoked or ignored. 

“The common good” (or “the public interest”) is an un- 
defined and undefinable concept: there is no such entity as 
“the tribe” or “the public"; the tribe (or the public or 
society) is only a number of individual men. Nothing can be 
good for the tribe as such; “good” and “value” pertain only 
to a living organism — to an individual living organism — not 
to a disembodied aggregate of relationships. 

“The common good" is a meaningless concept, unless tak- 
en literally, in which case its only possible meaning is: the 
sum of the good of all the individual men involved. But in 
that case, the concept is meaningless as a moral criterion: it 
leaves open the question of what is the good of individual 
men and how does one determine it? 

It is not, however, in its literal meaning that that concept 
is generally used. It is accepted precisely for its elastic, 



21 


What Is Capitalism? 

undcfinable, mystical character which serves, not as a moral 
guide, but as an escape from morality. Since the good is not 
applicable to the disembodied, it becomes a moral blank 
check for those who attempt to embody it. 

When “the common good" of a society is regarded as 
something apart from and superior to the individual good of 
its members, it means that the good of some men takes 
precedence over the good of others, with those others con- 
signed to the status of sacrificial animals. It is tacitly as- 
sumed, in such cases, that “the common good” means “the 
good of the majority ” as against the minority or the individu- 
al. Observe the significant fact that that assumption is tacit: 
even the most collectivized mentalities seem to sense the 
impossibility of justifying it morally. But “the good of the 
majority," too, is only a pretense and a delusion: since, in 
fact, the violation of an individual’s rights means the abroga- 
tion of all rights, it delivers the helpless majority into the 
power of any gang that proclaims itself to be “the voice of 
society” and proceeds to rule by means of physical force, 
until deposed by another gang employing the same means. 

If one begins by defining the good of individual men, one 
will accept as proper only a society in which that good is 
achieved and achievable. But if one begins by accepting “the 
common good" as an axiom and regarding individual good as 
its possible but not necessary consequence (not necessary in 
any particular case), one ends up with such a gruesome 
absurdity as Soviet Russia, a country professedly dedicated to 
“the common good," where, with the exception of a minus- 
cule clique of rulers, the entire population has existed in 
subhuman misery for over two generations. 

What makes the victims and, worse, the observers accept 
this and other similar historical atrocities, and still cling to 
the myth of “the common good”? The answer lies in philoso- 
phy — in philosophical theories on the nature of moral val- 
ues. 

There are, in essence, three schools of thought on the 
nature of the good: the intrinsic, the subjective, and the 
objective. The intrinsic theory holds that the good is inherent 
in certain things or actions as such, regardless of their con- 
text and consequences, regardless of any benefit or injury 
they may cause to the actors and subjects involved. It is a 
theory that divorces the concept of “good" from benefici- 
aries, and the concept of “value" from valuer and purpose — 
claiming that the good is good in, by, and of itself. 

The subjectivist theory holds that the good bears no rela- 
tion to the facts of reality, that it is the product of a man’s 



22 


Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal 

consciousness, created by his feelings, desires, “intuitions,” or 
whims, and that it is merely an “arbitrary postulate” or an 
“emotional commitment.” 

The intrinsic theory holds that the good resides in some 
sort of reality, independent of man’s consciousness; the sub- 
jectivist theory holds that the good resides in man’s con- 
sciousness, independent of reality. 

The objective theory holds that the good is neither an 
attribute of “things in themselves” nor of man’s emotional 
states, but an evaluation of the facts of reality by man’s 
consciousness according to a rational standard of value. (Ra- 
tional, in this context, means: derived from the facts of 
reality and validated by a process of reason.) The objective 
theory holds that the good is an aspect of reality in relation 
to man — and that it must be discovered, not invented, by 
man. Fundamental to an objective theory of values is the 
question: Of value to whom and for what? An objective 
theory does not permit context-dropping or “concept- 
stealing”; it does not permit the separation of “value” from 
“purpose,” of the good from beneficiaries, and of man's 
actions from reason. 

Of all the social systems in mankind’s history, capitalism is 
the only system based on an objective theory of values. 

The intrinsic theory and the subjectivist theory (or a mix- 
ture of both) are the necessary base of every dictatorship, 
tyranny, or variant of the absolute state. Whether they are 
held consciously or subconsciously — in the explicit form of 
a philosopher’s treatise or in the implicit chaos of its echoes in 
an average man’s feelings — these theories make it possible 
for a man to believe that the good is independent of man’s 
mind and can be achieved by physical force. 

If a man believes that the good is intrinsic in certain 
actions, he will not hesitate to force others to perform them. 
If he believes that the human benefit or injury caused by 
such actions is of no significance, be will regard a sea of 
blood as of no significance. If he believes that the benefici- 
aries of such actions are irrelevant (or interchangeable), he 
will regard wholesale slaughter as his moral duty in the 
service of a “higher” good. It is the intrinsic theory of values 
that produces a Robespierre, a Lenin, a Stalin, or a Hitler. It 
is not an accident that Eichmann was a Kantian. 

If a man believes that the good is a matter of arbitrary, 
subjective choice, the issue of good or evil becomes, for him, 
an issue of: my feelings or theirs? No bridge, understanding, 
or communication is possible to him. Reason is the only 
means of communication among men, and an objectively 



What Is Capitalism? 23 

perceivable reality is their only common frame of reference; 
when these are invalidated (i.e., held to be irrelevant) in the 
field of morality, force becomes men’s only way of dealing 
with one another. If the subjectivist wants to pursue some 
social ideal of his own, he feels morally entitled to force men 
“for their own good,” since he feels that he is right and that 
there is nothing to oppose him but their misguided feelings. 

Thus, in practice, the proponents of the intrinsic and the 
subjectivist schools meet and blend. (They blend in terms of 
their psycho-epistemology as well: by what means do the 
moralists of the intrinsic school discover their transcendental 
“good,” if not by means of special, non-rational intuitions 
and revelations, i.e., by means of their feelings?) It is doubt- 
ful whether anyone can hold either of these theories as an 
actual, if mistaken, conviction. But both serve as a rationaliza- 
tion of power-lust and of rule by brute force, unleashing the 
potential dictator and disarming his victims. 

The objective theory of values is the only moral theory 
incompatible with rule by force. Capitalism is the only system 
based implicitly on an objective theory of values — and the 
historic tragedy is that this has never been made explicit 

If one knows that the good is objective — i.e., determined 
by the nature of reality, but to be discovered by man’s 
mind — one knows that an attempt to achieve the good by 
physical force is a monstrous contradiction which negates 
morality at its root by destroying man’s capacity to recognize 
the good, i.e. t his capacity to value. Force invalidates and 
paralyzes a man’s judgment, demanding that be act against it, 
thus rendering him morally impotent A value which one is 
forced to accept at the price of surrendering one’s mind, is - 
not a value to anyone; the forcibly mindless can neither judge 
nor choose nor value. An attempt to achieve the gocil by 
force is like an attempt to provide a man with a picture 
gallery at the price of cutting out his eyes. Values cannot 
exist (cannot be valued) outside the full context of a man’s 
life, needs, goals, and knowledge. 

The objective view of values permeates the entire structure 
of a capitalist society. 

The recognition of individual rights implies the recognition 
of the fact that the good is not an ineffable abstraction in 
some supernatural dimension, but a value pertaining to reali- 
ty, to this earth, to the lives of individual human beings (note 
the right to the pursuit of happiness). It implies that the good 
cannot be divorced from beneficiaries, that men are not to be 
regarded as interchangeable, and that no man or tribe may 
attempt to achieve the good of some at the price of the

immolation of others. 

The free market represents the social application of an 
objective theory of values. Since values are to be discovered 
by man’s mind, men must be free to discover them — to 
thi nk , to study, to translate their knowledge into physical 
form, to offer their products for trade, to judge them, and to 
choose, be it material goods or ideas, a loaf of bread or a 
philosophical treatise. Since values arc established contextual- 
ly, every man must judge for himself, in the context of his 
own knowledge, goals, and interests. Since values are deter- 
mined by the nature of reality, it is reality that serves as 
men’s ultimate arbiter: if a man’s judgment is right, the 
rewards are his; if it is wrong, he is his only victim. 

It is in regard to a free market that the distinction between 
an intrinsic, subjective, and objective view of values is partic- 
ularly important to understand. The market value of a prod- 
uct is not an intrinsic value, not a “value in itself* hanging 
in a vacuum. A free market never loses sight of the question: 
Of value to whom ? And, within the broad field of objectivity, 
the market value of a product does not reflect its philosoph- 
ically objective value, but only its socially objective value. 

By “philosophically objective,*' I mean a value estimated 
from the standpoint of the best possible to man, i.e ., by the 
criterion of the most rational mind possessing the greatest 
knowledge, in a given category, in a given period, and in a 
defined context (nothing can be estimated in an undefined 
context). For instance, it can be rationally proved that the 
airplane is objectively of immeasurably greater value to man 
(to man at his best ) than the bicycle— and that the works of 
Victor Hugo are objectively of immeasurably greater value 
than true-confession magazines. But if a given man’s intellec- 
tual potential can barely manage to enjoy true confessions, 
there is no reason why his meager earnings, the product of 
his effort, should be spent on books he cannot read— or on 
subsidizing the airplane industry, if his own transportation 
needs do not extend beyond the range of a bicycle. (Nor is 
there any reason why the rest of mankind should be held 
down to the level of his literary taste, his engineering capaci- 
ty, and his income. Values are not determined by fiat nor by 
majority vote.) 

Just as the number of its adherents is not a proof of an 
idea’s truth or falsehood, of an art work’s merit or demerit, 
of a product’s efficacy or inefficacy — so the free-market 
value of goods or services does not necessarily represent their 
philosophically objective value, but only their socially objec- 
tive value, i.e., the sum of the individual judgments of all the

the majority have barely assimilated the value of the automo- 
bile, the creative minority introduces the airplane. The majority 
learn by demonstration, the minority is free to demon- 
strate. The “philosophically objective” value of a new prod- 
uct serves as the teacher for those who are willing to 
exercise their rational faculty, each to the extent of his 
ability. Those who are unwilling remain unrewarded — as well 
as those who aspire to more than their ability produces. The 
stagnant, the irrational, the subjectivist have no power to stop 
their betters. 

(The small minority of adults who are unable rather than 
unwilling to work, have to rely on voluntary charity; misfor- 
tune is not a claim to slave labor; there is no such thing as 
the right to consume, control, and destroy those without 
whom one would be unable to survive. As to depressions and 
mass unemployment, they are not caused by the free market, 
but by government interference into the economy.) 

The mental parasites — the imitators who attempt to cater 
to what they t hink is the public’s known taste — are constantly 
being beaten by the innovators whose products raise the 
public’s knowledge and taste to ever higher levels. It is in this 
sense that the free market is ruled, not by the consumers, but 
by the producers. The most successful ones are those who 
discover new fields of production, fields which had not been 
known to exist 

A given product may not be appreciated at once, particu- 
larly if it is too radical an innovation; but, barring irrelevant 
accidents, it wins in the long run. It is in this sense that the 
free market is not ruled by the intellectual criteria of the 
majority, which prevail only at and for any given moment; 
the free market is ruled by those who are able to see and 
plan long-range — and the better the mind, the longer the 
range. 

The economic value of a man’s work is determined, on a 
free market, by a single principle: by the voluntary consent 
of those who are willing to trade him their work or products 
in return. This is the moral meaning of the law of supply and 
demand; it represents the total rejection of two vicious doc- 
trines: the tribal premise and altruism. It represents the 
recognition of the fact that man is not the property nor the 
servant of the tribe, that a man works in order to support his 
own life — as, by his nature, he must — that he has to be 
guided by his own rational self-interest, and if he wants to 
trade with others, he cannot expect sacrificial victims, i.e. t he 
cannot expect to receive values without trading commensur- 
ate values in return. The sole criterion of what is commen- 



What Is Capitalism? 27 

surate, in this context, is the free, voluntary, uncoerced 
judgment of the traders. 

The tribal mentalities attack this principle from two seem- 
ingly opposite sides: they claim that the free market is 
“unfair" both to the genius and to the average man. The first 
objection is usually expressed by a question such as: “Why 
should Elvis Presley make more money than Einstein?” The 
answer is: Because men work in order to support and enjoy 
their own lives — and if many men find value in Elvis Presley, 
they are entitled to spend their money on their own pleasure. 
Presley’s fortune is not taken from those who do not care for 
his work (I am one of them) nor from Einstein — nor does 
he stand in Einstein’s way — nor does Einstein lack proper 
recognition and support in a free society, on an appropriate 
intellectual level. 

As to the second objection, the claim that a man of 
average ability suffers an “unfair” disadvantage on a free 
market — 

Look past the range of the moment, you who cry that 
you fear to compete with men of superior intelligence, 
that their mind is a threat to your livelihood, that the 
strong leave no chance to the weak in a market of 
voluntary trade. . . . When you live in a rational soci- 
ety, where men are free to trade, you receive an 
incalculable bonus: the material value of your work is 
determined not only by your effort, but by the effort of 
the best productive minds who exist in the world 
around you. . . . 

The machine, the frozen form of a living intelli- 
gence, is the power that expands the potential of your 
life by raising the productivity of your time. . . . Every 
man is free to rise as far as he’s able or willing, but it’s 
only the degree to which he thinks that determines the 
degree to which he’ll rise. Physical labor as such can 
extend no further than the range of the moment The 
man who does no more than physical labor, consumes 
the material value-equivalent of his own contribution to 
the process of production, and leaves no further value, 
neither for himself nor others. But the man who pro- 
duces an idea in any field of rational endeavor — the 
man who discovers new knowledge — is the permanent 
benefactor of humanity. ... It is only the value of an 
idea that can be shared with unlimited numbers of 
men, making all sharers richer at no one’s sacrifice or 
loss, raising the productive capacity of whatever labor 
they perform. . . . 



28 


Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal 

In proportion to the mental energy he spent, the man 
who creates a new invention receives but a small per- 
centage of his value in terms of material payment, no 
matter what fortune he makes, no matter what millions 
he earns. But the man who works as a janitor in the 
factory producing that invention, receives an enormous 
payment in proportion to the mental effort that his job 
requires of him. And the same is true of all men 
between, on all levels of ambition and ability. The man 
at the top of the intellectual pyramid contributes the 
most to all those below him, but gets nothing except his 
material payment, receiving no intellectual bonus from 
others to add to the value of his time. The man at the 
bottom who, left to himself, would starve in his 
hopeless ineptitude, contributes nothing to those above 
him, but receives the bonus of all of their brains. Such 
is the nature of the "competition” between the strong 
and the weak of the intellect. Such is the pattern of 
"exploitation’’ for which you have damned the strong. 

C Atlas Shrugged ) 

And such is the relationship of capitalism to man’s mind 
and to man’s survival. 

The magnificent progress achieved by capitalism in a brief 
span of time — the spectacular improvement in the conditions 
of man’s existence on earth — is a matter of historical record. 
It is not to be hidden, evaded, or explained away by all the 
propaganda of capitalism’s enemies. But what needs special 
emphasis is the fact that this progress was achieved by 
non-sacrificial means. 

Progress cannot be achieved by forced privations, by 
squeezing a "social surplus” out of starving victims. Progress 
can come only out of individual surplus , i.e., from the work, 
the energy, the creative over-abundance of those men whose 
ability produces more than their personal consumption re- 
quires, those who are intellectually and financially able to 
seek the new, to improve on the known, to move forward. In 
a capitalist society, where such men are free to function and 
to take their own risks, progress is not a matter of sacrificing 
to some distant future, it is part of the living present, it is the 
normal and natural, it is achieved as and while men live — 
and enjoy — their lives. 

Now consider the alternative — the tribal society, where all 
men throw their efforts, values, ambitions, and goals into a 
tribal pool or common pot, then wait hungrily at its rim, 
while the leader of a clique of cooks stirs it with a bayonet in 
one hand and a blank check on all their lives in the other. 



What Is Capitalism? 29 

The most consistent example of such a system is the Union of 
Soviet Socialist Republics. 

Half a century ago, the Soviet rulers commanded their 
subjects to be patient, bear privations, and make sacrifices for 
the sake of "industrializing” the country, promising that this 
was only temporary, that industrialization would bring them 
abundance, and Soviet progress would surpass the capitalistic 
West. 

Today, Soviet Russia is still unable to feed her people — 
while the rulers scramble to copy, borrow, or steal the 
technological achievements of the West. Industrialization is 
not a static goal; it is a dynamic process with a rapid rate of 
obsolescence. So the wretched serfs of a planned tribal 
economy, who starved while waiting for electric generators 
and tractors, are now starving while waiting for atomic 
power and interplanetary travel. Thus, in a "people’s state,” 
the progress of science is a threat to the people, and every 
advance is taken out of the people’s shrinking hides. 

This was not the history of capitalism. 

America’s abundance was not created by public sacrifices 
to “the common good,” but by the productive genius of free 
men who pursued their own personal interests and the mak- 
ing of their own private fortunes. They did not starve the 
people to pay for America’s industrialization. They gave the 
people better jobs, higher wages, and cheaper goods with 
every new machine they invented, with every scientific dis- 
covery or technological advance — and thus the whole country 
was moving forward and profiting, not suffering, every step 
l of the way. 

I iot, however, make the error of reversing cause and 
the good of the country was made possible precisely 
fact that it was not forced on anyone as a moral goal 
; it was merely an effect; the cause was a man’s right 
ue his own good. It is this right — not its consequences 
represents the moral justification of capitalism, 
this right is incompatible with the intrinsic or the 
vist theory of values, with the altruist morality and 
•al premise. It is obvious which human attribute one 
when one rejects objectivity; and, in view of capital- 
;cord, it is obvious against which human attribute the 
morality and the tribal premise stand united: against 
nind, against intelligence — particularly against intelli- 
ipplied to the problems of human survival, i.e., pro- 
ability. 

e altruism seeks to rob intelligence of its rewards, by 
g that the moral duty of the competent is to serve the 



30 Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal 

incompetent and sacrifice themselves to anyone’s need — the 
tribal premise goes a step further: it denies the existence of 
intelligence and of its role in the production of wealth. 

It is morally obscene to regard wealth as an anonymous, 
tribal product and to talk about “redistributing” it. The view 
that wealth is the result of some undifferentiated, collective 
process, that we all did something and it’s impossible to tell 
who did what, therefore some sort of equalitarian “distribu- 
tion” is necessary — might have been appropriate in a primor- 
dial jungle with a savage horde moving boulders by crude 
physical labor (though even there someone had to initiate 
and organize the moving). To hold that view in an industrial 
society — where individual achievements are a matter of pub- 
lic record — is so crass an evasion that even to give it the 
benefit of the doubt is an obscenity. 

Anyone who has ever been an employer or an employee, 
or has observed men working, or has done an honest day’s 
work himself, knows the crucial role of ability, of intelli- 
gence, of a focused, competent mind — in any and all lines of 
work, from the lowest to the highest. He knows that ability 
or the lack of it (whether the lack is actual or volitional) 
makes a difference of life-or-death in any productive process. 
The evidence is so overwhelming — theoretically and practi- 
cally, logically and “empirically,” in the events of history 
and in anyone’s own daily grind — that no one can claim 
ignorance of it. Mistakes of this size are not made inno- 
cently. 

When great industrialists made fortunes on a free market 
(/.e., without the use of force, without government assistance 
or interference), they created new wealth — they did not take 
it from those who had not created it. If you doubt it, take a 
look at the “total social product” — and the standard of liv- 
ing — of those countries where such men are not permitted to 
exist. 

Observe how seldom and how inadequately the issue of 
human intelligence is discussed in the writings of the tribal- 
statist-altruist theoreticians. Observe how carefully today’s 
advocates of a mixed economy avoid and evade any mention 
of intelligence or ability in their approach to politico-eco- 
nomic issues, in their claims, demands, and pressure-group 
warfare over the looting of “the total social product.” 

It is often asked: Why was capitalism destroyed in spite of 
its incomparably beneficent record? The answer lies in the 
fact that the lifeline feeding any social system is a culture’s 
dominant philosophy and that capitalism never had a philo- 
sophical base. It was the last and (theoretically) incomplete 



31 


What Is Capitalism? 

product of an Aristotelian influence. As a resurgent tide of 
mysticism engulfed philosophy in the nineteenth century, cap- 
italism was left in an intellectual vacuum, its lifeline cut. 
Neither its moral nature nor even its political principles had 
ever been fully understood or defined. Its alleged defenders 
regarded it as compatible with government controls ( i.e ., 
government interference into the economy), ignoring the 
meaning and implications of the concept of laissez-faire. 
Thus, what existed in practice, in the nineteenth century, was 
not pure capitalism, but variously mixed economies. Since 
controls necessitate and breed further controls, it was the 
statist clement of the mixtures that wrecked them; it was the 
free, capitalist element that took the blame. 

Capitalism could not survive in a culture dominated by 
mysticism and altruism, by the soul-body dichotomy and the 
tribal premise. No social system (and no human institution or 
activity of any kind) can survive without a moral base. On 
the basis of the altruist morality, capitalism had to be — and 
was — damned from the start 5 

For those who do not fully understand the role of philoso- 
phy in politico-economic issues, I offer — as the clearest ex- 
ample of today’s intellectual state — some further quotations 
from the Encyclopaedia Britannica’s article on capitalism. 

Few observers are inclined to find fault with capitalism 
as an engine of production. Criticism usually proceeds 
either from moral or cultural disapproval of certain 
features of the capitalist system, or from the short-run 
vicissitudes (crises and depressions) with which long- 
run improvement is interspersed. [Italics mine.] 

The "crises and depressions” were caused by government 
interference, not by the capitalist system. But what was the 
nature of the "moral or cultural disapproval”? The article 
does not tell us explicitly, but gives one eloquent indica- 
tion: 

Such as they were, however, both tendencies and reali- 
zations [of capitalism] bear the unmistakable stamp of 
the businessman’s interests and still more the business- 
man’s type of mind. Moreover it was not only policy 
but the philosophy of national and individual life, the 
scheme of cultural values, that bore that stamp. Its 
materialistic utilitarianism, its naive confidence in prog-

ress of a certain type, its actual achievements in the 
field of pure and applied science, the temper of its 
artistic creations, may all be traced to the spirit of 
rationalism that emanates from the businessman’s 
office. [Italics mine.) 

The author of the article, who is not “naive" enough to 
believe in a capitalistic (or rational) type of progress, holds, 
apparently, a different belief: 

At the end of the middle ages western Europe stood 
about where many underdeveloped countries stand in 
the 20th century. (This means that the culture of the 
Renaissance was about the equivalent of today’s Con- 
go; or else, it means that people’s intellectual develop- 
ment has nothing to do with economics.] In underdevel- 
oped economies the difficult task of statesmanship is to 
get under way a cumulative process of economic develop- 
ment, for once a certain momentum is attained, further 
advances appear to follow more or less automatically. 

Some such notion underlies every theory of a planned 
economy. It is on some such “sophisticated’’ belief that two 
generations of Russians have perished, waiting for automatic 
progress. 

The classical economists attempted a tribal justification of 
capitalism on the ground that it provides the best “alloca- 
tion" of a community’s “resources.” Here are their chickens 
coming home to roost: 

The market theory of resource allocation within the 
private sector is the central theme of classical econom- 
ics. The criterion for allocation between the public and 
private sectors is formally the same as in any other 
resource allocation, namely that the community should 
receive equal satisfaction from a marginal increment of 
resources used in the public and private spheres. . . . 
Many economists have asserted that there is substan- 
tial, perhaps overwhelming, evidence that total welfare 
in capitalist United States, for example, would be in- 
creased by a reallocation of resources to the public 
sector — more schoolrooms and fewer shopping centers, 
more public libraries and fewer automobiles, more hos- 
pitals and fewer bowling alleys. 

This means that some men must toil all their lives without 
adequate transportation (automobiles), without an adequate 
number of places to buy the goods they need (shopping 



33

centers), without the pleasures of relaxation (bowling alleys) 
— in order that other men may be provided with schools, 
libraries, and hospitals. 

If you want to see the ultimate results and full meaning of 
the tribal view of wealth — the total obliteration of the dis- 
tinction between private action and government action, be- 
tween production and force, the total obliteration of the 
concept of “rights," of an individual human being’s reality, 
and its replacement by a view of men as interchangeable 
beasts of burden or “factors of production" — study the fol- 
lowing: 

Capitalism has a bias against the public sector for two 
reasons. First, all products and income accrue [7] 
initially to the private sector while resources reach the 
public sector through the painful process of taxation. 
Public needs are met only by sufferance of consumers 
in their role as taxpayers [what about producers?], 
whose political representatives are acutely conscious of 
their constituents’ tender feelings [!J about taxation. 
That people know better than governments what to do 
with their income is a notion more appealing than the 
contrary one, that people get more for their tax money 
than for other types of spending. [By what theory of 
values? By whose judgment?] . . . 

Second, the pressure of private business to sell leads 
to the formidable array of devices of modern salesman- 
ship which influence consumer choice and bias con- 
sumer values toward private consumption . . . [This 
means that your desire to spend the money you earn 
rather than have it taken away from you, is a mere 
bias.] Hence, much private expenditure goes for wants 
that arc not very urgent in any fundamental sense. 
[Urgent — to whom? Which wants are “fundamental," 
beyond a cave, a bearskin, and a chunk of raw meat7] 
The corollary is that many public needs are neglected 
because these superficial private wants, artificially gen- 
erated, compete successfully for the same resources. 
[Whose resources?] . . . 

A comparison of resource allocation to the public 
and private sectors under capitalism and under socialist 
collectivism is illuminating. [It is.] In a collective 
economy all resources operate in the public sector and 
are available for education, defense, health, welfare, 
and other public needs without any transfer through 
taxation. Private consumption is restricted to the claims 
that are permitted [by whom?] against the social prod- 
uct, much as public services in a capitalist economy

Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal 

are limited to the claims permitted against the private 
sector. [Italics mine.] In a collective economy public 
needs enjoy the same sort of built-in priority that 
private consumption enjoys in a capitalist economy. In 
the Soviet Union teachers are plentiful, but automobiles 
are scarce, whereas the opposite condition prevails in 
the United States. 

Here is the conclusion of that article: 

Predictions concerning the survival of capitalism are, in 
part, a matter of definition. One sees everywhere in 
capitalist countries a shifting of economic activity from 
the private to the public sphere. ... At the same time 
[after World War U] private consumption appeared 
destined to increase in communist countries. [Such as 
the consumption of wheat?] The two economic systems 
seemed to be drawing closer together by changes con- 
verging from both directions. Yet significant differences 
in the economic structures still existed. It seemed rea- 
sonable to assume that the society which invested more 
in people would advance more rapidly and inherit the 
future. In this important respect capitalism, in the eyes 
of some economists, labours under a fundamental but 
not inescapable disadvantage in competition with col- 
lectivism. 

The collectivization of Soviet agriculture was achieved by 
means of a government-planned famine — planned and car- 
ried out deliberately to force peasants into collective farms; 
Soviet Russia’s enemies claim that fifteen million peasants 
died in that famine; the Soviet government admits the death 
of seven million. 

At the end of World War n, Soviet Russia’s enemies 
claimed that thirty million people were doing forced labor in 
Soviet concentration camps (and were dying of planned mal- 
nutrition, human lives being cheaper than food); Soviet Rus- 
sia’s apologists admit to the figure of twelve million people. 

This is what the Encyclopaedia Britannica refers to as 
“investment in people.” 

In a culture where such a statement is made with intellec- 
tual impunity and with an aura of moral righteousness, the 
guiltiest men are not the collectivists; the guiltiest men are 
those who, lacking the courage to challenge mysticism or 
altruism, attempt to bypass the issues of reason and morality 
and to defend the only rational and moral system in man- 
kind’s history — capitalism — on any grounds other than ra- 
tional and moral.
