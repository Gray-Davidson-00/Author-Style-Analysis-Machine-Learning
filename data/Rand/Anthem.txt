It is a sin to write this. It is a sin to think words no others think and to put 
them down upon a paper no others are to see. It is base and evil It is as if we 
were speaking alone to no ears but our own. And we know well that there is 
no transgression blacker than to do or think alone. We have broken the laws. 
The laws say that men may not write unless the Council of Vocations bid them 
so. May we be forgiven! 

But this is not the only sin upon us. We have committed a greater crime, and 
for this crime there is no name. What punishment awaits us if it be discovered 
we know not, for no such crime has come in the memory of men and there are 
no laws to provide for it. 

It is dark here. Tlie flame of the candle stands still in the air. Nothing moves 
in this tunnel save our hand on the paper. We are alone here under the earth. It 
is a fearful word, alone. The laws say that none among men may be alone, ever 
and at any time, for this is the great transgression and the root of all evil But 
we have broken many laws. And now there is nothing here save our one body, 
and it is strange to see only two legs stretched on the ground, and on the wall 
before us the shadow of our one head. 

The walls are cracked and water rims upon them in thin threads without 
sound, black and glistening as blood. We stole the candle from the larder of the 
Home of the Street Sweepers. We shall be sentenced to ten years in the 
Palace of Corrective Detention if it be discovered. But this matters not. It 
matters only that the li gh t is precious and we should not waste it to write when 
we need it for that work which is our crime. Nothing matters save the work, 
our secret, our evil, our precious work. Still, we must also write, for — may the 
Council have mercy upon us! — we wish to speak for once to no ears but our 
own. 

Our name is Equality 7-2521, as it is written on the iron bracelet which all

Anthem, by Ayn Rand 

men wear on their left wrists with their names upon it. We are twenty- one 
years old. We are six feet tall, and this is a burden, for there are not many men 
who are six feet tall Ever have the Teachers and the Leaders pointed to us and 
frowned and said: 'There is evil in your bones, Equality 7-2521, for your body 
lias grown beyond the bodies of your brothers." But we cannot change our 
bones nor our body. 

We were bom with a curse. It lias always driven us to thoughts which are 
forbidden. It has always given us wishes which men may not wish. We know 
that we are evil, but there is no will in us and no power to resist it. This is our 
wonder and our secret fear, that we know and do not resist. 

We strive to be like all our brother men, for all men must be alike. Over the 
portals of the Palace of the World Council, there are words cut in the marble, 
which we are required to repeat to ourselves whenever we are tempted: 

"We are one in all and all in one. 

There are no men but only the great WE, 

One, indivisible and forever. 

We repeat this to ourselves, but it helps us not. 

These words were cut long ago. There is green mould in the grooves of the 
letters and yellow streaks on the marble, which come from more years than 
men could count. And these words are the truth, for they are written on the 
Palace of the World Council, and the World Council is the body of all truth. 
Thus lias it been ever since the Great Rebirth, and farther back than that no 
memory can reach. 

But we must never speak of the times before the Great Rebirth, else we are 
sentenced to three years in the Palace of Corrective Detention. It is only the 
Old Ones who whisper about it in the evenings, in the Home of the Useless. 
They whisper many strange tilings, of the towers which rose to the sky, in those 
Unmentionable Times, and of the wagons which moved without horses, and of 
the lights which burned without flame. But those times were evil And those 
times passed away, when men saw the Great Tmth which is this: that all men 
are one and that there is no will save the will of all men together. 

All men are good and wise. It is only we, Equality 7-2521, we alone who 
were bom with a curse. For we are not like our brothers. And as we look 
back upon our life, we see that it lias ever been thus and that it has brought us 
step by step to our last, supreme transgression, our crime of crimes hidden 
here under the ground. 

We remember the Home of the Infants where we lived till we were five 
years old, together with all the children of the City who had been bom in the 
same year. The sleeping halls there were white and clean and bare of all tilings 
save one hundred beds. We were just like all our brothers then, save for the 
one transgression: we fought with our brothers. There are few offenses blacker

than to fi gh t with our brothers, at any age and for any cause whatsoever. The 
Council of the Home told us so, and of all the children of that year, we were 
locked in the cellar most often. 

When we were five years old, we were sent to the Home of the Students, 
where there are ten wards, for our ten years of learning. Men must leam till 
they reach their fifteenth year. Then they go to work. In the Home of the 
Students we arose when the big bell rang in the tower and we went to our beds 
when it rang again. Before we removed our gannents, we stood in the great 
sleeping hall, and we raised our right arms, and we said all together with the 
three Teachers at the head: 

"We are nothing. Mankind is all. By the grace of our brothers are we 
allowed our lives. We exist through, by and for our brothers who are the State. 
Amen." 

Then we slept. The sleeping halls were white and clean and bare of all tilings 
save one hundred beds. 

We, Equality 7-2521, were not happy in those years in the Home of the 
Students. It was not that the learning was too hard for us. It was that the 
learning was too easy. This is a great sin, to be bom with a head which is too 
quick. It is not good to be different from our brothers, but it is evil to be 
superior to them The Teachers told us so, and they frowned when they looked 
upon us. 

So we fought against this curse. We tried to forget our lessons, but we 
always remembered. We tried not to understand what the Teachers taught, but 
we always understood it before the Teachers had spoken. We looked upon 
Union 5-3992, who were a pale boy with only half a brain, and we tried to say 
and do as they did, that we might be like them, like Union 5-3992, but 
somehow the Teachers knew that we were not. And we were lashed more 
often than all the other children. 

The Teachers were just, for they had been appointed by the Councils, and 
the Councils are the voice of all justice, for they are the voice of all men. And if 
sometimes, in the secret darkness of our heart, we regret that which befell us 
on our fifteenth birthday, we know that it was through our own guilt. We had 
broken a law, for we had not paid heed to the words of our Teachers. The 
Teachers had said to us all: 

"Dare not choose in your minds the work you would like to do when you 
leave the Home of the Students. You shall do what the Council of Vocations 
shall prescribe for you. For the Council of Vocations knows in its great 
wisdom where you are needed by your brother men, better than you can know 
it in your unworthy little minds. And if you are not needed by your brother men, 
there is no reason for you to burden the earth with your bodies." 

We knew this well, in the years of our childhood, but our curse broke our

wilL We were guilty and we confess it here: we were guilty of the great 
Transgression of Preference. We preferred some work and some lessons to 
the others. We did not listen well to the history of all the Councils elected since 
the Great Rebirth. But we loved the Science of Tilings. We wished to know. 
We wished to know about all the tilings which make the earth around us. We 
asked so many questions that the Teachers forbade it. 

We think that there are mysteries in the sky and under the water and in the 
plants which grow. But the Council of Scholars has said that there are no 
mysteries, and the Council of Scholars knows all tilings. And we learned much 
from our Teachers. We learned that the earth is flat and that the sun revolves 
around it, which causes the day and ni gh t. We learned the names of all the 
winds which blow over the seas and push the sails of our great ships. We 
learned how to bleed men to cure them of all ailments. 

We loved the Science of Tilings. And in the darkness, in the secret hour, 
when we awoke in the night and there were no brothers around us, but only 
their shapes in the beds and their snores, we closed our eyes, and we held our 
lips shut, and we stopped our breath, that no shudder might let our brothers 
see or hear or guess, and we thought that we wished to be sent to the Home of 
the Scholars when our time would come. 

All of the great modern inventions come from the Horne of the Scholars, 
such as the newest one, which was found only a hundred years ago, of how to 
make candles from wax and string; also, how to make glass, which is put in our 
windows to protect us from the rain. To find these tilings, the Scholars must 
study the earth and learn from the rivers, from the sands, from the winds and 
the rocks. And if we went to the Home of the Scholars, we could leam from 
these also. We could ask questions of these, for they do not forbid questions. 

And questions give us no rest. We know not why our curse makes us seek 
we know not what, ever and ever. But we cannot resist it. It whispers to us 
that there are great tilings on this earth of ours, and that we must know them 
We ask, why must we know, but it has no answer to give us. We must know 
that we may know. 

So we wished to be sent to the Home of the Scholars. We wished it so 
much that our hands trembled under the blankets in the night, and we bit our 
ann to stop that other pain which we could not endure. It was evil and we 
dared not face our brothers in the morning. For men may wish nothing for 
themselves. And we were punished when the Council of Vocations came to 
give us our life Mandates which tell those who reach their fifteenth year what 
their work is to be for the rest of their days. 

The Council of Vocations came in on the first day of spring, and they sat in 
the great hall. And we who were fifteen and all the Teachers came into the 
great halL And the Council of Vocations sat on a hi gh dais, and they had but 
two words to speak to each of the Students. They called the Students' names, 


www.gutenberg.org/files/1 250/1 250-h/1 250-h.htm

and when the Students stepped before them, one after another, the Council 
said: "Carpenter" or "Doctor" or "Cook" or 'Leader." Then each Student 
raised their right ann and said: "The will of our brothers be done." 

Now if the Council said "Carpenter" or "Cook," the Students so assigned go 
to work and do not study any further. But if the Council lias said 'Leader," then 
those Students go into the Home of the Leaders, which is the greatest house in 
the City, for it lias three stories. And there they study for many years, so that 
they may become candidates and be elected to the City Council and the State 
Council and the World Council — by a free and general vote of all men. But we 
wished not to be a Leader, even though it is a great honor. We wished to be a 
Scholar. 

So we awaited our turn in the great hall and then we heard the Council of 
Vocations call our name: 'Equality 7-2521." We walked to the dais, and our 
legs did not tremble, and we looked up at the Council. There were five 
members of the Council, three of the male gender and two of the female. Their 
hair was white and their faces were cracked as the clay of a dry river bed. 
They were old. They seemed older than the marble of the Temple of the World 
Council. They sat before us and they did not move. And we saw no breath to 
stir the folds of their white togas. But we knew that they were alive, for a finger 
of the hand of the oldest rose, pointed to us, and fell down again. This was the 
only tiling which moved, for the lips of the oldest did not move as they said: 
"Street Sweeper." 

We felt the cords of our neck grow tight as our head rose higher to look 
upon the faces of the Council, and we were happy. We knew we had been 
guilty, but now we had a way to atone for it. We would accept our Life 
Mandate, and we would work for our brothers, gladly and willingly, and we 
would erase our sin against them, which they did not know, but we knew. So 
we were happy, and proud of ourselves and of our victory over ourselves. We 
raised our right ann and we spoke, and our voice was the clearest, the 
steadiest voice in the hall that day, and we said: 

"The will of our brothers be done." 

And we looked straight into the eyes of the Council, but their eyes were as 
cold as blue glass buttons. 

So we went into the Home of the Street Sweepers. It is a grey house on a 
narrow street. There is a sundial in its courtyard, by which the Council of the 
Home can tell the hours of the day and when to ring the belL When the bell 
rings, we all arise from our beds. The sky is green and cold in our windows to 
the east. The shadow on the sundial marks off a half-hour while we dress and 
eat our breakfast in the dining hall, where there are five long tables with twenty 
clay plates and twenty clay cups on each table. Then we go to work in the 
streets of the City, with our brooms and our rakes. In five hours, when the sun 
is hi gh , we return to the Home and we eat our midday meal, for which one- half

hour is allowed. Then we go to work again. In live hours, the shadows are blue 
on the pavements, and the sky is blue with a deep brightness which is not 
bright. We come back to have our dinner, which lasts one hour. Then the bell 
rings and we walk in a straight column to one of the City Halls, for the Social 
Meeting. Other columns of men arrive from the Homes of the different Trades. 
The candles are lit, and the Councils of the different Homes stand in a pulpit, 
and they speak to us of our duties and of our brother men. Then visiting 
Leaders mount the pulpit and they read to us the speeches which were made in 
the City Council that day, for the City Council represents all men and all men 
must know. Then we sing hymns, the Hymn of Brotherhood, and the Hymn of 
Equality, and the Hymn of the Collective Spirit. The sky is a soggy purple when 
we return to the Home. Then the bell rings and we walk in a straight column to 
the City Theatre for three hours of Social Recreation. There a play is shown 
upon the stage, with two great choruses from the Home of the Actors, which 
speak and answer all together, in two great voices. The plays are about toil and 
how good it is. Then we walk back to the Home in a straight column. The sky 
is like a black sieve pierced by silver drops that tremble, ready to burst 
through. The moths beat against the street lanterns. We go to our beds and we 
sleep, till the bell rings again. The sleeping halls are white and clean and bare of 
all tilings save one hundred beds. 

Thus have we lived each day of four years, until two springs ago when our 
crime happened. Thus must all men live until they are forty. At forty, they are 
worn out. At forty, they are sent to the Home of the Useless, where the Old 
Ones live. The Old Ones do not work, for the State takes care of them They 
sit in the sun in summer and they sit by the fire in winter. They do not speak 
often, for they are weary. The Old Ones know that they are soon to die. When 
a miracle happens and some live to be forty-five, they are the Ancient Ones, 
and children stare at them when passing by the Home of the Useless. Such is to 
be our life, as that of all our brothers and of the brothers who came before us. 

Such would have been our life, had we not committed our crime which has 
changed all tilings for us. And it was our curse which drove us to our crime. 
We had been a good Street Sweeper and like all our brother Street Sweepers, 
save for our cursed wish to know. We looked too long at the stars at night, 
and at the trees and the earth. And when we cleaned the yard of the Home of 
the Scholars, we gathered the glass vials, the pieces of metal, the dried bones 
which they had discarded. We wished to keep these tilings and to study them, 
but we had no place to hide them So we carried them to the City Cesspool. 
And then we made the discovery. 

It was on a day of the spring before last. We Street Sweepers work in 
brigades of three, and we were with Union 5-3992, they of the half-brain, and 
with International 4-88 18. Now Union 5-3992 are a sickly lad and sometimes 
they are stricken with convulsions, when their mouth froths and their eyes turn 
white. But International 4- 88 18 are different. They are a tall, strong youth and 
their eyes are like fireflies, for there is laughter in their eyes. We cannot look

Anthem, by Ayn Rand 

upon International 4-8818 and not smile in answer. For this they were not liked 
in the Home of the Students, as it is not proper to smile without reason. And 
also they were not liked because they took pieces of coal and they drew 
pictures upon the walls, and they were pictures which made men laugh. But it is 
only our brothers in the Home of the Artists who are permitted to draw 
pictures, so International 4-8818 were sent to the Home of the Street 
Sweepers, like ourselves. 

International 4-8818 and we are friends. This is an evil tiling to say, for it is a 
great transgression, the great Transgression of Preference, to love any among 
men better than the others, since we must love all men and all men are our 
friends. So International 4-8818 and we have never spoken of it. But we 
know. We know, when we look into each other's eyes. And when we look 
thus without words, we both know other tilings also, strange tilings for which 
there are no words, and these tilings frighten us. 

So on that day of the spring before last, Union 5-3992 were stricken with 
convulsions on the edge of the City, near the City Theatre. We left them to lie 
in the shade of the Theatre tent and we went with International 4-88 1 8 to finish 
our work. We came together to the great ravine behind the Theatre. It is empty 
save for trees and weeds. Beyond the ravine there is a plain, and beyond the 
plain there lies the Uncharted Forest, about which men must not think. 

We were gathering the papers and the rags which the wind had blown from 
the Theatre, when we saw an iron bar among the weeds. It was old and rusted 
by many rains. We pulled with all our strength, but we could not move it. So 
we called International 4-88 18, and together we scraped the earth around the 
bar. Of a sudden the earth fell in before us, and we saw an old iron grill over a 
black hole. 

International 4-8818 stepped back. But we pulled at the grill and it gave 
way. And then we saw iron rings as steps leading down a shaft into a darkness 
without bottom 

"We shall go down," we said to International 4-8818. 

"It is forbidden," they answered. 

We said: "The Council does not know of this hole, so it cannot be 
forbidden." 

And they answered: "Since the Council does not know of this hole, there 
can be no law permitting to enter it. And everything which is not permitted by 
law is forbidden." 

But we said: 'We shall go. none the less." 

They were frightened, but they stood by and watched us go. 

We hung on the iron rings with our hands and our feet. We could see

nothing below us. And above us the hole open upon the sky grew smaller and 
smaller, till it came to be the size of a button. But still we went down. Then our 
foot touched the ground. We rubbed our eyes, for we could not see. Then our 
eyes became used to the darkness, and we could not believe what we saw. 

No man known to us could have built this place, nor the men known to our 
brothers who lived before us, and yet it was built by men. It was a great tunnel 
Its walls were hard and smooth to the touch; it felt like stone, but it was not 
stone. On the ground there were long thin tracks of iron, but it was not iron; it 
felt smooth and cold as glass. We knelt, and we crawled forward, our hand 
groping along the iron line to see where it would lead. But there was an 
unbroken night ahead. Only the iron tracks glowed through it, straight and 
white, calling us to follow. But we could not follow, for we were losing the 
puddle of light behind us. So we turned and we crawled back, our hand on the 
iron line. And our heart beat in our fingertips, without reason. And then we 
knew. 

We knew suddenly that this place was left from the Unmentionable Times. 
So it was true, and those Times had been, and all the wonders of those Times. 
Hundreds upon hundreds of years ago men knew secrets which we have lost. 
And we thought: 'This is a foul place. They are damned who touch the tilings of 
the Unmentionable Times." But our hand which followed the track, as we 
crawled, clung to the iron as if it would not leave it, as if the skin of our hand 
were thirsty and begging of the metal some secret fluid beating in its coldness. 

We returned to the earth. International 4-8818 looked upon us and stepped 
back. 

"Equality 7-2521," they said, "your lace is white." 

But we could not speak and we stood looking upon them 

They backed away, as if they dared not touch us. Then they smiled, but it 
was not a gay smile; it was lost and pleading. But still we could not speak. 
Then they said: 

"We shall report our find to the City Council and both of us will be 
rewarded." 

And then we spoke. Our voice was hard and there was no mercy in our 
voice. We said: 

"We shall not report our find to the City Council We shall not report it to 
any men." 

They raised their hands to their ears, for never had they heard such words as 
these. 

"International 4-88 18," we asked, "will you report us to the Council and see 
us lashed to death before your eyes?"

They stood straight of a sudden and they answered: 

"Rather would we die." 

"Then," we said, "keep silent. This place is ours. This place belongs to us, 
Equality 7-2521, and to no other men on earth. And if ever we surrender it, we 
shall surrender our life with it also." 

Then we saw that the eyes of International 4-8818 were full to the lids with 
tears they dared not drop, they whispered, and their voice trembled, so that 
their words lost all shape: 

"The will of the Council is above all tilings, for it is the will of our brothers, 
which is holy. But if you wish it so, we shall obey you. Rather shall we be evil 
with you than good with all our brothers. May the Council have mercy upon 
both our hearts!" 

Then we walked away together and back to the Home of the Street 
Sweepers. And we walked in silence. 

Thus did it come to pass that each ni gh t, when the stars are hi gh and the 
Street Sweepers sit in the City Theatre, we, Equality 7-2521, steal out and run 
through the darkness to our place. It is easy to leave the Theatre; when the 
candles are blown and the Actors come onto the stage, no eyes can see us as 
we crawl under our seat and under the cloth of the tent. Later it is easy to steal 
through the shadows and fall in line next to International 4-88 1 8, as the column 
leaves the Theatre. It is dark in the streets and there are no men about, for no 
men may walk through the City when they have no mission to walk there. Each 
night, we run to the ravine, and we remove the stones we have piled upon the 
iron grill to hide it from men. Each night, for three hours, we are under the 
earth, alone. 

We have stolen candles from the Home of the Street Sweepers, we have 
stolen flints and knives and paper, and we have brought them to this place. We 
have stolen glass vials and powders and acids from the Home of the Scholars. 
Now we sit in the tunnel for three hours each night and we study. We melt 
strange metals, and we mix acids, and we cut open the bodies of the animals 
which we find in the City Cesspool. We have built an oven of the bricks we 
gathered in the streets. We bum the wood we find in the ravine. The fire 
flickers in the oven and blue shadows dance upon the walls, and there is no 
sound of men to disturb us. 

We have stolen manuscripts. This is a great offense. Manuscripts are 
precious, for our brothers in the Home of the Clerks spend one year to copy 
one single script in their clear handwriting. Manuscripts are rare and they are 
kept in the Home of the Scholars. So we sit under the earth and we read the 
stolen scripts. Two years have passed since we found this place. And in these 
two years we have learned more than we had learned in the ten years of the 
Home of the Students.

Anthem, by Ayn Rand 

We have learned tilings which are not in the scripts. We have solved secrets 
of which the Scholars have no knowledge. We have come to see how great is 
the unexplored, and many lifetimes will not bring us to the end of our quest. We 
wish nothing, save to be alone and to leam, and to feel as if with each day our 
sight were growing sharper than the hawk's and clearer than rock crystal. 

Strange are the ways of evil. We are lake in the faces of our brothers. We 
are defying the will of our Councik. We alone, of the thousands who walk thk 
earth, we alone in thk hour are doing a work which has no purpose save that 
we wkh to do it. The evil of our crime k not for the human mind to probe. The 
nature of our punkhment, if it be dkcovered, k not free for the human heart to 
ponder. Never, not in the memory of the Ancient Ones' Ancients, never have 
men done what we are doing. 

And yet there k no shame in us and no regret. We say to ourselves that we 
are a wretch and a traitor. But we feel no burden upon our spirit and no fear in 
our heart. And it seems to us that our spirit k clear as a lake troubled by no 
eyes save those of the sun. And in our heart — strange are the ways of evil! — in 
our heart there k the first peace we have known in twenty years. 


Chapter Two 

Liberty 5-3000... Liberty five-three thousand... Liberty 5- 

3000.... 


We wkh to write thk name. We wkh to speak it, but we dare not speak it 
above a whkper. For men are forbidden to take notice of women, and women 
are forbidden to take notice of men. But we think of one among women, they 
whose name k Liberty 5-3000, and we think of no others. 

The women who have been assigned to work the soil live in the Homes of 
the Peasants beyond the City. Where the City ends there k a great road 
winding off to the north, and we Street Sweepers must keep thk road clean to 
the first milepost. There k a hedge along the road, and beyond the hedge lie the 
fields. The fields are black and ploughed, and they lie like a great fan before us, 
with their furrows gathered in some hand beyond the sky, spreading forth from 
that hand, opening wide apart as they come toward us, like black pleats that 
sparkle with thin, green spangles. Women work in the fields, and their white 
tunics in the wind are like the wings of sea-gulk beating over the black soil 

And there it was that we saw Liberty 5-3000 walking along the furrows. 
Their body was straight and thin as a blade of iron. Their eyes were dark and 
hard and glowing, with no fear in them, no kindness and no guilt. Their hair was

golden as the sun; their hair flew in the wind, shining and wild, as if it defied 
men to restrain it. They threw seeds from their hand as if they deigned to fling a 
scornful gift, and the earth was a beggar under their feet. 

We stood still; for the first time we knew fear, and then pain. And we stood 
still that we might not spill this pain more precious than pleasure. 

Then we heard a voice from the others call their name: "Liberty 5-3000," 
and they turned and walked back. Thus we learned their name, and we stood 
watching them go, till their white tunic was lost in the blue mist. 

And the following day, as we came to the northern road, we kept our eyes 
upon Liberty 5-3000 in the field. And each day thereafter we knew the illness 
of waiting for our hour on the northern road. And there we looked at Liberty 
5-3000 each day. We know not whether they looked at us also, but we think 
they did. 

Then one day they came close to the hedge, and suddenly they turned to us. 
They turned in a whirl and the movement of their body stopped, as if slashed 
oft as suddenly as it had started. They stood still as a stone, and they looked 
straight upon us, straight in our eyes. There was no smile on their lace, and no 
welcome. But their face was taut, and their eyes were dark. Then they turned 
as swiftly, and they walked away from us. 

But the following day, when we came to the road, they smiled. They smiled 
to us and for us. And we smiled in answer. Their head fell back, and their arms 
fell, as if their arms and their thin white neck were stricken suddenly with a 
great lassitude. They were not looking upon us, but upon the sky. Then they 
glanced at us over their shoulder, and we felt as if a hand had touched our 
body, slipping softly from our lips to our feet. 

Every morning thereafter, we greeted each other with our eyes. We dared 
not speak. It is a transgression to speak to men of other Trades, save in groups 
at the Social Meetings. But once, standing at the hedge, we raised our hand to 
our forehead and then moved it slowly, palm down, toward Liberty 5-3000. 
Had the others seen it, they could have guessed nothing, for it looked only as if 
we were shading our eyes from the sun. But Liberty 5-3000 saw it and 
understood. They raised their hand to their forehead and moved it as we had. 
Thus, each day, we greet Liberty 5-3000, and they answer, and no men can 
suspect. 

We do not wonder at this new sin of ours. It is our second Transgression of 
Preference, for we do not think of all our brothers, as we must, but only of 
one, and their name is Liberty 5-3000. We do not know why we think of 
them We do not know why, when we think of them, we feel of a sudden that 
the earth is good and that it is not a burden to live. 

We do not think of them as Liberty 5-3000 any longer. We have given them 
a name in our thoughts. We call them the Golden One. But it is a sin to give

men other names which distinguish them from other men. Yet we call them the 
Golden One, for they are not like the others. The Golden One are not like the 
others. 

And we take no heed of the law which says that men may not think of 
women, save at the Time of Mating. This is the time each spring when all the 
men older than twenty and all the women older than eighteen are sent for one 
night to the City Palace of Mating. And each of the men have one of the 
women assigned to them by the Council of Eugenics. Children are bom each 
winter, but women never see their children and children never know their 
parents. Twice have we been sent to the Palace of Mating, but it is an ugly and 
shameful matter, of which we do not like to think. 

We had broken so many laws, and today we have broken one more. Today 
we spoke to the Golden One. 

The other women were far off in the field, when we stopped at the hedge by 
the side of the road. The Golden One were kneeling alone at the moat which 
runs through the field. And the drops of water falling from their hands, as they 
raised the water to their lips, were like sparks of fire in the sun. Then the 
Golden One saw us, and they did not move, kneeling there, looking at us, and 
circles of light played upon their white tunic, from the sun on the water of the 
moat, and one sparkling drop fell from a finger of their hand held as frozen in 
the air. 

Then the Golden One rose and walked to the hedge, as if they had heard a 
command in our eyes. The two other Street Sweepers of our brigade were a 
hundred paces away down the road. And we thought that International 4-8818 
would not betray us, and Union 5-3992 would not understand. So we looked 
straight upon the Golden One, and we saw the shadows of their lashes on their 
white cheeks and the sparks of sun on their lips. And we said: 

'You are beautiful, Liberty 5-3000." 

Their lace did not move and they did not avert their eyes. Only their eyes 
grew wider, and there was triumph in their eyes, and it was not triumph over 
us, but over tilings we could not guess. 

Then they asked: 

"What is your name?" 

'Equality 7-2521," we answered. 

'You are not one of our brothers, Equality 7-2521, for we do not wish you 
to be." 

We cannot say what they meant, for there are no words for their meaning, 
but we know it without words and we knew it then.

"No," we answered, "nor are you one of our sisters." 

"If you see us among scores of women, will you look upon us?" 

"We shall look upon you. Liberty 5-3000, if we see you among all the 
women of the earth." 

Then they asked: 

"Are Street Sweepers sent to different parts of the City or do they always 
work in the same places?" 

"They always work in the same places," we answered, "and no one will take 
this road away from us." 

'Your eyes," they said, "are not like the eyes of any among men." 

And suddenly, without cause for the thought which came to us, we felt cold, 
cold to our stomach. 

"How old are you?" we asked. 

They understood our thought, for they lowered their eyes for the first time. 

"Seventeen," they whispered. 

And we sighed, as if a burden had been taken from us, for we had been 
t hin kin g without reason of the Palace of Mating. And we thought that we would 
not let the Golden One be sent to the Palace. How to prevent it, how to bar 
the will of the Councils, we knew not, but we knew suddenly that we would. 
Only we do not know why such thought came to us, for these ugly matters 
bear no relation to us and the Golden One. What relation can they bear? 

Still, without reason, as we stood there by the hedge, we felt our lips drawn 
tight with hatred, a sudden hatred for all our brother men. And the Golden One 
saw it and smiled slowly, and there was in their smile the first sadness we had 
seen in them We think that in the wisdom of women the Golden One had 
understood more than we can understand. 

Then three of the sisters in the field appeared, coming toward the road, so 
the Golden One walked away from us. They took the bag of seeds, and they 
threw the seeds into the furrows of earth as they walked away. But the seeds 
flew wildly, for the hand of the Golden One was trembling. 

Yet as we walked back to the Home of the Street Sweepers, we felt that 
we wanted to sing, without reason. So we were reprimanded tonight, in the 
dining hall, for without knowing it we had begun to sing aloud some time we 
had never heard. But it is not proper to sing without reason, save at the Social 
Meetings. 

"We are singing because we are happy," we answered the one of the Home

Council who reprimanded us. 

"Indeed you are happy," they answered. "How else can men be when they 
live for their brothers?" 

And now, sitting here in our tunnel, we wonder about these words. It is 
forbidden, not to be happy. For, as it lias been explained to us, men are free 
and the earth belongs to them; and all tilings on earth belong to all men; and the 
will of all men together is good for all; and so all men must be happy. 

Yet as we stand at night in the great half removing our gannents for sleep, 
we look upon our brothers and we wonder. The heads of our brothers are 
bowed. The eyes of our brothers are dulf and never do they look one another 
in the eyes. The shoulders of our brothers are hunched, and their muscles are 
drawn, as if their bodies were shrinking and wished to shrink out of sight. And 
a word steals into our mind, as we look upon our brothers, and that word is 
fear. 

There is fear hanging in the air of the sleeping halls, and in the air of the 
streets. Fear walks through the City, fear without name, without shape. All men 
feel it and none dare to speak. 

We feel it also, when we are in the Home of the Street Sweepers. But here, 
in our tunnef we feel it no longer. The air is pure under the ground. There is no 
odor of men. And these three hours give us strength for our hours above the 
ground. 

Our body is betraying us, for the Council of the Home looks with suspicion 
upon us. It is not good to feel too much joy nor to be glad that our body lives. 
For we matter not and it must not matter to us whether we live or die, which is 
to be as our brothers will it. But we, Equality 7-2521, are glad to be living. If 
this is a vice, then we wish no virtue. 

Yet our brothers are not like us. All is not well with our brothers. There are 
Fraternity 2-5503, a quiet boy with wise, kind eyes, who cry suddenly, without 
reason, in the midst of day or night, and their body shakes with sobs so they 
cannot explain. There are Solidarity 9-6347, who are a bright youth, without 
fear in the day; but they scream in their sleep, and they scream: 'Help us! Help 
us! Help us!" into the night, in a voice which chills our bones, but the Doctors 
cannot cure Solidarity 9-6347. 

And as we all undress at night, in the dim li g ht of candles, our brothers are 
silent, for they dare not speak the thoughts of their minds. For all must agree 
with all, and they cannot know if their thoughts are the thoughts of all, and so 
they fear to speak. And they are glad when the candles are blown for the ni gh t. 
But we, Equality 7-2521, look through the window upon the sky, and there is 
peace in the sky, and cleanliness, and dignity. And beyond the City there lies 
the plain, and beyond the plain, black upon the black sky, there lies the 
Uncharted Forest.

Anthem, by Ayn Rand 

We do not wish to look upon the Uncharted Forest. We do not wish to 
think of it. But ever do our eyes return to that black patch upon the sky. Men 
never enter the Uncharted Forest, for there is no power to explore it and no 
path to lead among its ancient trees which stand as guards of fearful secrets. It 
is whispered that once or twice in a hundred years, one among the men of the 
City escape alone and run to the Uncharted Forest, without call or reason. 
These men do not return. They perish from hunger and from the claws of the 
wild beasts which roam the Forest. But our Councils say this is only a legend. 
We have heard that there are many Uncharted Forests over the land, among 
the Cities. And it is whispered that they have grown over the mins of many 
cities of the Unmentionable Times. The trees have swallowed the ruins, and the 
bones under the mins, and all the tilings which perished. 

And as we look upon the Uncharted Forest far in the night, we think of the 
secrets of the Unmentionable Times. And we wonder how it came to pass that 
these secrets were lost to the world. We have heard the legends of the great 
fighting, in which many men fought on one side and only a few on the other. 
These few were the Evil Ones and they were conquered. Then great fires 
raged over the land. And in these fires the Evil Ones were burned. And the fire 
which is called the Dawn of the Great Rebirth, was the Script Fire where all the 
scripts of the Evil Ones were burned, and with them all the words of the Evil 
Ones. Great mountains of flame stood in the squares of the Cities for three 
months. Then came the Great Rebirth. 

The words of the Evil Ones... The words of the Unmentionable Times... 
What are the words which we have lost? 

May the Council have mercy upon us! We had no wish to write such a 
question, and we knew not what we were doing till we had written it. We shall 
not ask this question and we shall not think it. We shall not call death upon our 
head. 

And yet... And yet... 

There is some word, one single word which is not in the language of men, 
but which has been. And this is the Unspeakable Word, which no men may 
speak nor hear. But sometimes, and it is rare, sometimes, somewhere, one 
among men find that word. They find it upon scraps of old manuscripts or cut 
into the fragments of ancient stones. But when they speak it they are put to 
death. There is no crime punished by death in this world, save this one crime of 
speaking the Unspeakable Word. 

We have seen one of such men burned alive in the square of the City. And it 
was a sight which has stayed with us through the years, and it haunts us, and 
follows us, and it gives us no rest. We were a child then, ten years old. And we 
stood in the great square with all the children and all the men of the City, sent 
to behold the burning. They brought the Transgressor out into the square and 
they led him to the pyre. They had tom out the tongue of the Transgressor, so

that they could speak no longer. The Transgressor were yoimg and tall. They 
had hair of gold and eyes blue as morning. They walked to the pyre, and their 
step did not falter. And of all the faces on that square, of all the laces which 
shrieked and screamed and spat curses upon them, theirs was the calmest and 
happiest lace. 

As the chains were wound over their body at the stake, and a flame set to 
the pyre, the Transgressor looked upon the City. There was a thin thread of 
blood running from the comer of their mouth, but their lips were smiling. And a 
monstrous thought came to us then, which has never left us. We had heard of 
Saints. There are the Saints of Labor, and the Saints of the Councils, and the 
Saints of the Great Rebirth. But we had never seen a Saint nor what the 
likeness of a Saint should be. And we thought then, standing in the square, that 
the likeness of a Saint was the lace we saw before us in the flames, the face of 
the Transgressor of the Unspeakable Word. 

As the flames rose, a tiling happened which no eyes saw but ours, else we 
would not be living today. Perhaps it had only seemed to us. But it seemed to 
us that the eyes of the Transgressor had chosen us from the crowd and were 
looking straight upon us. There was no pain in their eyes and no knowledge of 
the agony of their body. There was only joy in them, and pride, a pride holier 
than it is fit for human pride to be. And it seemed as if these eyes were trying to 
tell us something through the flames, to send into our eyes some word without 
sound. And it seemed as if these eyes were begging us to gather that word and 
not to let it go from us and from the earth. But the flames rose and we could 
not guess the word.... 

What — even if we have to bum for it like the Saint of the pyre — what is the 
Unspeakable Word? 


Chapter Three 

We, Equality 7-2521, have discovered a new power of nature. And we 
have discovered it alone, and we are to know it. 

It is said. Now let us be lashed for it, if we must. The Council of Scholars 
lias said that we all know the tilings which exist and therefore all the tilings 
which are not known by all do not exist. But we think that the Council of 
Scholars is blind. The secrets of this earth are not for all men to see, but only 
for those who will seek them. We know, for we have found a secret unknown 
to all our brothers. 

We know not what this power is nor whence it conies. But we know its

nature, we have watched it and worked with it. We saw it first two years ago. 
One night, we were cutting open the body of a dead frog when we saw its leg 
jerking. It was dead, yet it moved. Some power unknown to men was making 
it move. We could not understand it. Then, after many tests, we found the 
answer. The frog had been hanging on a wire of copper; and it had been the 
metal of our knife which had sent a strange power to the copper through the 
brine of the frog's body. We put a piece of copper and a piece of zinc into a 
jar of brine, we touched a wire to them, and there, under our fingers, was a 
miracle which had never occurred before, a new miracle and a new power. 

This discovery haunted us. We followed it in preference to all our studies. 
We worked with it, we tested in more ways than we can describe, and each 
step was another miracle unveiling before us. We came to know that we had 
found the greatest power on earth. For it defies all the laws known to men. It 
makes the needle move and turn on the compass which we stole from the 
Home of the Scholars; but we had been taught, when still a child, that the 
loadstone points to the north and this is a law which nothing can change; yet 
our new power defies all laws. We found that it causes lightning, and never 
have men known what causes li g htning. In thunderstorms, we raised a tall rod 
of iron by the side of our hole, and we watched it from below. We have seen 
the li gh tning strike it again and again. And now we know that metal draws the 
power of the sky, and that metal can be made to give it forth. 

We have built strange tilings with this discovery of ours. We used for it the 
copper wires which we found here under the ground. We have walked the 
length of our tunnel, with a candle lighting the way. We could go no farther than 
half a mile, for earth and rock had fallen at both ends. But we gathered all the 
tilings we found and we brought them to our work place. We found strange 
boxes with bars of metal inside, with many cords and strands and coils of 
metaL We found wires that led to strange little globes of glass on the walls; they 
contained threads of metal t hin ner than a spider's web. 

These tilings help us in our work. We do not understand them, but we think 
that the men of the Unmentionable Times had known our power of the sky, 
and these tilings had some relation to it. We do not know, but we shall leam. 
We cannot stop now, even though it frightens us that we are alone in our 
knowledge. 

No single one can possess greater wisdom than the many Scholars who are 
elected by all men for their wisdom. Yet we can. We do. We have fought 
against saying it, but now it is said. We do not care. We forget all men, all laws 
and all tilings save our metals and our wires. So much is still to be learned! So 
long a road lies before us, and what care we if we must travel it alone!

Chapter Four 

Many days passed before we could speak to the Golden One again. But 
then came the day when the sky turned white, as if the sun had burst and 
spread its flame in the air, and the fields lay still without breath, and the dust of 
the road was white in the glow. So the women of the field were weary, and 
they tarried over their work, and they were far from the road when we came. 
But the Golden One stood alone at the hedge, waiting. We stopped and we 
saw that their eyes, so hard and scornful to the world, were looking at us as if 
they would obey any word we might speak. 

And we said: 

"We have given you a name in our thoughts, Liberty 5-3000." 

"What is our name?" they asked. 

"The Golden One." 

"Nor do we call you Equality 7-252 1 when we think ofyou." 

"What name have you given us?" 

They looked straight into our eyes and they held their head hi gh and they 
answered: 

"The Unconquered." 

For a long time we could not speak. Then we said: 

"Such thoughts are forbidden, Golden One." 

"But you think such thoughts as these and you wish us to think them " 

We looked into their eyes and we could not lie. 

'Yes," we whispered, and they smiled, and then we said: "Our dearest one, 
do not obey us." 

They stepped back, and their eyes were wide and stilL 

"Speak those words again," they whispered. 

"Which words?" we asked. But they did not answer, and we knew it. 

"Our dearest one," we whispered. 

Never have men said this to women. 

The head of the Golden One bowed slowly, and they stood still before us, 
their anus at their sides, the palms of their hands turned to us, as if their body 
were delivered in submission to our eyes. And we could not speak.

Then they raised their head, and they spoke simply and gently, as if they 
wished us to forget some anxiety of their own. 

"The day is hot," they said, "and you have worked for many hours and you 
must be weary." 

"No," we answered. 

"It is cooler in the fields," they said, "and there is water to drink. Are you 
thirsty?" 

'Yes," we answered, "but we cannot cross the hedge." 

"We shall bring the water to you," they said. 

Then they knelt by the moat, they gathered water in their two hands, they 
rose and they held the water out to our lips. 

We do not know if we drank that water. We only knew suddenly that their 
hands were empty, but we were still holding our lips to their hands, and that 
they knew it but did not move. 

We raised our head and stepped back. For we did not understand what had 
made us do this, and we were afraid to understand it. 

And the Golden One stepped back, and stood looking upon their hands in 
wonder. Then the Golden One moved away, even though no others were 
coming, and they moved stepping back, as if they could not turn from us, their 
arms bent before them, as if they could not lower their hands. 


Chapter Five 

We made it. We created it. We brought it forth from the night of the ages. 
We alone. Our hands. Our mind. Ours alone and only. 

We know not what we are saying. Our head is reeling. We look upon the 
light which we had made . W e shall be forgiven for anything we say tonight. . . . 

Toni g ht, after more days and trials than we can count, we finished building a 
strange tiling, from the remains of the Unmentionable Times, a box of glass, 
devised to give forth the power of the sky of greater strength than we had ever 
achieved before. And when we put our wires to this box, when we closed the 
current — the wire glowed! It came to life, it turned red, and a circle of li gh t lay 
on the stone before us. 

We stood, and we held our head in our hands. We could not conceive of

that which we had created. We had touched no flint, made no fire. Yet here 
was light, light that came from nowhere, light from the heart of metaL 

We blew out the candle. Darkness swallowed us. There was nothing left 
around us, nothing save night and a thin thread of flame in it, as a crack in the 
wall of a prison. We stretched our hands to the wire, and we saw our fingers in 
the red glow. We could not see our body nor feel it, and in that moment 
no tiling existed save our two hands over a wire glowing in a black abyss. 

Then we thought of the meaning of that which lay before us. We can light 
our tunnel, and the City, and all the Cities of the world with no tiling save metal 
and wires. We can give our brothers a new light, cleaner and brighter than any 
they have ever known. The power of the sky can be made to do men's 
bidding. There are no limits to its secrets and its mi gh t, and it can be made to 
grant us anything if we but choose to ask. 

Then we knew what we must do. Our discovery is too great for us to waste 
our time in sweeping streets. We must not keep our secret to ourselves, nor 
buried under the ground. We must bring it into the sight of all men. We need all 
our time, we need the work rooms of the Home of the Scholars, we want the 
help of our brother Scholars and their wisdom joined to ours. There is so much 
work ahead for all of us, for all the Scholars of the world. 

In a month, the World Council of Scholars is to meet in our City. It is a great 
Council, to which the wisest of all lands are elected, and it meets once a year in 
the different Cities of the earth. We shall go to this Council and we shall lay 
before them, as our gift, the glass box with the power of the sky. We shall 
confess everything to them They will see, understand and forgive. For our gift 
is greater than our transgression. They will explain it to the Council of 
Vocations, and we shall be assigned to the Home of the Scholars. This has 
never been done before, but neither has a gift such as ours ever been offered to 
men. 

We must wait. We must guard our tunnel as we had never guarded it before. 
For should any men save the Scholars leam of our secret, they would not 
understand it, nor would they believe us. They would see nothing, save our 
crime of working alone, and they would destroy us and our light. We care not 
about our body, but our light is... 

Yes, we do care. For the first time we do care about our body. For this 
wire is a part of our body, as a vein tom from us, glowing with our blood. Are 
we proud of this thread of metal, or of our hands which made it, or is there a 
line to divide these two? 

We stretch out our anus. For the first time do we know how strong our 
anus are. And a strange thought comes to us: we wonder, for the first time in 
our life, what we look like. Men never see their own laces and never ask their 
brothers about it, for it is evil to have concern for their own laces or bodies.

Anthem, by Ayn Rand 

But tonight, for a reason we cannot fathom, we wish it were possible to us to 
know the likeness of our own person. 


Chapter Six 

We have not written for thirty days. For thirty days we have not been here, 
in our tunnel We had been caught. 

It happened on that night when we wrote last. We forgot, that ni gh t, to 
watch the sand in the glass which tells us when three hours have passed and it 
is time to return to the City Theatre. When we remembered, the sand had run 
out. 

We hastened to the Theatre. But the big tent stood grey and silent against 
the sky. The streets of the City lay before us, dark and empty. If we went back 
to hide in our tunnel, we would be found and our light with us. So we walked 
to the Home of the Street Sweepers. 

When the Council of the Home questioned us, we looked upon the laces of 
the Council, but there was no curiosity in those laces, and no anger, and no 
mercy. So when the oldest of them asked us: 'Where have you been?" we 
thought of our glass box and of our light, and we forgot all else. And we 
answered: 

'We will not tell you." 

The oldest did not question us further. They turned to the two yoimgest, and 
said, and their voice was bored: 

"Take our brother Equality 7-2521 to the Palace of Corrective Detention. 
Lash them until they tell." 

So we were taken to the Stone Room under the Palace of Corrective 
Detention. This room lias no windows and it is empty save for an iron post. 
Two men stood by the post, naked but for leather aprons and leather hoods 
over their laces. Those who had brought us departed, leaving us to the two 
Judges who stood in a comer of the room The Judges were small thin men, 
grey and bent. They gave the signal to the two strong hooded ones. 

They tore our clothes from our body, they threw us down upon our knees 
and they tied our hands to the iron post. 

The first blow of the lash felt as if our spine had been cut in two. The second 
blow stopped the first, and for a second we felt nothing, then pain struck us in 
our throat and fire ran in our lungs without air. But we did not cry out.

Anthem, by Ayn Rand 

The lash whistled like a singing wind. We tried to count the blows, but we 
lost count. We knew that the blows were falling upon our back. Only we felt 
nothing upon our back any longer. A flaming grill kept dancing before our eyes, 
and we thought of nothing save that grill, a grill, a grill of red squares, and then 
we knew that we were looking at the squares of the iron grill in the door, and 
there were also the squares of stone on the walls, and the squares which the 
lash was cutting upon our back, crossing and re-crossing itself in our flesh. 

Then we saw a fist before us. It knocked our chin up, and we saw the red 
froth of our mouth on the withered fingers, and the Judge asked: 

"Where have you been?" 

But we jerked our head away, laid our face upon our tied hands, and bit our 
lips. 

The lash whistled again. We wondered who was sprinkling burning coal dust 
upon the floor, for we saw drops of red twinkling on the stones around us. 

Then we knew nothing, save two voices snarling steadily, one after the 
other, even though we knew they were speaking many minutes apart: 

"Where have you been where have you been where have you been where 
have you been?..." 

And our lips moved, but the sound trickled back into our throat, and the 
sound was only: 

"The light. . . The light... The light...." 

Then we knew nothing. 

We opened our eyes, lying on our stomach on the brick floor of a cell We 
looked upon two hands lying far before us on the bricks, and we moved them, 
and we knew that they were our hands. But we could not move our body. 
Then we smiled, for we thought of the light and that we had not betrayed it. 

We lay in our cell for many days. The door opened twice each day, once for 
the men who brought us bread and water, and once for the Judges. Many 
Judges came to our cell, first the humblest and then the most honored Judges of 
the City. They stood before us in their white togas, and they asked: 

"Are you ready to speak?" 

But we shook our head, lying before them on the floor. And they departed. 

We counted each day and each night as it passed. Then, tonight, we knew 
that we must escape. For tomorrow the World Council of Scholars is to meet 
in our City. 

It was easy to escape from the Palace of Corrective Detention. The locks

are old on the doors and there are no guards about. There is no reason to have 
guards, for men have never defied the Councils so far as to escape from 
whatever place they were ordered to be. Our body is healthy and strength 
returns to it speedily. We lunged against the door and it gave way. We stole 
through the dark passages, and through the dark streets, and down into our 
tunnel. 

We lit the candle and we saw that our place had not been found and no tiling 
had been touched. And our glass box stood before us on the cold oven, as we 
had left it. What matter they now, the scars upon our back! 

Tomorrow, in the full light of day, we shall take our box, and leave our 
tunnel open, and walk through the streets to the Home of the Scholars. We 
shall put before them the greatest gift ever offered to men. We shall tell them 
the truth. We shall hand to them, as our confession, these pages we have 
written. We shall join our hands to theirs, and we shall work together, with the 
power of the sky, for the glory of mankind. Our blessing upon you, our 
brothers! Tomorrow, you will take us back into your fold and we shall be an 
outcast no longer. Tomorrow we shall be one of you again. Tomorrow... 


Chapter Seven 

It is dark here in the forest. The leaves rustle over our head, black against 
the last gold of the sky. The moss is soft and warm. We shall sleep on this 
moss for many nights, till the beasts of the forest come to tear our body. We 
have no bed now, save the moss, and no future, save the beasts. 

We are old now, yet we were yoimg this morning, when we carried our 
glass box through the streets of the City to the Home of the Scholars. No men 
stopped us, for there were none about the Palace of Corrective Detention, and 
the others knew nothing. No men stopped us at the gate. We walked through 
the empty passages and into the great hall where the World Council of 
Scholars sat in solemn meeting. 

We saw no tiling as we entered, save the sky in the great windows, blue and 
glowing. Then we saw the Scholars who sat around a long table; they were as 
shapeless clouds huddled at the rise of a great sky. There were the men whose 
famous names we knew, and others from distant lands whose names we had 
not heard. We saw a great painting on the wall over their heads, of the twenty 
illustrious men who had invented the candle. 

All the heads of the Council turned to us as we entered. These great and 
wise of the earth did not know what to think of us, and they looked upon us

with wonder and curiosity, as if we were a miracle. It is true that our tunic was 
tom and stained with brown stains which had been blood. We raised our right 
ann and we said: 

"Our greeting to you, our honored brothers of the World Council of 
Scholars!" 

Then Collective 0-0009, the oldest and wisest of the Council, spoke and 
asked: 

'Who are you, our brother? For you do not look like a Scholar." 

"Our name is Equality 7-2521," we answered, "and we are a Street 
Sweeper of this City." 

Then it was as if a great wind had stricken the hall, for all the Scholars spoke 
at once, and they were angry and frightened. 

"A Street Sweeper! A Street Sweeper walking in upon the World Council 
of Scholars! It is not to be believed! It is against all the rules and all the laws!" 

But we knew how to stop them. 

"Our brothers!" we said. 'We matter not, nor our transgression. It is only 
our brother men who matter. Give no thought to us, for we are nothing, but 
listen to our words, for we bring you a gift such as lias never been brought to 
men. Listen to us, for we hold the future of mankind in our hands." 

Then they listened. 

We placed our glass box on the table before them We spoke of it, and of 
our long quest, and of our tunnel, and of our escape from the Palace of 
Corrective Detention. Not a hand moved in that hall, as we spoke, nor an eye. 
Then we put the wires to the box, and they all bent forward and sat still, 
watching. And we stood still, our eyes upon the wire. And slowly, slowly as a 
flush of blood, a red flame trembled in the wire. Then the wire glowed. 

But terror struck the men of the Council. They leapt to their feet, they ran 
from the table, and they stood pressed against the wall, huddled together, 
seeking the warmth of one another's bodies to give them courage. 

We looked upon them and we laughed and said: 

'Fear nothing, our brothers. There is a great power in these wires, but this 
power is tamed. It is yours. We give it to you." 

Still they would not move. 

"We give you the power of the sky!" we cried. 'We give you the key to the 
earth! Take it, and let us be one of you, the humblest among you. Let us work 
together, and harness this power, and make it ease the toil of men. Let us

throw away our candles and our torches. Let us flood our cities with light. Let 
us bring a new light to men! " 

But they looked upon us, and suddenly we were afraid. For their eyes were 
still, and small, and evil 

"Our brothers!" we cried. "Have you nothing to say to us?" 

Then Collective 0-0009 moved forward. They moved to the table and the 
others followed. 

'Yes," spoke Collective 0-0009, "we have much to say to you." 

The sound of their voice brought silence to the hall and to the beat of our 
heart. 

'Yes," said Collective 0-0009, "we have much to say to a wretch who have 
broken all the laws and who boast of their infamy! How dared you think that 
your mind held greater wisdom than the minds of your brothers? And if the 
Council had decreed that you be a Street Sweeper, how dared you think that 
you could be of greater use to men than in sweeping the streets?" 

"How dared you, gutter cleaner," spoke Fraternity 9-3452, "to hold yourself 
as one alone and with the thoughts of one and not of many?" 

'You shall be burned at the stake," said Democracy 4-6998. 

"No, they shall be lashed," said Unanimity 7-3304, "till there is nothing left 
under the lashes." 

"No," said Collective 0-0009, "we cannot decide upon this, our brothers. 
No such crime lias ever been committed, and it is not for us to judge. Nor for 
any small Council. We shall deliver this creature to the World Council itself and 
let their will be done." 

We looked upon them and we pleaded: 

"Our brothers! You are right. Let the will of the Council be done upon our 
body. We do not care. But the light? What will you do with the light?" 

Collective 0-0009 looked upon us, and they smiled. 

"So you think you have found a new power," said Collective 0-0009. "Do 
you think all your brothers think that?" 

"No," we answered. 

"What is not thought by all men cannot be true," said Collective 0-0009. 

'You have worked on this alone?" asked International 1-5537. 

'Yes," we answered.

"What is not done collectively cannot be good," said International 1-5537. 

'Many men in the Homes of the Scholars have had strange new ideas in the 
past," said Solidarity 8-1164, "but when the majority of their brother Scholars 
voted against them, they abandoned their ideas, as all men must." 

"This box is useless," said A llia nce 6-7349. 

"Should it be what they claim of it," said Harmony 9-2642, "then it would 
bring min to the Department of Candles. The Candle is a great boon to 
mankind, as approved by all men. Therefore it cannot be destroyed by the 
whim of one." 

"This would wreck the Plans of the World Council," said Unanimity 2-9913, 
"and without the Plans of the World Council the sun cannot rise. It took fifty 
years to secure the approval of all the Councils for the Candle, and to decide 
upon the number needed, and to re- fit the Plans so as to make candles instead 
of torches. This touched upon thousands and thousands of men working in 
scores of States. We cannot alter the Plans again so soon." 

"And if this should lighten the toil of men," said Similarity 5-0306, "then it is a 
great evil, for men have no cause to exist save in toiling for other men." 

Then Collective 0-0009 rose and pointed at our box. 

"This tiling," they said, "must be destroyed." 

And all the others cried as one: 

"It must be destroyed!" 

Then we leapt to the table. 

We seized our box, we shoved them aside, and we ran to the window. We 
turned and we looked at them for the last time, and a rage, such as is not fit for 
humans to know, choked our voice in our throat. 

'You fools!" we cried. 'You fools! You thrice- damned fools!" 

We swung our fist through the windowpane, and we leapt out in a ringing 
rain of glass. 

We fell, but we never let the box fall from our hands. Then we ran. We ran 
blindly, and men and houses streaked past us in a torrent without shape. And 
the road seemed not to be flat before us, but as if it were leaping up to meet us, 
and we waited for the earth to rise and strike us in the lace. But we ran. We 
knew not where we were going. We knew only that we must run, run to the 
end of the world, to the end of our days. 

Then we knew suddenly that we were lying on a soft earth and that we had 
stopped. Trees taller than we had ever seen before stood over us in a great

silence. Then we knew. We were in the Uncharted Forest. We had not thought 
of coming here, but our legs had carried our wisdom, and our legs had brought 
us to the Uncharted Forest against our will. 

Our glass box lay beside us. We crawled to it, we fell upon it, our lace in 
our anus, and we lay stilL 

We lay thus for a long time. Then we rose, we took our box, and walked on 
into the forest. 

It mattered not where we went. We knew that men would not follow us, for 
they never entered the Uncharted Forest. We had nothing to fear from them 
The forest disposes of its own victims. This gave us no fear either. Only we 
wished to be away from the City and the air that touches upon the air of the 
City. So we walked on, our box in our anus, our heart empty. 

We are doomed. Whatever days are left to us, we shall spend them alone. 
And we have heard of the corraption to be found in solitude. We have tom 
ourselves from the truth which is our brother men, and there is no road back 
for us, and no redemption. 

We know these tilings, but we do not care. We care for nothing on earth. 
We are tired. 

Only the glass box in our anus is like a living heart that gives us strength. We 
have lied to ourselves. We have not built this box for the good of our brothers. 
We built it for its own sake. It is above all our brothers to us, and its truth 
above their truth. Why wonder about this? We have not many days to live. We 
are walking to the fangs awaiting us somewhere among the great, silent trees. 
There is not a tiling behind us to regret. 

Then a blow of pain strack us, our first and our only. We thought of the 
Golden One. We thought of the Golden One whom we shall never see again. 
Then the pain passed. It is best. We are one of the Damned. It is best if the 
Golden One forget our name and the body which bore that name. 


Chapter Eight 

It has been a day of wonder, this, our first day in the 

forest. 

We awoke when a ray of su nlig ht fell across our face. We wanted to leap to 
our feet, as we have had to leap to our feet every morning of our life, but we 
remembered suddenly that no bell had rung and that there was no bell to ring

anywhere. We lay on our back, we threw our amis out, and we looked up at 
the sky. The leaves had edges of silver that trembled and rippled like a river of 
green and fire flowing high above us. 

We did not wish to move. We thought suddenly that we could lie thus as 
long as we wished, and we laughed aloud at the thought. We could also rise, or 
run, or leap, or fall down again. We were t hin kin g that these were tilings 
without sense, but before we knew it, our body had risen in one leap. Our 
arms stretched out of their own will, and our body whirled and whirled, till it 
raised a wind to rustle through the leaves of the bushes. Then our hands seized 
a branch and swung us hi gh into a tree, with no aim save the wonder of learning 
the strength of our body. The branch snapped under us and we fell upon the 
moss that was soft as a cushion. Then our body, losing all sense, rolled over 
and over on the moss, dry leaves in our tunic, in our hair, in our face. And we 
heard suddenly that we were laughing, laughing aloud, laughing as if there were 
no power left in us save laughter. 

Then we took our glass box, and we went into the forest. We went on, 
cutting through the branches, and it was as if we were swimming through a sea 
of leaves, with the bushes as waves rising and falling and rising around us, and 
flinging their green sprays hi gh to the treetops. The trees parted before us, 
calling us forward. The forest seemed to welcome us. We went on, without 
thought, without care, with nothing to feel save the song of our body. 

We stopped when we felt hunger. We saw birds in the tree branches, and 
flying from under our footsteps. We picked a stone and we sent it as an arrow 
at a bird. It fell before us. We made a fire, we cooked the bird, and we ate it, 
and no meal had ever tasted better to us. And we thought suddenly that there 
was a great satisfaction to be found in the food which we need and obtain by 
our own hand. And we wished to be hungry again and soon, that we might 
know again this strange new pride in eating. 

Then we walked on. And we came to a stream which lay as a streak of 
glass among the trees. It lay so still that we saw no water but only a cut in the 
earth, in which the trees grew down, upturned, and the sky at the bottom We 
knelt by the stream and we bent down to drink. And then we stopped. For, 
upon the blue of the sky below us, we saw our own lace for the first time. 

We sat still and we held our breath. For our lace and our body were 
beautifiiL Our lace was not like the faces of our brothers, for we felt no pity 
when we looked upon it. Our body was not like the bodies of our brothers, for 
our limbs were straight and thin and hard and strong. And we thought that we 
could trust this being who looked upon us from the stream, and that we had 
nothing to fear from this being. 

We walked on till the sun had set. When the shadows gathered among the 
trees, we stopped in a hollow between the roots, where we shall sleep tonight. 
And suddenly, for the first time this day, we remembered that we are the

Damned. We remembered it, and we laughed. 

We are writing this on the paper we had hidden in our tunic together with the 
written pages we had brought for the World Council of Scholars, but never 
given to them We have much to speak of to ourselves, and we hope we shall 
find the words for it in the days to come. Now, we cannot speak, for we 
cannot understand. 


Chapter Nine 

We have not written for many days. We did not wish to speak. For we 
needed no words to remember that which lias happened to us. 

It was on our second day in the forest that we heard steps behind us. We 
laid in the bushes, and we waited. The steps came closer. And then we saw the 
fold of a white tunic among the trees, and a gleam of gold. 

We leapt forward, we ran to them, and we stood looking upon the Golden 
One. 

They saw us, and their hands closed into fists, and the fists pulled their anus 
down, as if they wished their anus to hold them, while their body swayed. And 
they could not speak. 

We dared not come too close to them We asked, and our voice trembled: 

"How come you to be here, Golden One?" 

But they whispered only: 

"We have found you...." 

"How came you to be in the forest?" we asked. 

They raised their head, and there was a great pride in their voice; they 
answered: 

"We have followed you." 

Then we could not speak, and they said: 

"We heard that you had gone to the Uncharted Forest, for the whole City is 
speaking of it. So on the night of the day when we heard it, we ran away from 
the Home of the Peasants. We found the marks of your feet across the plain 
where no men walk. So we followed them, and we went into the forest, and 
we followed the path where the branches were broken by your body."

Their white tunic was tom, and the branches had cut the skin of their anns, 
but they spoke as if they had never taken notice of it, nor of weariness, nor of 
fear. 

"We have followed you," they said, "and we shall follow you wherever you 
go. If danger threatens you, we shall face it also. If it be death, we shall die 
with you. You are damned, and we wish to share your damnation." 

They looked upon us, and their voice was low, but there was bitterness and 
triumph in their voice: 

'Your eyes are as a flame, but our brothers have neither hope nor fire. Your 
mouth is cut of granite, but our brothers are soft and humble. Your head is 
high, but our brothers cringe. You walk, but our brothers crawL We wish to be 
damned with you, rather than be blessed with all our brothers. Do as you 
please with us, but do not send us away from you." 

Then they knelt, and bowed their golden head before us. 

We had never thought of that which we did. We bent to raise the Golden 
One to their feet, but when we touched them, it was as if madness had stricken 
us. We seized their body and we pressed our lips to theirs. The Golden One 
breathed once, and their breath was a moan, and then their amis closed around 
us. 


We stood together for a long time. And we were frightened that we had 
lived for twenty-one years and had never known what joy is possible to men. 

Then we said: 

"Our dearest one. Fear nothing of the forest. There is no danger in solitude. 
We have no need of our brothers. Let us forget their good and our evil, let us 
forget all tilings save that we are together and that there is joy between us. Give 
us your hand. Look ahead. It is our own world, Golden One, a strange, 
unknown world, but our own." 

Then we walked on into the forest, their hand in ours. 

And that night we knew that to hold the body of a woman in our amis is 
neither ugly nor shameful, but the one ecstasy granted to the race of men. 

We have walked for many days. The forest has no end, and we seek no 
end. But each day added to the chain of days between us and the City is like 
an added blessing. 

We have made a bow and many arrows. We can kill more birds than we 
need for our food; we find water and fruit in the forest. At ni gh t, we choose a 
clearing, and we build a ring of fires around it. We sleep in the midst of that 
ring, and the beasts dare not attack us. We can see their eyes, green and 
yellow as coals, watching us from the tree branches beyond. The fires smolder

as a crown of jewels around us, and smoke stands still in the air, in columns 
made blue by the moo nligh t. We sleep together in the midst of the ring, the 
anus of the Golden One around us, their head upon our breast. 

Some day, we shall stop and build a house, when we shall have gone far 
enough. But we do not have to hasten. The days before us are without end, 
like the forest. 

We cannot understand this new life which we have found, yet it seems so 
clear and so simple. When questions come to puzzle us, we walk faster, then 
turn and forget all tilings as we watch the Golden One following. The shadows 
of leaves fall upon their anus, as they spread the branches apart, but their 
shoulders are in the sun. The skin of their anus is like a blue mist, but their 
shoulders are white and glowing, as if the li g ht fell not from above, but rose 
from under their skin. We watch the leaf which lias fallen upon their shoulder, 
and it lies at the curve of their neck, and a drop of dew glistens upon it like a 
jewel. They approach us, and they stop, laughing, knowing what we think, and 
they wait obediently, without questions, till it pleases us to turn and go on. 

We go on and we bless the earth under our feet. But questions come to us 
again, as we walk in silence. If that which we have found is the corruption of 
solitude, then what can men wish for save corruption? If this is the great evil of 
being alone, then what is good and what is evil? 

Everything which comes from the many is good. Everything which comes 
from one is evil. Thus we have been taught with our first breath. We have 
broken the law, but we have never doubted it. Yet now, as we walk the forest, 
we are learning to doubt. 

There is no life for men, save in useful toil for the good of their brothers. But 
we lived not, when we toiled for our brothers, we were only weary. There is 
no joy for men, save the joy shared with all their brothers. But the only tilings 
which taught us joy were the power created in our wires, and the Golden One. 
And both these joys belong to us alone, they come from us alone, they bear no 
relation to our brothers, and they do not concern our brothers in any way. Thus 
do we wonder. 

There is some error, one frightful error, in the thinking of men. What is that 
error? We do not know, but the knowledge struggles within us, struggles to be 
bom. 

Today, the Golden One stopped suddenly and said: 

"We love you." 

But then they frowned and shook their head and looked at us helplessly. 

"No," they whispered, "that is not what we wished to say." 

They were silent, then they spoke slowly, and their words were halting, like

the words of a child learning to speak for the first time: 

"We are one... alone... and only... and we love you who are one... alone... 
and only." 

We looked into each other's eyes and we knew that the breath of a miracle 
had touched us, and fled, and left us groping vainly. 

And we felt tom, tom for some word we could not find. 


Chapter Ten 

We are sitting at a table and we are writing this upon paper made thousands 
of years ago. The light is dim, and we cannot see the Golden One, only one 
lock of gold on the pillow of an ancient bed. This is our home. 

We came upon it today, at sunrise. For many days we have been crossing a 
chain of mountains. The forest rose among cliffs, and whenever we walked out 
upon a barren stretch of rock we saw great peaks before us in the west, and to 
the north of us, and to the south, as far as our eyes could see. The peaks were 
red and brown, with the green streaks of forests as veins upon them, with blue 
mists as veils over their heads. We had never heard of these mountains, nor 
seen them marked on any map. The Uncharted Forest has protected them 
from the Cities and from the men of the Cities. 

We climbed paths where the wild goat dared not follow. Stones rolled from 
under our feet, and we heard them striking the rocks below, farther and farther 
down, and the mountains rang with each stroke, and long after the strokes had 
died. But we went on, for we knew that no men would ever follow our track 
nor reach us here. 

Then today, at sunrise, we saw a white flame among the trees, hi gh on a 
sheer peak before us. We thought that it was a fire and we stopped. But the 
flame was unmoving, yet blinding as liquid metaL So we climbed toward it 
through the rocks. And there, before us, on a broad summit, with the 
mountains rising behind it, stood a house such as we had never seen, and the 
white fire came from the sun on the glass of its windows. 

The house had two stories and a strange roof flat as a floor. There was more 
window than wall upon its walls, and the windows went on straight around 
comers, though how this house kept standing we could not guess. The walls 
were hard and smooth, of that stone unlike stone which we had seen in our 
tunnel. 

We both knew it without words: this house was left from the Unmentionable

Times. The trees had protected it from time and weather, and from men who 
have less pity than time and weather. We turned to the Golden One and we 
asked: 

"Are you afraid?" 

But they shook their head. So we walked to the door, and we threw it open, 
and we stepped together into the house of the Unmentionable Times. 

We shall need the days and the years ahead, to look, to learn and to 
understand the tilings of this house. Today, we could only look and try to 
believe the sight of our eyes. We pulled the heavy curtains from the windows 
and we saw that the rooms were small, and we thought that not more than 
twelve men could have lived here. We thought it strange that man had been 
permitted to build a house for only twelve. 

Never had we seen rooms so frill of light. The sunrays danced upon colors, 
colors, and more colors than we thought possible, we who had seen no houses 
save the white ones, the brown ones and the grey. There were great pieces of 
glass on the walls, but it was not glass, for when we looked upon it we saw our 
own bodies and all the tilings behind us, as on the lace of a lake. There were 
strange tilings which we had never seen and the use of which we do not know. 
And there were globes of glass everywhere, in each room, the globes with the 
metal cobwebs inside, such as we had seen in our tunnel. 

We found the sleeping hall and we stood in awe upon its threshold. For it 
was a small room and there were only two beds in it. We found no other beds 
in the house, and then we knew that only two had lived here, and this passes 
understanding. What kind of world did they have, the men of the 
Unmentionable Times? 

We found gannents, and the Golden One gasped at the sight of them For 
they were not white tunics, nor white togas; they were of all colors, no two of 
them alike. Some crumbled to dust as we touched them, but others were of 
heavier cloth, and they felt soft and new in our fingers. 

We found a room with walls made of shelves, which held rows of 
manuscripts, from the floor to the ceiling. Never had we seen such a number of 
them, nor of such strange shape. They were not soft and rolled, they had hard 
shells of cloth and leather; and the letters on their pages were small and so even 
that we wondered at the men who had such handwriting. We glanced through 
the pages, and we saw that they were written in our language, but we found 
many words which we could not understand. Tomorrow, we shall begin to 
read these scripts. 

When we had seen all the rooms of the house, we looked at the Golden 
One and we both knew the thought in our minds. 

"We shall never leave this house," we said, "nor let it be taken from us. This

is our home and the end of our journey. This is your house, Golden One, and 
ours, and it belongs to no other men whatever as far as the earth may stretch. 
We shall not share it with others, as we share not our joy with them, nor our 
love, nor our hunger. So be it to the end of our days." 

'Your will be done," they said. 

Then we went out to gather wood for the great hearth of our home. We 
brought water from the stream which runs among the trees under our windows. 
We killed a mountain goat, and we brought its flesh to be cooked in a strange 
copper pot we found in a place of wonders, which must have been the cooking 
room of the house. 

We did this work alone, for no words of ours could take the Golden One 
away from the big glass which is not glass. They stood before it and they 
looked and looked upon their own body. 

When the sun sank beyond the mountains, the Golden One fell asleep on the 
floor, amidst jewels, and bottles of crystal, and flowers of silk. We lifted the 
Golden One in our anus and we carried them to a bed, their head falling softly 
upon our shoulder. Then we lit a candle, and we brought paper from the room 
of the manuscripts, and we sat by the window, for we knew that we could not 
sleep tonight. 

And now we look upon the earth and sky. This spread of naked rock and 
peaks and moo nlig ht is like a world ready to be bom, a world that waits. It 
seems to us it asks a sign from us, a spark, a first commandment. We cannot 
know what word we are to give, nor what great deed this earth expects to 
witness. We know it waits. It seems to say it lias great gifts to lay before us. 
We are to speak. We are to give its goal, its hi gh est meaning to all this glowing 
space of rock and sky. 

We look ahead, we beg our heart for guidance in answering this call no 
voice has spoken, yet we have heard. We look upon our hands. We see the 
dust of centuries, the dust which laid great secrets and perhaps great evils. And 
yet it stirs no fear within our heart, but only silent reverence and pity. 

May knowledge come to us! What is this secret our heart lias understood 
and yet will not reveal to us, although it seems to beat as if it were endeavoring 
to tell it?

I am. I think. I will.

Anthem, by Ayn Rand 

My hands. . . My spirit. . . My sky. . . My forest. . . This earth of mine. . . . 

What must I say besides? These are the words. This is the answer. 

I stand here on the summit of the mountain. I lift my head and I spread my 
arms. This, my body and spirit, this is the end of the quest. I wished to know 
the meaning of tilings. I am the meaning. I wished to find a warrant for being. I 
need no warrant for being, and no word of sanction upon my being. I am the 
warrant and the sanction. 

It is my eyes which see, and the sight of my eyes grants beauty to the earth. 
It is my ears which hear, and the hearing of my ears gives its song to the world. 
It is my mind which thinks, and the judgment of my mind is the only searchlight 
that can find the truth. It is my will which chooses, and the choice of my will is 
the only edict I must respect. 

Many words have been granted me, and some are wise, and some are lake, 
but only three are holy: "I will it!" 

Whatever road I take, the guiding star k within me; the guiding star and the 
loadstone which point the way. They point in but one direction. They point to 
me. 

I know not if thk earth on which I stand k the core of the universe or if it k 
but a speck of dust lost in eternity. I know not and I care not. For I know what 
happiness k possible to me on earth. And my happiness needs no higher aim to 
vindicate it. My happiness k not the means to any end. It k the end. It k its 
own goaL It k its own purpose. 

Neither am I the means to any end others may wkh to accompfish. I am not 
a tool for their use. I am not a servant of their needs. I am not a bandage for 
their woimds. I am not a sacrifice on their altars. 

I am a man. Thk miracle of me k mine to own and keep, and mine to guard, 
and mine to use, and mine to kneel before! 

I do not surrender my treasures, nor do I share them. The fortune of my 
spirit k not to be blown into coins of brass and flung to the winds as alms for 
the poor of the spirit. I guard my treasures: my thought, my will, my freedom. 
And the greatest of these k freedom. 

I owe nothing to my brothers, nor do I gather debts from them. I ask none 
to live for me, nor do I live for any others. I covet no man's soul, nor k my soul 
theirs to covet. 

I am neither foe nor friend to my brothers, but such as each of them shall 
deserve of me. And to earn my love, my brothers must do more than to have 
been bom. I do not grant my love without reason, nor to any chance passer-by 
who may wkh to claim it. I honor men with my love. But honor k a tiling to be 
earned.

Anthem, by Ayn Rand 

I shall choose friends among men, but neither slaves nor masters. And I shall 
choose only such as please me, and them I shall love and respect, but neither 
command nor obey. And we shall join our hands when we wish, or walk alone 
when we so desire. For in the temple of his spirit, each man is alone. Let each 
man keep his temple untouched and undefiled. Then let him join hands with 
others if he wishes, but only beyond his holy threshold. 

For the word "We" must never be spoken, save by one's choice and as a 
second thought. This word must never be placed first within man's soul, else it 
becomes a monster, the root of all the evils on earth, the root of man's torture 
by men, and an unspeakable lie. 

The word "We" is as lime poured over men, which sets and hardens to 
stone, and crushes all beneath it, and that which is white and that which is black 
are lost equally in the grey of it. It is the word by which the depraved steal the 
virtue of the good, by which the weak steal the might of the strong, by which 
the fools steal the wisdom of the sages. 

What is my joy if all hands, even the unclean, can reach into it? What is my 
wisdom, if even the fools can dictate to me? What is my freedom, if all 
creatures, even the botched and impotent, are my masters? What is my life, if I 
am but to bow, to agree, and to obey? 

But I am done with this creed of corruption. 

I am done with the monster of "We," the word of serfdom, of plunder, of 
misery, falsehood and shame. 

And now I see the face of god, and I raise this god over the earth, this god 
whom men have sought since men came into being, this god who will grant 
them joy and peace and pride. 

This god, this one word: 


' 1 .

Chapter Twelve 

It was when I read the first of the books I found in my house that I saw the 
word "I." And when I understood this word, the book fell from my hands, and 
I wept, I who had never known tears. I wept in deliverance and in pity for all 
mankind. 

I understood the blessed tiling which I had called my curse. I understood 
why the best in me had been my sins and my transgressions; and why I had

never felt guilt in my sins. I understood that centuries of chains and lashes will 
not kill the spirit of man nor the sense of truth within him. 

I read many books for many days. Then I called the Golden One, and I told 
her what I had read and what I had learned. She looked at me and the first 
words she spoke were: 

"I love you." 

Then I said: 

'My dearest one, it is not proper for men to be without names. There was a 
time when each man had a name of his own to distinguish him from all other 
men. So let us choose our names. I have read of a man who lived many 
thousands of years ago, and of all the names in these books, his is the one I 
wish to bear. He took the light of the gods and brought it to men, and he taught 
men to be gods. And he suffered for his deed as all bearers of li gh t must suffer. 
His name was Prometheus." 

"It shall be your name," said the Golden One. 

"And I have read of a goddess," I said, "who was the mother of the earth 
and of all the gods. Her name was Gaea. Let this be your name, my Golden 
One, for you are to be the mother of a new kind of gods." 

"It shall be my name," said the Golden One. 

Now I look ahead. My future is clear before me. The Saint of the pyre had 
seen the future when he chose me as his heir, as the heir of all the saints and all 
the martyrs who came before him and who died for the same cause, for the 
same word, no matter what name they gave to their cause and their truth. 

I shall live here, in my own house. I shall take my food from the earth by the 
toil of my own hands. I shall leam many secrets from my books. Through the 
years ahead, I shall rebuild the achievements of the past, and open the way to 
carry them further, the achievements which are open to me, but closed forever 
to my brothers, for their minds are shackled to the weakest and dullest among 
them 

I have learned that the power of the sky was known to men long ago; they 
called it Electricity. It was the power that moved their greatest inventions. It lit 
tlids house with li gh t that came from those globes of glass on the walls. I have 
found the engine which produced this light. I shall leam how to repair it and 
how to make it work again. I shall leam how to use the wires which carry this 
power. Then I shall build a barrier of wires around my home, and across the 
paths which lead to my home; a barrier light as a cobweb, more impassable 
than a wall of granite; a barrier my brothers will never be able to cross. For 
they have nothing to fi gh t me with, save the brute force of their numbers. I have 
my mind.

Anthem, by Ayn Rand 

Then here, on this mountaintop, with the world below me and nothing above 
me but the sun, I shall live my own tmth. Gaea is pregnant with my child. He 
will be taught to say "I" and to bear the pride of it. He will be taught to walk 
straight on his own feet. He will be taught reverence for his own spirit. 

When I shall have read all the books and learned my new way, when my 
home will be ready and my earth tilled, I shall steal one day, for the last time, 
into the cursed City of my birth. I shall call to me my friend who lias no name 
save International 4-8818, and all those like him. Fraternity 2-5503, who cries 
without reason, and Solidarity 9-6347 who calls for help in the ni gh t, and a few 
others. I shall call to me all the men and the women whose spirit lias not been 
killed within them and who suffer under the yoke of their brothers. They will 
follow me and I shall lead them to my fortress. And here, in this uncharted 
wilderness, I and they, my chosen friends, my fellow-builders, shall write the 
first chapter in the new history of man. 

These are the last tilings before me. And as I stand here at the door of glory, 
I look behind me for the last time. I look upon the history of men, which I have 
learned from the books, and I wonder. It was a long story, and the spirit which 
moved it was the spirit of man's freedom But what is freedom? Freedom from 
what? There is no tiling to take a man's freedom away from him, save other 
men. To be free, a man must be free of his brothers. That is freedom That and 
no tiling else. 

At first, man was enslaved by the gods. But he broke their chains. Then he 
was enslaved by the kings. But he broke their chains. He was enslaved by his 
birth, by his kin, by his race. But he broke their chains. He declared to all his 
brothers that a man lias rights which neither god nor king nor other men can 
take away from him , no matter what their number, for his is the right of man, 
and there is no right on earth above this right. And he stood on the threshold of 
freedom for which the blood of the centuries behind him had been spilled. 

But then he gave up all he had won, and fell lower than his savage beginning. 

What brought it to pass? What disaster took their reason away from men? 
What whip lashed them to their knees in shame and submission? The worship 
of the word "We." 

When men accepted that worship, the structure of centuries collapsed about 
them, the structure whose every beam had come from the thought of some one 
man, each in his day down the ages, from the depth of some one spirit, such as 
spirit existed but for its own sake. Those men who survived — those eager to 
obey, eager to live for one another, since they had nothing else to vindicate 
them — those men could neither carry on, nor preserve what they had received. 
Thus did all thought, all science, all wisdom perish on earth. Thus did men — 
men with nothing to offer save their great numbers — lose the steel towers, the 
flying ships, the power wires, all the tilings they had not created and could 
never keep. Perhaps, later, some men had been bom with the mind and the

courage to recover these tilings which were lost; perhaps these men came 
before the Councils of Scholars. They answered as I have been answered — 
and for the same reasons. 

But I still wonder how it was possible, in those graceless years of transition, 
long ago, that men did not see whither they were going, and went on, in 
blindness and cowardice, to their late. I wonder, for it is hard for me to 
conceive how men who knew the word "I," could give it up and not know what 
they had lost. But such has been the story, for I have lived in the City of the 
damned, and I know what horror men permitted to be brought upon them 

Perhaps, in those days, there were a few among men, a few of clear sight 
and clean soul, who refused to surrender that word. What agony must have 
been theirs before that which they saw coming and could not stop! Perhaps 
they cried out in protest and in warning. But men paid no heed to their warning. 
And they, those few, fought a hopeless battle, and they perished with their 
banners smeared by their own blood. And they chose to perish, for they knew. 
To them, I send my salute across the centuries, and my pity. 

Theirs is the banner in my hand. And I wish 1 had the power to tell them that 
the despair of their hearts was not to be final, and their night was not without 
hope. For the battle they lost can never be lost. For that which they died to 
save can never perish. Through all the darkness, through all the shame of which 
men are capable, the spirit of man will remain alive on this earth. It may sleep, 
but it will awaken. It may wear chains, but it will break through. And man will 
go on. Man, not men. 

Here, on this mountain, I and my sons and my chosen friends shall build our 
new land and our fort. And it will become as the heart of the earth, lost and 
hidden at first, but beating, beating louder each day. And word of it will reach 
every comer of the earth. And the roads of the world will become as veins 
which will carry the best of the world's blood to my threshold. And all my 
brothers, and the Councils of my brothers, will hear of it, but they will be 
impotent against me. And the day will come when I shall break the chains of 
the earth, and raze the cities of the enslaved, and my home will become the 
capital of a world where each man will be free to exist for his own sake. 

For the coming of that day I shall light, I and my sons and my chosen 
friends. For the freedom of Man. For his rights. For his life. For his honor. 

And here, over the portals of my fort, I shall cut in the stone the word which 
is to be my beacon and my banner. The word which will not die, should we all 
perish in battle. The word which can never die on this earth, for it is the heart of 
it and the meaning and the glory. 

The sacred word:

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm 

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of 
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers 
including obsolete , old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists 
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from 
people in all walks of life. 

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the 
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm' s 
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will 
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project 
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure 
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations .

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg 
Literary Archive Foundation 

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide 
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of 
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be 
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest 
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations 
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt 
status with the IRS. 

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating 
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United 
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a 
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up 
with these requirements . We do not solicit donations in locations 
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance . To 
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any 
particular state visit http://pglaf.org 

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we 
have not met the solicitation requirements , we know of no prohibition 
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who 
approach us with offers to donate. 

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make 
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from 
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff. 

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation 
methods and addresses . Donations are accepted in a number of other

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic 
works . 

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm 
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared 
with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project 
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support. 


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed 
editions , all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. 
unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily 
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition. 


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility : 
http : //www . gutenberg. org 

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, 
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation , how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to 
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
