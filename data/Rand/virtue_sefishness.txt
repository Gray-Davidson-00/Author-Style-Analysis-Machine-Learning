THE VIRTUE 
OF SELFISHNESS 


“Ethics is not a mystic fantasy — nor a social 
convention — nor a dispensable, subjective luxury. 
... Ethics is an objective necessity of man’s 
survival — not by the grace of the supernatural nor 
of your neighbors nor of your whims, but by the 
grace of reality and the nature of life.” 

“The Objectivist ethics proudly advocates and 
upholds rational selfishness — which means: the 
values required for man’s survival qua man — 
which means: the values required for human 
survival — not the values produced by the desires, 
the feelings, the whims or the needs of irrational 
brutes, who have never outgrown the primordial 
practice of human sacrifices.” 

Ever since their first publication, Ayn Rand’s 
works have had a major impact on the intellectual 
scene. Her new morality — the ethics of rational 
self-interest — challenges the altruist-collectivist 
fashions of our day. Known as Objectivism, her 
unique philosophy is the underlying theme of her 
famous novels.

Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


Introduction 


The title of this book may evoke the kind of question that I hear once in a 
while: “Why do you use the word ‘selfishness’ to denote virtuous qualities 
of character, when that word antagonizes so many people to whom it does 
not mean the things you mean?” 

To those who ask it, my answer is: “For the reason that makes you afraid 
of it.” 

But there are others, who would not ask that question, sensing the moral 
cowardice it implies, yet who are unable to formulate my actual reason or to 
identify the profound moral issue involved. It is to them that I will give a 
more explicit answer. 

It is not a mere semantic issue nor a matter of arbitrary choice. The 
meaning ascribed in popular usage to the word “selfishness” is not merely 
wrong: it represents a devastating intellectual “package-deal,” which is 
responsible, more than any other single factor, for the arrested moral 
development of mankind. 

In popular usage, the word “selfishness” is a synonym of evil; the image it 
conjures is of a murderous brute who tramples over piles of corpses to 
achieve his own ends, who cares for no living being and pursues nothing but 
the gratification of the mindless whims of any immediate moment. 

Yet the exact meaning and dictionary definition of the word “selfishness” 
is: concern with one’s own interests. 

This concept does not include a moral evaluation; it does not tell us 
whether concern with one’s own interests is good or evil; nor does it tell us 
what constitutes man’s actual interests. It is the task of ethics to answer such 
questions. 

The ethics of altruism has created the image of the brute, as its answer, in 
order to make men accept two inhuman tenets: (a) that any concern with 
one’s own interests is evil, regardless of what these interests might be, and 
(b) that the brute’s activities are in fact to one’s own interest (which altruism 
enjoins man to renounce for the sake of his neighbors). 

For a view of the nature of altruism, its consequences and the enormity of 
the moral corruption it perpetrates, I shall refer you to Atlas Shrugged — or to 
any of today’s newspaper headlines. What concerns us here is altruism’s 
default in the field of ethical theory. 


5 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


There are two moral questions which altruism lumps together into one 
“package-deal”: (1) What are values? (2) Who should be the beneficiary of 
values? Altruism substitutes the second for the first; it evades the task of 
defining a code of moral values, thus leaving man, in fact, without moral 
guidance. 

Altruism declares that any action taken for the benefit of others is good, 
and any action taken for one’s own benefit is evil. Thus the beneficiary of an 
action is the only criterion of moral value — and so long as that beneficiary is 
anybody other than oneself, anything goes. 

Hence the appalling immorality, the chronic injustice, the grotesque 
double standards, the insoluble conflicts and contradictions that have 
characterized human relationships and human societies throughout history, 
under all the variants of the altruist ethics. 

Observe the indecency of what passes for moral judgments today. An 
industrialist who produces a fortune, and a gangster who robs a bank are 
regarded as equally immoral, since they both sought wealth for their own 
“selfish” benefit. A young man who gives up his career in order to support 
his parents and never rises beyond the rank of grocery clerk is regarded as 
morally superior to the young man who endures an excruciating struggle and 
achieves his personal ambition. A dictator is regarded as moral, since the 
unspeakable atrocities he committed were intended to benefit “the people,” 
not himself 

Observe what this beneficiary-criterion of morality does to a man’s life. 
The first thing he leams is that morality is his enemy; he has nothing to gain 
from it, he can only lose; self-inflicted loss, self-inflicted pain and the gray, 
debilitating pall of an incomprehensible duty is all that he can expect. He 
may hope that others might occasionally sacrifice themselves for his benefit, 
as he grudgingly sacrifices himself for theirs, but he knows that the 
relationship will bring mutual resentment, not pleasure — and that, morally, 
their pursuit of values will be like an exchange of unwanted, unchosen 
Christmas presents, which neither is morally permitted to buy for himself 
Apart from such times as he manages to perform some act of self-sacrifice, 
he possesses no moral significance: morality takes no cognizance of him and 
has nothing to say to him for guidance in the crucial issues of his life; it is 
only his own personal, private, “selfish” life and, as such, it is regarded 
either as evil or, at best, amoral. 

Since nature does not provide man with an automatic form of survival, 
since he has to support his life by his own effort, the doctrine that concern 
with one’s own interests is evil means that man’s desire to live is evil — that 
man’s life, as such, is evil. No doctrine could be more evil than that. 


6 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


Yet that is the meaning of altruism, implicit in such examples as the 
equation of an industrialist with a robber. There is a fundamental moral 
difference between a man who sees his self-interest in production and a man 
who sees it in robbery. The evil of a robber does not lie in the fact that he 
pursues his own interests, but in what he regards as to his own interest; not 
in the fact that he pursues his values, but in what he chose to value; not in 
the fact that he wants to live, but in the fact that he wants to live on a 
subhuman level (see “The Objectivist Ethics”). 

If it is true that what I mean by “selfishness” is not what is meant 
conventionally, then this is one of the worst indictments of altruism: it 
means that altruism permits no concept of a self-respecting, self-supporting 
man — a man who supports his life by his own effort and neither sacrifices 
himself nor others. It means that altruism permits no view of men except as 
sacrificial animals and profiteers-on-sacrifice, as victims and parasites — that 
it permits no concept of a benevolent co-existence among men — that it 
permits no concept of justice. 

If you wonder about the reasons behind the ugly mixture of cynicism and 
guilt in which most men spend their lives, these are the reasons: cynicism, 
because they neither practice nor accept the altruist morality — guilt, because 
they dare not reject it. 

To rebel against so devastating an evil, one has to rebel against its basic 
premise. To redeem both man and morality, it is the concept of “selfishness” 
that one has to redeem. 

The first step is to assert man’s right to a moral existence — that is: to 
recognize his need of a moral code to guide the course and the fulfillment of 
his own life. 

For a brief outline of the nature and the validation of a rational morality, 
see my lecture on “The Objectivist Ethics” which follows. The reasons why 
man needs a moral code will tell you that the purpose of morality is to define 
man’s proper values and interests, that concern with his own interests is the 
essence of a moral existence, and that man must be the beneficiary of his 
own moral actions. 

Since all values have to be gained and/or kept by men’s actions, any 
breach between actor and beneficiary necessitates an injustice: the sacrifice 
of some men to others, of the actors to the nonactors, of the moral to the 
immoral. Nothing could ever justify such a breach, and no one ever has. 

The choice of the beneficiary of moral values is merely a preliminary or 
introductory issue in the field of morality. It is not a substitute for morality 
nor a criterion of moral value, as altruism has made it. Neither is it a moral 


7 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


primary : it has to be derived from and validated by the fundamental 
premises of a moral system. 

The Objectivist ethics holds that the actor must always be the beneficiary 
of his action and that man must act for his own rational self-interest. But his 
right to do so is derived from his nature as man and from the function of 
moral values in human life — and, therefore, is applicable only in the context 
of a rational, objectively demonstrated and validated code of moral 
principles which define and determine his actual self-interest. It is not a 
license “to do as he pleases” and it is not applicable to the altruists’ image of 
a “selfish” brute nor to any man motivated by irrational emotions, feelings, 
urges, wishes or whims. 

This is said as a warning against the kind of “Nietzschean egoists” who, in 
fact, are a product of the altruist morality and represent the other side of the 
altruist coin: the men who believe that any action, regardless of its nature, is 
good if it is intended for one’s own benefit. Just as the satisfaction of the 
irrational desires of others is not a criterion of moral value, neither is the 
satisfaction of one’s own irrational desires. Morality is not a contest of 
whims. (See Mr. Branden’s articles “Counterfeit Individualism” and “Isn’t 
Everyone Selfish?” which follow.) 

A similar type of error is committed by the man who declares that since 
man must be guided by his own independent judgment, any action he 
chooses to take is moral if he chooses it. One’s own independent judgment is 
the means by which one must choose one’s actions, but it is not a moral 
criterion nor a moral validation: only reference to a demonstrable principle 
can validate one’s choices. 

Just as man cannot survive by any random means, but must discover and 
practice the principles which his survival requires, so man’s self-interest 
cannot be determined by blind desires or random whims, but must be 
discovered and achieved by the guidance of rational principles. This is why 
the Objectivist ethics is a morality of rational self-interest — or of rational 
selfishness. 

Since selfishness is “concern with one’s own interests,” the Objectivist 
ethics uses that concept in its exact and purest sense. It is not a concept that 
one can surrender to man’s enemies, nor to the unthinking misconceptions, 
distortions, prejudices and fears of the ignorant and the irrational. The attack 
on “selfishness” is an attack on man’s self-esteem; to surrender one, is to 
surrender the other. 

Now a word about the material in this book. With the exception of the 
lecture on ethics, it is a collection of essays that have appeared in The 
Objectivist Newsletter, a monthly journal of ideas, edited and published by

Nathaniel Branden and myself. The Newsletter deals with the application of 
the philosophy of Objectivism to the issues and problems of today’s 
culture — more specifically, with that intermediary level of intellectual 
concern which lies between philosophical abstractions and the journalistic 
concretes of day-by-day existence. Its purpose is to provide its readers with a 
consistent philosophical frame of reference. 

This collection is not a systematic discussion of ethics, but a series of 
essays on those ethical subjects which needed clarification, in today’s 
context, or which had been most confused by altruism’s influence. You may 
observe that the titles of some of the essays are in the form of a question. 
These come from our “Intellectual Ammunition Department” that answers 
questions sent in by our readers.

1. The Objectivist Ethics 

by Ayn Rand 


Since I am to speak on the Objectivist Ethics, I shall begin by quoting its 
best representative — John Galt, in Atlas Shrugged : 

“Through centuries of scourges and disasters, brought about by your code 
of morality, you have cried that your code had been broken, that the 
scourges were punishment for breaking it, that men were too weak and too 
selfish to spill all the blood it required. You damned man, you damned 
existence, you damned this earth, but never dared to question your code. ... 
You went on crying that your code was noble, but human nature was not 
good enough to practice it. And no one rose to ask the question: Good? — by 
what standard? 

“You wanted to know John Galt’s identity. I am the man who has asked 
that question. 

“Yes, this is an age of moral crisis. ... Your moral code has reached its 
climax, the blind alley at the end of its course. And if you wish to go on 
living, what you now need is not to return to morality ... but to discover it .” 1 

What is morality, or ethics? It is a code of values to guide man’s choices 
and actions — the choices and actions that determine the purpose and the 
course of his life. Ethics, as a science, deals with discovering and defining 
such a code. 

The first question that has to be answered, as a precondition of any 
attempt to define, to judge or to accept any specific system of ethics, is: Why 
does man need a code of values? 

Let me stress this. The first question is not: What particular code of values 
should man accept? The first question is: Does man need values at all — and 
why? 

Is the concept of value, of “good or evil” an arbitrary human invention, 
unrelated to, underived from and unsupported by any facts of reality — or is it 
based on a metaphysical fact, on an unalterable condition of man’s 
existence? (I use the word “metaphysical” to mean: that which pertains to 
reality, to the nature of things, to existence.) Does an arbitrary human 
convention, a mere custom, decree that man must guide his actions by a set 
of principles — or is there a fact of reality that demands it? Is ethics the

Paper delivered by Ayn Rand at the University of Wisconsin Symposium on “ Ethics in Our Time ” in 
Madison, Wisconsin, on February 9, 1961. 


10 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


province of whims : of personal emotions, social edicts and mystic 
revelations — or is it the province of reason ? Is ethics a subjective luxury — 
or an objective necessity? 

In the sorry record of the history of mankind’s ethics — with a few rare, 
and unsuccessful, exceptions — moralists have regarded ethics as the 
province of whims, that is: of the irrational. Some of them did so explicitly, 
by intention — others implicitly, by default. A “whim” is a desire experi- 
enced by a person who does not know and does not care to discover its 
cause. 

No philosopher has given a rational, objectively demonstrable, scientific 
answer to the question of why man needs a code of values. So long as that 
question remained unanswered, no rational, scientific, objective code of 
ethics could be discovered or defined. The greatest of all philosophers, 
Aristotle, did not regard ethics as an exact science; he based his ethical 
system on observations of what the noble and wise men of his time chose to 
do, leaving unanswered the questions of: why they chose to do it and why he 
evaluated them as noble and wise. 

Most philosophers took the existence of ethics for granted, as the given, as 
a historical fact, and were not concerned with discovering its metaphysical 
cause or objective validation. Many of them attempted to break the 
traditional monopoly of mysticism in the field of ethics and, allegedly, to 
define a rational, scientific, nonreligious morality. But their attempts 
consisted of trying to justify them on social grounds, merely substituting 
society for God. 

The avowed mystics held the arbitrary, unaccountable “will of God” as 
the standard of the good and as the validation of their ethics. The neomystics 
replaced it with “the good of society,” thus collapsing into the circularity of 
a definition such as “the standard of the good is that which is good for 
society.” This meant, in logic — and, today, in worldwide practice — that 
“society” stands above any principles of ethics, since it is the source, 
standard and criterion of ethics, since “the good” is whatever it wills, 
whatever it happens to assert as its own welfare and pleasure. This meant 
that “society” may do anything it pleases, since “the good” is whatever it 
chooses to do because it chooses to do it. And — since there is no such entity 
as “society,” since society is only a number of individual men — this meant 
that some men (the majority or any gang that claims to be its spokesman) are 
ethically entitled to pursue any whims (or any atrocities) they desire to 
pursue, while other men are ethically obliged to spend their lives in the 
service of that gang’s desires. 


11 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


This could hardly be called rational, yet most philosophers have now 
decided to declare that reason has failed, that ethics is outside the power of 
reason, that no rational ethics can ever be defined, and that in the field of 
ethics — in the choice of his values, of his actions, of his pursuits, of his life’s 
goals — man must be guided by something other than reason. By what? 
Faith — instinct — intuition — revelation — feeling — taste — urge — wish — 
whim. Today, as in the past, most philosophers agree that the ultimate 
standard of ethics is whim (they call it “arbitrary postulate” or “subjective 
choice” or “emotional commitment”) — and the battle is only over the 
question or whose whim: one’s own or society’s or the dictator’s or God’s. 
Whatever else they may disagree about, today’s moralists agree that ethics is 
a subjective issue and that the three things barred from its field are: reason — 
mind — reality. 

If you wonder why the world is now collapsing to a lower and ever lower 
rung of hell, this is the reason. 

If you want to save civilization, it is this premise of modem ethics — and 
of all ethical history — that you must challenge. 

To challenge the basic premise of any discipline, one must begin at the 
beginning. In ethics, one must begin by asking: What are values ? Why does 
man need them? 

“Value” is that which one acts to gain and/or keep. The concept “value” is 
not a primary; it presupposes an answer to the question: of value to whom 
and for wha fl It presupposes an entity capable of acting to achieve a goal in 
the face of an alternative. Where no alternative exists, no goals and no 
values are possible. 

I quote from Galt’s speech: “There is only one fundamental alternative in 
the universe: existence or nonexistence — and it pertains to a single class of 
entities: to living organisms. The existence of inanimate matter is 
unconditional, the existence of life is not: it depends on a specific course of 
action. Matter is indestructible, it changes its forms, but it cannot cease to 
exist. It is only a living organism that faces a constant alternative: the issue 
of life or death. Life is a process of self-sustaining and self-generated action. 
If an organism fails in that action, it dies; its chemical elements remain, but 
its life goes out of existence. It is only the concept of ‘Life’ that makes the 
concept of ‘Value’ possible. It is only to a living entity that things can be 
good or evil.” 

To make this point fully clear, try to imagine an immortal, indestmctible 
robot, an entity which moves and acts, but which cannot be affected by 
anything, which cannot be changed in any respect, which cannot be 
damaged, injured or destroyed. Such an entity would not be able to have any 


12 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


values; it would have nothing to gain or to lose; it could not regard anything 
as for or against it, as serving or threatening its welfare, as fulfilling or 
frustrating its interests. It could have no interests and no goals. 

Only a living entity can have goals or can originate them. And it is only a 
living organism that has the capacity for self-generated, goal-directed action. 
On the physical level, the functions of all living organisms, from the 
simplest to the most complex — from the nutritive function in the single cell 
of an amoeba to the blood circulation in the body of a man — are actions 

generated by the organism itself and directed to a single goal: the 

2 

maintenance of the organism’s life. 

An organism’s life depends on two factors: the material or fuel which it 
needs from the outside, from its physical background, and the action of its 
own body, the action of using that fuel properly. What standard determines 
what is proper in this context? The standard is the organism’s life, or: that 
which is required for the organism’s survival. 

No choice is open to an organism in this issue: that which is required for 
its survival is determined by its nature, by the kind of entity it is. Many 
variations, many forms of adaptation to its background are possible to an 
organism, including the possibility of existing for a while in a crippled, 
disabled or diseased condition, but the fundamental alternative of its 
existence remains the same: if an organism fails in the basic functions 
required by its nature — if an amoeba’s protoplasm stops assimilating food, 
or if a man’s heart stops beating — the organism dies. In a fundamental sense, 
stillness is the antithesis of life. Life can be kept in existence only by a 
constant process of self-sustaining action. The goal of that action, the 
ultimate value which, to be kept, must be gained through its every moment, 
is the organism’s life. 

An ultimate value is that final goal or end to which all lesser goals are the 
means — and it sets the standard by which all lesser goals are evaluated. An 
organism’s life is its standard of value : that which furthers its life is the 
good, that which threatens it is the evil. 

Without an ultimate goal or end, there can be no lesser goals or means: a 
series of means going off into an infinite progression toward a nonexistent 
end is a metaphysical and epistemological impossibility. It is only an 
ultimate goal, an end in itself, that makes the existence of values possible. 


2 When applied to physical phenomena, such as the automatic functions of an organism, the term “goal- 
directed” is not to be taken to mean “purposive” (a concept applicable only to the actions of a con- 
sciousness) and is not to imply the existence of any teleological principle operating in insentient nature. I 
use the term “goal-directed,” in this context, to designate the fact that the automatic functions of living 
organisms are actions whose nature is such that they result in the preservation of an organism’s life.

Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


Metaphysically, life is the only phenomenon that is an end in itself: a value 
gained and kept by a constant process of action. Epistemologically, the 
concept of “value” is genetically dependent upon and derived from the 
antecedent concept of “life.” To speak of “value” as apart from “life” is 
worse than a contradiction in terms. “It is only the concept of ‘Life’ that 
makes the concept of ‘Value’ possible.” 

In answer to those philosophers who claim that no relation can be 
established between ultimate ends or values and the facts of reality, let me 
stress that the fact that living entities exist and function necessitates the 
existence of values and of an ultimate value which for any given living 
entity is its own life. Thus the validation of value judgments is to be 
achieved by reference to the facts of reality. The fact that a living entity is, 
determines what it ought to do. So much for the issue of the relation between 
“/.s'” and “ought.” 

Now in what manner does a human being discover the concept of 
“ value ”? By what means does he first become aware of the issue of “good or 
evil” in its simplest form? By means of the physical sensations of pleasure 
or pain. Just as sensations are the first step of the development of a human 
consciousness in the realm of cognition , so they are its first step in the realm 
of evaluation. 

The capacity to experience pleasure or pain is innate in a man’s body; it is 
part of his nature, part of the kind of entity he is. He has no choice about it, 
and he has no choice about the standard that determines what will make him 
experience the physical sensation of pleasure or of pain. What is that 
standard? His life. 

The pleasure-pain mechanism in the body of man — and in the bodies of 
all the living organisms that possess the faculty of consciousness — serves as 
an automatic guardian of the organism’s life. The physical sensation of 
pleasure is a signal indicating that the organism is pursuing the right course 
of action. The physical sensation of pain is a warning signal of danger, 
indicating that the organism is pursuing the wrong course of action, that 
something is impairing the proper function of its body, which requires action 
to correct it. The best illustration of this can be seen in the rare, freak cases 
of children who are born without the capacity to experience physical pain; 
such children do not survive for long; they have no means of discovering 
what can injure them, no warning signals, and thus a minor cut can develop 
into a deadly infection, or a major illness can remain undetected until it is 
too late to fight it. 

Consciousness — for those living organisms which possess it — is the basic 
means of survival.

Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


The simpler organisms, such as plants, can survive by means of their 
automatic physical functions. The higher organisms, such as animals and 
man, cannot: their needs are more complex and the range of their actions is 
wider. The physical functions of their bodies can perform automatically only 
the task of using fuel, but cannot obtain that fuel. To obtain it, the higher 
organisms need the faculty of consciousness. A plant can obtain its food 
from the soil in which it grows. An animal has to hunt for it. Man has to 
produce it. 

A plant has no choice of action; the goals it pursues are automatic and 
innate, determined by its nature. Nourishment, water, sunlight are the values 
its nature has set it to seek. Its life is the standard of value directing its 
actions. There are alternatives in the conditions it encounters in its physical 
background — such as heat or frost, drought or flood — and there are certain 
actions which it is able to perform to combat adverse conditions, such as the 
ability of some plants to grow and crawl from under a rock to reach the 
sunlight. But whatever the conditions, there is no alternative in a plant’s 
function: it acts automatically to further its life, it cannot act for its own 
destruction. 

The range of actions required for the survival of the higher organisms is 
wider: it is proportionate to the range of their consciousness. The lower of 
the conscious species possess only the faculty of sensation, which is 
sufficient to direct their actions and provide for their needs. A sensation is 
produced by the automatic reaction of a sense organ to a stimulus from the 
outside world; it lasts for the duration of the immediate moment, as long as 
the stimulus lasts and no longer. Sensations are an automatic response, an 
automatic form of knowledge, which a consciousness can neither seek nor 
evade. An organism that possesses only the faculty of sensation is guided by 
the pleasure -pain mechanism of its body, that is: by an automatic knowledge 
and an automatic code of values. Its life is the standard of value directing its 
actions. Within the range of action possible to it, it acts automatically to 
further its life and cannot act for its own destruction. 

The higher organisms possess a much more potent form of consciousness: 
they possess the faculty of retaining sensations, which is the faculty of 
perception. A “perception” is a group of sensations automatically retained 
and integrated by the brain of a living organism, which gives it the ability to 
be aware, not of single stimuli, but of entities, of things. An animal is 
guided, not merely by immediate sensations, but by percepts. Its actions are 
not single, discrete responses to single, separate stimuli, but are directed by 
an integrated awareness of the perceptual reality confronting it. It is able to 
grasp the perceptual concretes immediately present and it is able to form 


15 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


automatic perceptual associations, but it can go no further. It is able to learn 
certain skills to deal with specific situations, such as hunting or hiding, 
which the parents of the higher animals teach their young. But an animal has 
no choice in the knowledge and the skills that it acquires; it can only repeat 
them generation after generation. And an animal has no choice in the 
standard of value directing its actions: its senses provide it with an automatic 
code of values, an automatic knowledge of what is good for it or evil, what 
benefits or endangers its life. An animal has no power to extend its 
knowledge or to evade it. In situations for which its knowledge is 
inadequate, it perishes — as, for instance, an animal that stands paralyzed on 
the track of a railroad in the path of a speeding train. But so long as it lives, 
an animal acts on its knowledge, with automatic safety and no power of 
choice: it cannot suspend its own consciousness — it cannot choose not to 
perceive — it cannot evade its own perceptions — it cannot ignore its own 
good, it cannot decide to choose the evil and act as its own destroyer. 

Man has no automatic code of survival. He has no automatic course of 
action, no automatic set of values. His senses do not tell him automatically 
what is good for him or evil, what will benefit his life or endanger it, what 
goals he should pursue and what means will achieve them, what values his 
life depends on, what course of action it requires. His own consciousness has 
to discover the answers to all these questions — but his consciousness will 
not function automatically. Man, the highest living species on this earth — 
the being whose consciousness has a limitless capacity for gaining 
knowledge — man is the only living entity bom without any guarantee of 
remaining conscious at all. Man’s particular distinction from all other living 
species is the fact that his consciousness is volitional. 

Just as the automatic values directing the functions of a plant’s body are 
sufficient for its survival, but are not sufficient for an animal’s — so the 
automatic values provided by the sensory-perceptual mechanism of its 
consciousness are sufficient to guide an animal, but are not sufficient for 
man. Man’s actions and survival require the guidance of conceptual values 
derived from conceptual knowledge. But conceptual knowledge cannot be 
acquired automatically. 

A “ concept ” is a mental integration of two or more perceptual concretes, 
which are isolated by a process of abstraction and united by means of a 
specific definition. Every word of man’s language, with the exception of 
proper names, denotes a concept, an abstraction that stands for an unlimited 
number of concretes of a specific kind. It is by organizing his perceptual 
material into concepts, and his concepts into wider and still wider concepts 
that man is able to grasp and retain, to identify and integrate an unlimited 


16 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


amount of knowledge, a knowledge extending beyond the immediate 
perceptions of any given, immediate moment. Man’s sense organs function 
automatically; man’s brain integrates his sense data into percepts 
automatically; but the process of integrating percepts into concepts — the 
process of abstraction and of concept-formation — is not automatic. 

The process of concept-formation does not consist merely of grasping a 
few simple abstractions, such as “chair,” “table,” “hot,” “cold,” and of 
learning to speak. It consists of a method of using one’s consciousness, best 
designated by the term “conceptualizing.” It is not a passive state of 
registering random impressions. It is an actively sustained process of 
identifying one’s impressions in conceptual terms, of integrating every event 
and every observation into a conceptual context, of grasping relationships, 
differences, similarities in one’s perceptual material and of abstracting them 
into new concepts, of drawing inferences, of making deductions, of reaching 
conclusions, of asking new questions and discovering new answers and 
expanding one’s knowledge into an ever-growing sum. The faculty that 
directs this process, the faculty that works by means of concepts, is: reason. 
The process is thinking. 

Reason is the faculty that identifies and integrates the material provided 
by man’s senses. It is a faculty that man has to exercise by choice. Thinking 
is not an automatic function. In any hour and issue of his life, man is free to 
think or to evade that effort. Thinking requires a state of full, focused 
awareness. The act of focusing one’s consciousness is volitional. Man can 
focus his mind to a full, active, purposefully directed awareness of reality — 
or he can unfocus it and let himself drift in a semiconscious daze, merely re- 
acting to any chance stimulus of the immediate moment, at the mercy of his 
undirected sensory-perceptual mechanism and of any random, associational 
connections it might happen to make. 

When man unfocuses his mind, he may be said to be conscious in a 
subhuman sense of the word, since he experiences sensations and 
perceptions. But in the sense of the word applicable to man — in the sense of 
a consciousness which is aware of reality and able to deal with it, a con- 
sciousness able to direct the actions and provide for the survival of a human 
being — an unfocused mind is not conscious. 

Psychologically, the choice “to think or not” is the choice “to focus or 
not.” Existentially, the choice “to focus or not” is the choice “to be 
conscious or not.” Metaphysically, the choice “to be conscious or not” is the 
choice of life or death. 

Consciousness — for those living organisms which possess it — is the basic 
means of survival. For man, the basic means of survival is reason. Man 


17 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


cannot survive, as animals do, by the guidance of mere percepts. A sensation 
of hunger will tell him that he needs food (if he has learned to identify it as 
“hunger”), but it will not tell him how to obtain his food and it will not tell 
him what food is good for him or poisonous. He cannot provide for his 
simplest physical needs without a process of thought. He needs a process of 
thought to discover how to plant and grow his food or how to make weapons 
for hunting. His percepts might lead him to a cave, if one is available — but 
to build the simplest shelter, he needs a process of thought. No percepts and 
no “instincts” will tell him how to light a fire, how to weave cloth, how to 
forge tools, how to make a wheel, how to make an airplane, how to perform 
an appendectomy, how to produce an electric light bulb or an electronic tube 
or a cyclotron or a box of matches. Yet his life depends on such 
knowledge — and only a volitional act of his consciousness, a process of 
thought, can provide it. 

But man’s responsibility goes still further: a process of thought is not 
automatic nor “instinctive” nor involuntary — nor infallible. Man has to 
initiate it, to sustain it and to bear responsibility for its results. He has to 
discover how to tell what is true or false and how to correct his own errors; 
he has to discover how to validate his concepts, his conclusions, his 
knowledge; he has to discover the rules of thought, the laws of logic , to 
direct his thinking. Nature gives him no automatic guarantee of the efficacy 
of his mental effort. 

Nothing is given to man on earth except a potential and the material on 
which to actualize it. The potential is a superlative machine: his 
consciousness; but it is a machine without a spark plug, a machine of which 
his own will has to be the spark plug, the self-starter and the driver; he has to 
discover how to use it and he has to keep it in constant action. The material 
is the whole of the universe, with no limits set to the knowledge he can 
acquire and to the enjoyment of life he can achieve. But everything he needs 
or desires has to be learned, discovered and produced by him — by his own 
choice, by his own effort, by his own mind. 

A being who does not know automatically what is true or false, cannot 
know automatically what is right or wrong, what is good for him or evil. Yet 
he needs that knowledge in order to live. He is not exempt from the laws of 
reality, he is a specific organism of a specific nature that requires specific 
actions to sustain his life. He cannot achieve his survival by arbitrary means 
nor by random motions nor by blind urges nor by chance nor by whim. That 
which his survival requires is set by his nature and is not open to his choice. 
What is open to his choice is only whether he will discover it or not, whether 
he will choose the right goals and values or not. He is free to make the 


18 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


wrong choice, but not free to succeed with it. He is free to evade reality, he 
is free to unfocus his mind and stumble blindly down any road he pleases, 
but not free to avoid the abyss he refuses to see. Knowledge, for any 
conscious organism, is the means of survival; to a living consciousness, 
every “is” implies an “ ought .” Man is free to choose not to be conscious, but 
not free to escape the penalty of unconsciousness: destruction. Man is the 
only living species that has the power to act as his own destroyer — and that 
is the way he has acted through most of his history. 

What, then, are the right goals for man to pursue? What are the values his 
survival requires? That is the question to be answered by the science of 
ethics. And this, ladies and gentlemen, is why man needs a code of ethics. 

Now you can assess the meaning of the doctrines which tell you that 
ethics is the province of the irrational, that reason cannot guide man’s life, 
that his goals and values should be chosen by vote or by whim — that ethics 
has nothing to do with reality, with existence, with one’s practical actions 
and concerns — or that the goal of ethics is beyond the grave, that the dead 
need ethics, not the living. 

Ethics is not a mystic fantasy — nor a social convention — nor a 
dispensable, subjective luxury, to be switched or discarded in any 
emergency. Ethics is an objective, metaphysical necessity of man ’s 
survival — not by the grace of the supernatural nor of your neighbors nor of 
your whims, but by the grace of reality and the nature of life. 

I quote from Galt’s speech: “Man has been called a rational being, but 
rationality is a matter of choice — and the alternative his nature offers him is: 
rational being or suicidal animal. Man has to be man — by choice; he has to 
hold his life as a value — by choice; he has to leam to sustain it — by choice; 
he has to discover the values it requires and practice his virtues — by choice. 
A code of values accepted by choice is a code of morality.” 

The standard of value of the Objectivist ethics — the standard by which 
one judges what is good or evil — is man ’s life, or: that which is required for 
man’s survival qua man. 

Since reason is man’s basic means of survival, that which is proper to the 
life of a rational being is the good; that which negates, opposes or destroys it 
is the evil. 

Since everything man needs has to be discovered by his own mind and 
produced by his own effort, the two essentials of the method of survival 
proper to a rational being are: thinking and productive work. 

If some men do not choose to think, but survive by imitating and 
repeating, like trained animals, the routine of sounds and motions they 
learned from others, never making an effort to understand their own work, it 


19 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


still remains true that their survival is made possible only by those who did 
choose to think and to discover the motions they are repeating. The survival 
of such mental parasites depends on blind chance; their unfocused minds are 
unable to know whom to imitate, whose motions it is safe to follow. They are 
the men who march into the abyss, trailing after any destroyer who promises 
them to assume the responsibility they evade: the responsibility of being 
conscious. 

If some men attempt to survive by means of brute force or fraud, by 
looting, robbing, cheating or enslaving the men who produce, it still remains 
true that their survival is made possible only by their victims, only by the 
men who choose to think and to produce the goods which they, the looters, 
are seizing. Such looters are parasites incapable of survival, who exist by 
destroying those who are capable, those who are pursuing a course of action 
proper to man. 

The men who attempt to survive, not by means of reason, but by means of 
force, are attempting to survive by the method of animals. But just as 
animals would not be able to survive by attempting the method of plants, by 
rejecting locomotion and waiting for the soil to feed them — so men cannot 
survive by attempting the method of animals, by rejecting reason and 
counting on productive men to serve as their prey. Such looters may achieve 
their goals for the range of a moment, at the price of destruction: the destruc- 
tion of their victims and their own. As evidence, I offer you any criminal or 
any dictatorship. 

Man cannot survive, like an animal, by acting on the range of the moment. 
An animal’s life consists of a series of separate cycles, repeated over and 
over again, such as the cycle of breeding its young, or of storing food for the 
winter; an animal’s consciousness cannot integrate its entire lifespan; it can 
carry just so far, then the animal has to begin the cycle all over again, with 
no connection to the past. Man ’s life is a continuous whole: for good or evil, 
every day, year and decade of his life holds the sum of all the days behind 
him. He can alter his choices, he is free to change the direction of his course, 
he is even free, in many cases, to atone for the consequences of his past — 
but he is not free to escape them, nor to live his life with impunity on the 
range of the moment, like an animal, a playboy or a thug. If he is to succeed 
at the task of survival, if his actions are not to be aimed at his own 
destruction, man has to choose his course, his goals, his values in the context 
and terms of a lifetime. No sensations, percepts, urges or “instincts” can do 
it; only a mind can. 

Such is the meaning of the definition: that which is required for man’s 
survival qua man. It does not mean a momentary or a merely physical 


20 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


survival. It does not mean the momentary physical survival of a mindless 
brute, waiting for another brute to crush his skull. It does not mean the 
momentary physical survival of a crawling aggregate of muscles who is 
willing to accept any terms, obey any thug and surrender any values, for the 
sake of what is known as “survival at any price,” which may or may not last 
a week or a year. “Man’s survival qua man” means the terms, methods, 
conditions and goals required for the survival of a rational being through the 
whole of his lifespan — in all those aspects of existence which are open to his 
choice. 

Man cannot survive as anything but man. He can abandon his means of 
survival, his mind, he can turn himself into a subhuman creature and he can 
turn his life into a brief span of agony — just as his body can exist for a while 
in the process of disintegration by disease. But he cannot succeed, as a 
subhuman, in achieving anything but the subhuman — as the ugly horror of 
the antirational periods of mankind’s history can demonstrate. Man has to be 
man by choice — and it is the task of ethics to teach him how to live like 
man. 

The Objectivist ethics holds man’s life as the standard of value — and his 
own life as the ethical purpose of every individual man. 

The difference between “standard” and “purpose” in this context is as 
follows: a “standard” is an abstract principle that serves as a measurement or 
gauge to guide a man’s choices in the achievement of a concrete, specific 
purpose. “That which is required for the survival of man qua man” is an 
abstract principle that applies to every individual man. The task of applying 
this principle to a concrete, specific purpose — the purpose of living a life 
proper to a rational being — belongs to every individual man, and the life he 
has to live is his own. 

Man must choose his actions, values and goals by the standard of that 
which is proper to man — in order to achieve, maintain, fulfill and enjoy that 
ultimate value, that end in itself, which is his own life. 

Value is that which one acts to gain and/or keep — virtue is the act by 
which one gains and/or keeps it. The three cardinal values of the Objectivist 
ethics — the three values which, together, are the means to and the realization 
of one’s ultimate value, one’s own life — are: Reason, Purpose, Self-Esteem, 
with their three corresponding virtues: Rationality, Productiveness, Pride. 

Productive work is the central purpose of a rational man’s life, the central 
value that integrates and determines the hierarchy of all his other values. 
Reason is the source, the precondition of his productive work — pride is the 
result. 


21 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


Rationality is man’s basic virtue, the source of all his other virtues. Man’s 
basic vice, the source of all his evils, is the act of unfocusing his mind, the 
suspension of his consciousness, which is not blindness, but the refusal to 
see, not ignorance, but the refusal to know. Irrationality is the rejection of 
man’s means of survival and, therefore, a commitment to a course of blind 
destruction; that which is anti-mind, is anti-life. 

The virtue of Rationality means the recognition and acceptance of reason 
as one’s only source of knowledge, one’s only judge of values and one’s 
only guide to action. It means one’s total commitment to a state of full, 
conscious awareness, to the maintenance of a full mental focus in all issues, 
in all choices, in all of one’s waking hours. It means a commitment to the 
fullest perception of reality within one’s power and to the constant, active 
expansion of one’s perception, i.e., of one’s knowledge. It means a 
commitment to the reality of one’s own existence, i.e., to the principle that 
all of one’s goals, values and actions take place in reality and, therefore, that 
one must never place any value or consideration whatsoever above one’s 
perception of reality. It means a commitment to the principle that all of one’s 
convictions, values, goals, desires and actions must be based on, derived 
from, chosen and validated by a process of thought — as precise and 
scrupulous a process of thought, directed by as ruthlessly strict an 
application of logic, as one’s fullest capacity permits. It means one’s 
acceptance of the responsibility of forming one’s own judgments and of 
living by the work of one’s own mind (which is the virtue of Independence). 
It means that one must never sacrifice one’s convictions to the opinions or 
wishes of others (which is the virtue of Integrity) — that one must never 
attempt to fake reality in any manner (which is the virtue of Honesty) — that 
one must never seek or grant the unearned and undeserved, neither in matter 
nor in spirit (which is the virtue of Justice). It means that one must never 
desire effects without causes, and that one must never enact a cause without 
assuming full responsibility for its effects — that one must never act like a 
zombie, i.e., without knowing one’s own purposes and motives — that one 
must never make any decisions, form any convictions or seek any values out 
of context, i.e., apart from or against the total, integrated sum of one’s 
knowledge — and, above all, that one must never seek to get away with 
contradictions. It means the rejection of any form of mysticism, i.e., any 
claim to some nonsensory, nonrational, nondefmable, supernatural source of 
knowledge. It means a commitment to reason, not in sporadic fits or on 
selected issues or in special emergencies, but as a permanent way of life. 

The virtue of Productiveness is the recognition of the fact that productive 
work is the process by which man’s mind sustains his life, the process that 


22 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


sets man free of the necessity to adjust himself to his background, as all 
animals do, and gives him the power to adjust his background to himself. 
Productive work is the road of man’s unlimited achievement and calls upon 
the highest attributes of his character: his creative ability, his ambitiousness, 
his self-assertiveness, his refusal to bear uncontested disasters, his dedication 
to the goal of reshaping the earth in the image of his values. “Productive 
work” does not mean the unfocused performance of the motions of some 
job. It means the consciously chosen pursuit of a productive career, in any 
line of rational endeavor, great or modest, on any level of ability. It is not the 
degree of a man’s ability nor the scale of his work that is ethically relevant 
here, but the fullest and most purposeful use of his mind. 

The virtue of Pride is the recognition of the fact “that as man must 
produce the physical values he needs to sustain his life, so he must acquire 
the values of character that make his life worth sustaining — that as man is a 
being of self-made wealth, so he is a being of self-made soul.” (Atlas 
Shrugged.) The virtue of Pride can best be described by the term: “moral 
ambitiousness.” It means that one must earn the right to hold oneself as 
one’s own highest value by achieving one’s own moral perfection — which 
one achieves by never accepting any code of irrational virtues impossible to 
practice and by never failing to practice the virtues one knows to be 
rational — by never accepting an unearned guilt and never earning any, or, if 
one has earned it, never leaving it uncorrected — by never resigning oneself 
passively to any flaws in one’s character — by never placing any concern, 
wish, fear or mood of the moment above the reality of one’s own self- 
esteem. And, above all, it means one’s rejection of the role of a sacrificial 
animal, the rejection of any doctrine that preaches self-immolation as a 
moral virtue or duty. 

The basic social principle of the Objectivist ethics is that just as life is an 
end in itself, so every living human being is an end in himself, not the means 
to the ends or the welfare of others — and, therefore, that man must live for 
his own sake, neither sacrificing himself to others nor sacrificing others to 
himself. To live for his own sake means that the achievement of his own 
happiness is man ’s highest moral purpose. 

In psychological terms, the issue of man’s survival does not confront his 
consciousness as an issue of “life or death,” but as an issue of “happiness or 
suffering.” Happiness is the successful state of life, suffering is the warning 
signal of failure, of death. Just as the pleasure-pain mechanism of man’s 
body is an automatic indicator of his body’s welfare or injury, a barometer 
of its basic alternative, life or death — so the emotional mechanism of man’s 
consciousness is geared to perform the same function, as a barometer that 


23 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


registers the same alternative by means of two basic emotions: joy or 
suffering. Emotions are the automatic results of man’s value judgments 
integrated by his subconscious; emotions are estimates of that which furthers 
man’s values or threatens them, that which is for him or against him — 
lightning calculators giving him the sum of his profit or loss. 

But while the standard of value operating the physical pleasure-pain 
mechanism of man’s body is automatic and innate, determined by the nature 
of his body — the standard of value operating his emotional mechanism, is 
not. Since man has no automatic knowledge, he can have no automatic 
values; since he has no innate ideas, he can have no innate value judgments. 

Man is bom with an emotional mechanism, just as he is born with a 
cognitive mechanism; but, at birth, both are “tabula rasa.” It is man’s 
cognitive faculty, his mind, that determines the content of both. Man’s 
emotional mechanism is like an electronic computer, which his mind has to 
program — and the programming consists of the values his mind chooses. 

But since the work of man’s mind is not automatic, his values, like all his 
premises, are the product either of his thinking or of his evasions: man 
chooses his values by a conscious process of thought — or accepts them by 
default, by subconscious associations, on faith, on someone’s authority, by 
some form of social osmosis or blind imitation. Emotions are produced by 
man’s premises, held consciously or subconsciously, explicitly or implicitly. 

Man has no choice about his capacity to feel that something is good for 
him or evil, but what he will consider good or evil, what will give him joy or 
pain, what he will love or hate, desire or fear, depends on his standard of 
value. If he chooses irrational values, he switches his emotional mechanism 
from the role of his guardian to the role of his destroyer. The irrational is the 
impossible; it is that which contradicts the facts of reality; facts cannot be 
altered by a wish, but they can destroy the wisher. If a man desires and 
pursues contradictions — if he wants to have his cake and eat it, too — he 
disintegrates his consciousness; he turns his inner life into a civil war of 
blind forces engaged in dark, incoherent, pointless, meaningless conflicts 
(which, incidentally, is the inner state of most people today). 

Happiness is that state of consciousness which proceeds from the 
achievement of one’s values. If a man values productive work, his happiness 
is the measure of his success in the service of his life. But if a man values 
destruction, like a sadist — or self-torture, like a masochist — or life beyond 
the grave, like a mystic — or mindless “kicks,” like the driver of a hotrod 
car — his alleged happiness is the measure of his success in the service of his 
own destruction. It must be added that the emotional state of all those

Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


irrationalists cannot be properly designated as happiness or even as pleasure: 
it is merely a moment’s relief from their chronic state of terror. 

Neither life nor happiness can be achieved by the pursuit of irrational 
whims. Just as man is free to attempt to survive by any random means, as a 
parasite, a moocher or a looter, but not free to succeed at it beyond the range 
of the moment — so he is free to seek his happiness in any irrational fraud, 
any whim, any delusion, any mindless escape from reality, but not free to 
succeed at it beyond the range of the moment nor to escape the 
consequences. 

I quote from Galt’s speech: “Happiness is a state of non-contradictory 
joy — a joy without penalty or guilt, a joy that does not clash with any of 
your values and does not work for your own destruction. ... Happiness is 
possible only to a rational man, the man who desires nothing but rational 
goals, seeks nothing but rational values and finds his joy in nothing but 
rational actions.” 

The maintenance of life and the pursuit of happiness are not two separate 
issues. To hold one’s own life as one’s ultimate value, and one’s own 
happiness as one’s highest purpose are two aspects of the same achievement. 
Existentially, the activity of pursuing rational goals is the activity of 
maintaining one’s life; psychologically, its result, reward and concomitant is 
an emotional state of happiness. It is by experiencing happiness that one 
lives one’s life, in any hour, year or the whole of it. And when one 
experiences the kind of pure happiness that is an end in itself — the kind that 
makes one think: “This is worth living for” — what one is greeting and 
affirming in emotional terms is the metaphysical fact that life is an end in 
itself. 

But the relationship of cause to effect cannot be reversed. It is only by 
accepting “man’s life” as one’s primary and by pursuing the rational values 
it requires that one can achieve happiness — not by taking “happiness” as 
some undefined, irreducible primary and then attempting to live by its guid- 
ance. If you achieve that which is the good by a rational standard of value, it 
will necessarily make you happy; but that which makes you happy, by some 
undefined emotional standard, is not necessarily the good. To take 
“whatever makes one happy” as a guide to action means: to be guided by 
nothing but one’s emotional whims. Emotions are not tools of cognition; to 
be guided by whims — by desires whose source, nature and meaning one 
does not know — is to turn oneself into a blind robot, operated by 
unknowable demons (by one’s stale evasions), a robot knocking its stagnant 
brains out against the walls of reality which it refuses to see.

Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


This is the fallacy inherent in hedonism — in any variant of ethical 
hedonism, personal or social, individual or collective. “Happiness” can 
properly be the purpose of ethics, but not the standard. The task of ethics is 
to define man’s proper code of values and thus to give him the means of 
achieving happiness. To declare, as the ethical hedonists do, that “the proper 
value is whatever gives you pleasure” is to declare that “the proper value is 
whatever you happen to value” — which is an act of intellectual and 
philosophical abdication, an act which merely proclaims the futility of ethics 
and invites all men to play it deuces wild. 

The philosophers who attempted to devise an allegedly rational code of 
ethics gave mankind nothing but a choice of whims: the “selfish” pursuit of 
one’s own whims (such as the ethics of Nietzsche) — or “selfless” service to 
the whims of others (such as the ethics of Bentham, Mill, Comte and of all 
social hedonists, whether they allowed man to include his own whims 
among the millions of others or advised him to turn himself into a totally 
selfless “shmoo” that seeks to be eaten by others). 

When a “desire,” regardless of its nature or cause, is taken as an ethical 
primary, and the gratification of any and all desires is taken as an ethical 
goal (such as “the greatest happiness of the greatest number”) — men have no 
choice but to hate, fear and fight one another, because their desires and their 
interests will necessarily clash. If “desire” is the ethical standard, then one 
man’s desire to produce and another man’s desire to rob him have equal 
ethical validity; one man’s desire to be free and another man’s desire to 
enslave him have equal ethical validity; one man’s desire to be loved and 
admired for his virtues and another man’s desire for undeserved love and 
unearned admiration have equal ethical validity. And if the frustration of any 
desire constitutes a sacrifice , then a man who owns an automobile and is 
robbed of it, is being sacrificed, but so is the man who wants or “aspires to” 
an automobile which the owner refuses to give him — and these two 
“sacrifices” have equal ethical status. If so, then man’s only choice is to rob 
or be robbed, to destroy or be destroyed, to sacrifice others to any desire of 
his own or to sacrifice himself to any desire of others; then man’s only 
ethical alternative is to be a sadist or a masochist. 

The moral cannibalism of all hedonist and altruist doctrines lies in the 
premise that the happiness of one man necessitates the injury of another. 

Today, most people hold this premise as an absolute not to be questioned. 
And when one speaks of man’s right to exist for his own sake, for his own 
rational self-interest, most people assume automatically that this means his 
right to sacrifice others. Such an assumption is a confession of their own 
belief that to injure, enslave, rob or murder others is in man’s self-interest — 


26 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


which he must selflessly renounce. The idea that man’s self-interest can be 
served only by a non-sacrificial relationship with others has never occurred 
to those humanitarian apostles of unselfishness, who proclaim their desire to 
achieve the brotherhood of men. And it will not occur to them, or to anyone, 
so long as the concept “rational” is omitted from the context of “values,” 
“desires,” “self-interest” and ethics. 

The Objectivist ethics proudly advocates and upholds rational 
selfishness — which means: the values required for man’s survival qua 
man — which means: the values required for human survival — not the values 
produced by the desires, the emotions, the “aspirations,” the feelings, the 
whims or the needs of irrational brutes, who have never outgrown the 
primordial practice of human sacrifices, have never discovered an industrial 
society and can conceive of no self-interest but that of grabbing the loot of 
the moment. 

The Objectivist ethics holds that human good does not require human 
sacrifices and cannot be achieved by the sacrifice of anyone to anyone. It 
holds that the rational interests of men do not clash — that there is no conflict 
of interests among men who do not desire the unearned, who do not make 
sacrifices nor accept them, who deal with one another as traders, giving 
value for value. 

The principle of trade is the only rational ethical principle for all human 
relationships, personal and social, private and public, spiritual and material. 
It is the principle of justice. 

A trader is a man who earns what he gets and does not give or take the 
undeserved. He does not treat men as masters or slaves, but as independent 
equals. He deals with men by means of a free, voluntary, unforced, 
uncoerced exchange — an exchange which benefits both parties by their own 
independent judgment. A trader does not expect to be paid for his defaults, 
only for his achievements. He does not switch to others the burden of his 
failures, and he does not mortgage his life into bondage to the failures of 
others. 

In spiritual issues — (by “spiritual” I mean: “pertaining to man’s 
consciousness”) — the currency or medium of exchange is different, but the 
principle is the same. Love, friendship, respect, admiration are the emotional 
response of one man to the virtues of another, the spiritual payment given in 
exchange for the personal, selfish pleasure which one man derives from the 
virtues of another man’s character. Only a brute or an altruist would claim 
that the appreciation of another person’s virtues is an act of selflessness, that 
as far as one’s own selfish interest and pleasure are concerned, it makes no 
difference whether one deals with a genius or a fool, whether one meets a 


27 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


hero or a thug, whether one marries an ideal woman or a slut. In spiritual 
issues, a trader is a man who does not seek to be loved for his weaknesses or 
flaws, only for his virtues, and who does not grant his love to the 
weaknesses or the flaws of others, only to their virtues. 

To love is to value. Only a rationally selfish man, a man of self-esteem, is 
capable of love — because he is the only man capable of holding firm, 
consistent, uncompromising, unbetrayed values. The man who does not 
value himself, cannot value anything or anyone. 

It is only on the basis of rational selfishness — on the basis of justice — that 
men can be fit to live together in a free, peaceful, prosperous, benevolent, 
rational society. 

Can man derive any personal benefit from living in a human society? 
Y es — if it is a human society. The two great values to be gained from social 
existence are: knowledge and trade. Man is the only species that can transmit 
and expand his store of knowledge from generation to generation; the 
knowledge potentially available to man is greater than any one man could 
begin to acquire in his own life-span; every man gains an incalculable 
benefit from the knowledge discovered by others. The second great benefit 
is the division of labor: it enables a man to devote his effort to a particular 
field of work and to trade with others who specialize in other fields. This 
form of cooperation allows all men who take part in it to achieve a greater 
knowledge, skill and productive return on their effort than they could 
achieve if each had to produce everything he needs, on a desert island or on 
a self-sustaining farm. 

But these very benefits indicate, delimit and define what kind of men can 
be of value to one another and in what kind of society: only rational, 
productive, independent men in a rational, productive, free society. 
Parasites, moochers, looters, brutes and thugs can be of no value to a human 
being — nor can he gain any benefit from living in a society geared to their 
needs, demands and protection, a society that treats him as a sacrificial 
animal and penalizes him for his virtues in order to reward them for their 
vices, which means: a society based on the ethics of altruism. No society can 
be of value to man’s life if the price is the surrender of his right to his life. 

The basic political principle of the Objectivist ethics is: no man may 
initiate the use of physical force against others. No man — or group or 
society or government — has the right to assume the role of a criminal and 
initiate the use of physical compulsion against any man. Men have the right 
to use physical force only in retaliation and only against those who initiate its 
use. The ethical principle involved is simple and clear-cut: it is the 
difference between murder and self-defense. A holdup man seeks to gain a 


28 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


value, wealth, by killing his victim; the victim does not grow richer by 
killing a holdup man. The principle is: no man may obtain any values from 
others by resorting to physical force. 

The only proper, moral purpose of a government is to protect man’s 
rights, which means: to protect him from physical violence — to protect his 
right to his own life, to his own liberty, to his own property and to the 
pursuit of his own happiness. Without property rights, no other rights are 
possible. 

I will not attempt, in a brief lecture, to discuss the political theory of 
Objectivism. Those who are interested will find it presented in full detail in 
Atlas Shrugged. I will say only that every political system is based on and 
derived from a theory of ethics — and that the Objectivist ethics is the moral 
base needed by that politico-economic system which, today, is being 
destroyed all over the world, destroyed precisely for lack of a moral, 
philosophical defense and validation: the original American system, 
Capitalism. If it perishes, it will perish by default, undiscovered and 
unidentified: no other subject has ever been hidden by so many distortions, 
misconceptions and misrepresentations. Today, few people know what 
capitalism is, how it works and what was its actual history. 

When I say “capitalism,” I mean a full, pure, uncontrolled, unregulated 
laissez-faire capitalism — with a separation of state and economics, in the 
same way and for the same reasons as the separation of state and church. A 
pure system of capitalism has never yet existed, not even in America; 
various degrees of government control had been undercutting and distorting 
it from the start. Capitalism is not the system of the past; it is the system of 
the future — if mankind is to have a future. 

For those who are interested in the history and the psychological causes of 
the philosophers’ treason against capitalism, I will mention that I discuss 
them in the title essay of my book For the New Intellectual. 

The present discussion has to be confined to the subject of ethics. I have 
presented the barest essentials of my system, but they are sufficient to 
indicate in what manner the Objectivist ethics is the morality of life — as 
against the three major schools of ethical theory, the mystic, the social, the 
subjective, which have brought the world to its present state and which 
represent the morality of death. 

These three schools differ only in their method of approach, not in their 
content. In content, they are merely variants of altruism, the ethical theory 
which regards man as a sacrificial animal, which holds that man has no right

29 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


to exist for his own sake, that service to others is the only justification of his 
existence, and that self-sacrifice is his highest moral duty, virtue and value. 
The differences occur only over the question of who is to be sacrificed to 
whom. Altruism holds death as its ultimate goal and standard of value — and 
it is logical that renunciation, resignation, self-denial, and every other form 
of suffering, including self-destruction, are the virtues it advocates. And, 
logically, these are the only things that the practitioners of altruism have 
achieved and are achieving now. 

Observe that these three schools of ethical theory are anti-life, not merely 
in content, but also in their method of approach. 

The mystic theory of ethics is explicitly based on the premise that the 
standard of value of man’s ethics is set beyond the grave, by the laws or 
requirements of another, supernatural dimension, that ethics is impossible 
for man to practice, that it is unsuited for and opposed to man’s life on earth, 
and that man must take the blame for it and suffer through the whole of his 
earthly existence, to atone for the guilt of being unable to practice the 
impracticable. The Dark Ages and the Middle Ages are the existential monu- 
ment to this theory of ethics. 

The social theory of ethics substitutes “society” for God — and although it 
claims that its chief concern is life on earth, it is not the life of man, not the 
life of an individual, but the life of a disembodied entity, the collective , 
which, in relation to every individual, consists of everybody except himself. 
As far as the individual is concerned, his ethical duty is to be the selfless, 
voiceless, rightless slave of any need, claim or demand asserted by others. 
The motto “dog eat dog” — which is not applicable to capitalism nor to 
dogs — is applicable to the social theory of ethics. The existential monuments 
to this theory are Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia. 

The subjectivist theory of ethics is, strictly speaking, not a theory, but a 
negation of ethics. And more: it is a negation of reality, a negation not 
merely of man’s existence, but of all existence. Only the concept of a fluid, 
plastic, indeterminate, Heraclitean universe could permit anyone to think or 
to preach that man needs no objective principles of action — that reality gives 
him a blank check on values — that anything he cares to pick as the good or 
the evil, will do — that a man’s whim is a valid moral standard, and that the 
only question is how to get away with it. The existential monument to this 
theory is the present state of our culture. 

It is not men’s immorality that is responsible for the collapse now 
threatening to destroy the civilized world, but the kind of moralities men 
have been asked to practice. The responsibility belongs to the philosophers 
of altruism. They have no cause to be shocked by the spectacle of their own 


30 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


success, and no right to damn human nature: men have obeyed them and 
have brought their moral ideals into full reality. 

It is philosophy that sets men’s goals and determines their course; it is 
only philosophy that can save them now. Today, the world is facing a 
choice: if civilization is to survive, it is the altruist morality that men have to 
reject. 

I will close with the words of John Galt, which I address, as he did, to all 
the moralists of altruism, past or present: 

“You have been using fear as your weapon and have been bringing death 
to man as his punishment for rejecting your morality. We offer him life as 
his reward for accepting ours.”

2. Mental Health versus Mysticism and 
Self-Sacrifice 

by Nathaniel Branden 


The standard of mental health — of biologically appropriate mental 
functioning — is the same as that of physical health: man’s survival and well- 
being. A mind is healthy to the extent that its method of functioning is such 
as to provide man with the control over reality that the support and fur- 
therance of his life require. 

The hallmark of this control is self-esteem. Self-esteem is the 
consequence, expression and reward of a mind fully committed to reason. 
Reason, the faculty that identifies and integrates the material provided by the 
senses, is man’s basic tool of survival. Commitment to reason is 
commitment to the maintenance of a full intellectual focus, to the constant 
expansion of one’s understanding and knowledge, to the principle that one’s 
actions must be consistent with one’s convictions, that one must never 
attempt to fake reality or place any consideration above reality, that one 
must never permit oneself contradictions — that one must never attempt to 
subvert or sabotage the proper function of consciousness. 

The proper function of consciousness is: perception, cognition, and the 
control of action. 

An unobstructed consciousness, an integrated consciousness, a thinking 
consciousness, is a healthy consciousness. A blocked consciousness, an 
evading consciousness, a consciousness tom by conflict and divided against 
itself, a consciousness disintegrated by fear or immobilized by depression, a 
consciousness dissociated from reality, is an unhealthy consciousness. (For a 
fuller discussion of this issue, see the chapter entitled “Objectivism and 
Psychology” in my book Who Is Ayn RancP. ) 

In order to deal with reality successfully — to pursue and achieve the 
values which his life requires — man needs self-esteem: he needs to be 
confident of his efficacy and worth. 

Anxiety and guilt, the antipodes of self-esteem and the insignia of mental 
illness, are the disintegrators of thought, the distorters of values and the 
paralyzers of action. 

When a man of self-esteem chooses his values and sets his goals, when he 
projects the long-range purposes that will unify and guide his actions — it is 
like a bridge thrown to the future, across which his life will pass, a bridge 


32 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


supported by the conviction that his mind is competent to think, to judge, to 
value, and that he is worthy of enjoying values. 

This sense of control over reality is not the result of special skills, ability 
or knowledge. It is not dependent on particular successes or failures. It 
reflects one’s fundamental relationship to reality, one’s conviction of 
fundamental efficacy and worthiness. It reflects the certainty that, in essence 
and in principle, one is right for reality. Self-esteem is a metaphysical 
estimate. 

It is this psychological state that traditional morality makes impossible, to 
the extent that a man accepts it. 

Neither mysticism nor the creed of self-sacrifice is compatible with 
mental health or self-esteem. These doctrines are destructive existentially 
and psychologically. 

(1) The maintenance of his life and the achievement of self-esteem 
require of man the fullest exercise of his reason — but morality, men are 
taught, rests on and requires faith. 

Faith is the commitment of one’s consciousness to beliefs for which one 
has no sensory evidence or rational proof. 

When a man rejects reason as his standard of judgment, only one 
alternative standard remains to him: his feelings. A mystic is a man who 
treats his feelings as tools of cognition. Faith is the equation of feeling with 
knowledge. 

To practice the “virtue” of faith, one must be willing to suspend one’s 
sight and one’s judgment; one must be willing to live with the unintelligible, 
with that which cannot be conceptualized or integrated into the rest of one’s 
knowledge, and to induce a trancelike illusion of understanding. One must 
be willing to repress one’s critical faculty and hold it as one’s guilt; one 
must be willing to drown any questions that rise in protest — to strangle any 
trust of reason convulsively seeking to assert its proper function as the pro- 
tector of one’s life and cognitive integrity. 

Remember that all of man’s knowledge and all his concepts have a 
hierarchical structure. The foundation and starting point of man’s thinking 
are his sensory perceptions; on this base, man forms his first concepts, then 
goes on building the edifice of his knowledge by identifying and integrating 
new concepts on a wider and wider scale. If man’s thinking is to be valid, 
this process must be guided by logic, “the art of noncontradictory 
identification” — and any new concept man forms must be integrated without 
contradiction into the hierarchical structure of his knowledge. To introduce 
into one ’s consciousness any idea that cannot be so integrated, an idea not 
derived from reality, not validated by a process of reason, not subject to 


33 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


rational examination or judgment — and worse : an idea that clashes with the 
rest of one’s concepts and understanding of reality — is to sabotage the 
integrative function of consciousness, to undercut the rest of one’s 
convictions and kill one’s capacity to be certain of anything. This is the 
meaning of John Galt’s statement in Atlas Shrugged that “the alleged 
shortcut to knowledge, which is faith, is only a short circuit destroying the 
mind.” 

There is no greater self-delusion than to imagine that one can render unto 
reason that which is reason’s and unto faith that which is faith’s. Faith 
cannot be circumscribed or delimited; to surrender one’s consciousness by 
an inch, is to surrender one’s consciousness in total. Either reason is an 
absolute to a mind or it is not — and if it is not, there is no place to draw the 
line, no principle by which to draw it, no barrier faith cannot cross, no part 
of one’s life faith cannot invade: one remains rational until and unless one’s 
feelings decree otherwise. 

Faith is a malignancy that no system can tolerate with impunity; and the 
man who succumbs to it, will call on it in precisely those issues where he 
needs his reason most. When one turns from reason to faith, when one 
rejects the absolutism of reality, one undercuts the absolutism of one’s 
consciousness — and one’s mind becomes an organ one can not trust any 
longer. It becomes what the mystics claim it to be: a tool of distortion. 

(2) Man’s need of self-esteem entails the need for a sense of control over 
reality — but no control is possible in a universe which, by one’s own 
concession, contains the supernatural, the miraculous and the causeless, a 
universe in which one is at the mercy of ghosts and demons, in which one 
must deal, not with the unknown, but with the unknowable', no control is 
possible if man proposes, but a ghost disposes; no control is possible if the 
universe is a haunted house. 

(3) His life and self-esteem require that the object and concern of man’s 
consciousness be reality and this earth — but morality, men are taught, 
consists of scorning this earth and the world available to sensory perception, 
and of contemplating, instead, a “different” and “higher” reality, a realm 
inaccessible to reason and incommunicable in language, but attainable by 
revelation, by special dialectical processes, by that superior state of 
intellectual lucidity known to Zen-Buddhists as “No-Mind,” or by death. 

There is only one reality — the reality knowable to reason. And if man 
does not choose to perceive it, there is nothing else for him to perceive; if it 
is not of this world that he is conscious, then he is not conscious at all. 

The sole result of the mystic projection of “another” reality, is that it 
incapacitates man psychologically for this one. It was not by contemplating 


34 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


the transcendental, the ineffable, the undefmable — it was not by 
contemplating the nonexistent — that man lifted himself from the cave and 
transformed the material world to make a human existence possible on earth. 

If it is a virtue to renounce one’s mind, but a sin to use it; if it is a virtue to 
approximate the mental state of a schizophrenic, but a sin to be in 
intellectual focus; if it is a virtue to denounce this earth, but a sin to make it 
livable; if it is a virtue to mortify the flesh, but a sin to work and act; if it is a 
virtue to despise life, but a sin to sustain and enjoy it — then no self-esteem 
or control or efficacy are possible to man, nothing is possible to him but the 
guilt and terror of a wretch caught in a nightmare universe, a universe 
created by some metaphysical sadist who has cast man into a maze where 
the door marked “virtue” leads to self-destruction and the door marked 
“efficacy” leads to self-damnation. 

(4) His life and self-esteem require that man take pride in his power to 
think, pride in his power to live — but morality, men are taught, holds pride, 
and specifically intellectual pride, as the gravest of sins. Virtue begins, men 
are taught, with humility: with the recognition of the helplessness, the 
smallness, the impotence of one’s mind. 

Is man omniscient? — demand the mystics. Is he infallible? Then how dare 
he challenge the word of God, or of God’s representatives, and set himself 
up as the judge of — anything? 

Intellectual pride is not — as the mystics preposterously imply it to be — a 
pretense at omniscience or infallibility. On the contrary, precisely because 
man must struggle for knowledge, precisely because the pursuit of 
knowledge requires an effort, the men who assume this responsibility 
properly feel pride. 

Sometimes, colloquially, pride is taken to mean a pretense at 
accomplishments one has not in fact achieved. But the braggart, the boaster, 
the man who affects virtues he does not possess, is not proud; he has merely 
chosen the most humiliating way to reveal his humility. 

Pride is one’s response to one’s power to achieve values, the pleasure one 
takes in one’s own efficacy. And it is this that mystics hold as evil. 

But if doubt, not confidence, is man’s proper moral state; if self-distrust, 
not self-reliance, is the proof of his virtue; if fear, not self-esteem, is the 
mark of perfection; if guilt, not pride, is his goal — then mental illness is a 
moral ideal, the neurotics and psychotics are the highest exponents of 
morality, and the thinkers, the achievers, are the sinners, those who are too 
corrupt and too arrogant to seek virtue and psychological well-being through 
the belief that they are unfit to exist. 


35 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


Humility is, of necessity, the basic virtue of a mystical morality; it is the 
only virtue possible to men who have renounced the mind. 

Pride has to be earned; it is the reward of effort and achievement; but to 
gain the virtue of humility, one has only to abstain from thinking — nothing 
else is demanded — and one will feel humble quickly enough. 

(5) His life and self-esteem require of man loyalty to his values, loyalty to 
his mind and its judgments, loyalty to his life — but the essence of morality, 
men are taught, consists of self-sacrifice: the sacrifice of one’s mind to some 
higher authority, and the sacrifice of one’s values to whoever may claim to 
require it. 

It is not necessary, in this context, to analyze the almost countless evils, 
entailed by the precept of self-sacrifice. Its irrationality and destructiveness 
have been thoroughly exposed in Atlas Shrugged. But there are two aspects 
of the issue that are especially pertinent to the subject of mental health. 

The first is the fact that ^//-sacrifice means — and can only mean — rnind- 
sacrifice. 

A sacrifice, it is necessary to remember, means the surrender of a higher 
value in favor of a lower value or of a nonvalue. If one gives up that which 
one does not value in order to obtain that which one does value — or if one 
gives up a lesser value in order to obtain a greater one — this is not a 
sacrifice, but a gain. 

Remember further that all of a man’s values exist in a hierarchy; he values 
some things more than others; and, to the extent that he is rational, the 
hierarchical order of his values is rational: that is, he values things in 
proportion to their importance in serving his life and well-being. That which 
is inimical to his life and well-being, that which is inimical to his nature and 
needs as a living being, he devalues. 

Conversely, one of the characteristics of mental illness is a distorted value 
structure; the neurotic does not value things according to their objective 
merit, in relation to his nature and needs; he frequently values the very 
things that will lead him to self-destruction. Judged by objective standards, 
he is engaged in a chronic process of self-sacrifice. 

But if sacrifice is a virtue, it is not the neurotic but the rational man who 
must be “cured.” He must leam to do violence to his own rational 
judgment — to reverse the order of his value hierarchy — to surrender that 
which his mind has chosen as the good — to turn against and invalidate his 
own consciousness.

Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


to sacrifice one’s judgment; to sacrifice one’s judgment is to sacrifice one’s 
mind — and it is nothing less than this that the creed of self-sacrifice aims at 
and demands. 

The root of selfishness is man’s right — and need — to act on his own 
judgment. If his judgment is to be an object of sacrifice — what sort of 
efficacy, control, freedom from conflict, or serenity of spirit will be possible 
to man? 

The second aspect that is pertinent here, involves not only the creed of 
self-sacrifice but all the foregoing tenets of traditional morality. 

An irrational morality, a morality set in opposition to man’s nature, to the 
facts of reality and to the requirements of man’s survival, necessarily forces 
men to accept the belief that there is an inevitable clash between the moral 
and the practical — that they must choose either to be virtuous or to be happy, 
to be idealistic or to be successful, but they cannot be both. This view 
establishes a disastrous conflict on the deepest level of man’s being, a lethal 
dichotomy that tears man apart: it forces him to choose between making 
himself able to live and making himself worthy of living. Yet self-esteem 
and mental health require that he achieve both. 

If man holds life on earth as the good, if he judges his values by the 
standard of that which is proper to the existence of a rational being, then 
there is no clash between the requirements of survival and of morality — no 
clash between making himself able to live and making himself worthy of 
living; he achieves the second by achieving the first. But there is a clash, if 
man holds the renunciation of this earth as the good, the renunciation of life, 
of mind, of happiness, of self. Under an anti-life morality, man makes 
himself worthy of living to the extent that he makes himself unable to live — 
and to the extent that he makes himself able to live, he makes himself 
unworthy of living. 

The answer given by many defenders of traditional morality is: “Oh, but 
people don’t have to go to extremes!” — meaning: “We don’t expect people 
to be fully moral. We expect them to smuggle some self-interest into their 
lives. We recognize that people have to live, after all.” 

The defense, then, of this code of morality is that few people will be 
suicidal enough to attempt to practice it consistently. Hypocrisy is to be 
man’s protector against his professed moral convictions. What does that do 
to his self-esteem? 

And what of the victims who are insufficiently hypocritical? 

What of the child who withdraws in terror into an autistic universe 
because he cannot cope with the ravings of parents who tell him that he is 
guilty by nature, that his body is evil, that thinking is sinful, that question- 


37 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


asking is blasphemous, that doubting is depravity, and that he must obey the 
orders of a supernatural ghost because, if he doesn’t, he will bum forever in 
hell? 

Or the daughter who collapses in guilt over the sin of not wanting to 
devote her life to caring for the ailing father who has given her cause to feel 
only hatred? 

Or the adolescent who flees into homosexuality because he has been 
taught that sex is evil and that women are to be worshiped, but not desired? 

Or the businessman who suffers an anxiety attack because, after years of 
being urged to be thrifty and industrious, he has finally committed the sin of 
succeeding, and is now told that it shall be easier for the camel to pass 
through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of 
heaven? 

Or the neurotic who, in hopeless despair, gives up the attempt to solve his 
problems because he has always heard it preached that this earth is a realm 
of misery, futility and doom, where no happiness or fulfillment is possible to 
man? 

If the advocates of these doctrines bear a grave moral responsibility, there 
is a group who, perhaps, bears a graver responsibility still: the psychologists 
and psychiatrists who see the human wreckage of these doctrines, but who 
remain silent and do not protest — who declare that philosophical and moral 
issues do not concern them, that science cannot pronounce value 
judgments — who shmg off their professional obligations with the assertion 
that a rational code of morality is impossible, and, by their silence, lend 
their sanction to spiritual murder.

3. The Ethics of Emergencies 

by Ayn Rand 


The psychological results of altruism may be observed in the fact that a great 
many people approach the subject of ethics by asking such questions as: 
“Should one risk one’s life to help a man who is: a) drowning, b) trapped in 
a fire, c) stepping in front of a speeding truck, d) hanging by his fingernails 
over an abyss?” 

Consider the implications of that approach. If a man accepts the ethics of 
altruism, he suffers the following consequences (in proportion to the degree 
of his acceptance): 

1 . Lack of self-esteem — since his first concern in the realm of values is 
not how to live his life, but how to sacrifice it. 

2. Lack of respect for others — since he regards mankind as a herd of 
doomed beggars crying for someone’s help. 

3. A nightmare view of existence — since he believes that men are 
trapped in a “malevolent universe” where disasters are the constant and 
primary concern of their lives. 

4. And, in fact, a lethargic indifference to ethics, a hopelessly cynical 
amorality — since his questions involve situations which he is not likely ever 
to encounter, which bear no relation to the actual problems of his own life 
and thus leave him to live without any moral principles whatever. 

By elevating the issue of helping others into the central and primary issue 
of ethics, altruism has destroyed the concept of any authentic benevolence or 
good will among men. It has indoctrinated men with the idea that to value 
another human being is an act of selflessness, thus implying that a man can 
have no personal interest in others — that to value another means to sacrifice 
oneself — that any love, respect or admiration a man may feel for others is 
not and cannot be a source of his own enjoyment, but is a threat to his 
existence, a sacrificial blank check signed over to his loved ones. 

The men who accept that dichotomy but choose its other side, the ultimate 
products of altruism’s dehumanizing influence, are those psychopaths who 
do not challenge altruism’s basic premise, but proclaim their rebellion 
against self-sacrifice by announcing that they are totally indifferent to 
anything living and would not lift a finger to help a man or a dog left 
mangled by a hit-and-run driver (who is usually one of their own kind). 

Most men do not accept or practice either side of altruism’s viciously 
false dichotomy, but its result is a total intellectual chaos on the issue of 


39 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


proper human relationships and on such questions as the nature, purpose or 
extent of the help one may give to others. Today, a great many well- 
meaning, reasonable men do not know how to identify or conceptualize the 
moral principles that motivate their love, affection or good will, and can find 
no guidance in the field of ethics, which is dominated by the stale platitudes 
of altruism. 

On the question of why man is not a sacrificial animal and why help to 
others is not his moral duty, I refer you to Atlas Shrugged. This present 
discussion is concerned with the principles by which one identifies and 
evaluates the instances involving a man’s nonsacrificial help to others. 

“Sacrifice” is the surrender of a greater value for the sake of a lesser one 
or of a nonvalue. Thus, altruism gauges a man’s virtue by the degree to 
which he surrenders, renounces or betrays his values (since help to a stranger 
or an enemy is regarded as more virtuous, less “selfish,” than help to those 
one loves). The rational principle of conduct is the exact opposite: always 
act in accordance with the hierarchy of your values, and never sacrifice a 
greater value to a lesser one. 

This applies to all choices, including one’s actions toward other men. It 
requires that one possess a defined hierarchy of rational values (values 
chosen and validated by a rational standard). Without such a hierarchy, 
neither rational conduct nor considered value judgments nor moral choices 
are possible. 

Love and friendship are profoundly personal, selfish values: love is an 
expression and assertion of self-esteem, a response to one’s own values in 
the person of another. One gains a profoundly personal, selfish joy from the 
mere existence of the person one loves. It is one’s own personal, selfish 
happiness that one seeks, earns and derives from love. 

A “selfless,” “disinterested” love is a contradiction in terms: it means that 
one is indifferent to that which one values. 

Concern for the welfare of those one loves is a rational part of one’s 
selfish interests. If a man who is passionately in love with his wife spends a 
fortune to cure her of a dangerous illness, it would be absurd to claim that he 
does it as a “sacrifice” for her sake, not his own, and that it makes no 
difference to him, personally and selfishly, whether she lives or dies. 

Any action that a man undertakes for the benefit of those he loves is not a 
sacrifice if, in the hierarchy of his values, in the total context of the choices 
open to him, it achieves that which is of greatest personal (and rational) 
importance to him. In the above example, his wife’s survival is of greater 
value to the husband than anything else that his money could buy, it is of 


40 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


greatest importance to his own happiness and, therefore, his action is not a 
sacrifice. 

But suppose he let her die in order to spend his money on saving the lives 
of ten other women, none of whom meant anything to him — as the ethics of 
altruism would require. That would be a sacrifice. Here the difference be- 
tween Objectivism and altruism can be seen most clearly: if sacrifice is the 
moral principle of action, then that husband should sacrifice his wife for the 
sake of ten other women. What distinguishes the wife from the ten others? 
Nothing but her value to the husband who has to make the choice — nothing 
but the fact that his happiness requires her survival. 

The Objectivist ethics would tell him: your highest moral purpose is the 
achievement of your own happiness, your money is yours, use it to save your 
wife, that is your moral right and your rational, moral choice. 

Consider the soul of the altruistic moralist who would be prepared to tell 
that husband the opposite. (And then ask yourself whether altruism is 
motivated by benevolence.) 

The proper method of judging when or whether one should help another 
person is by reference to one’s own rational self-interest and one’s own 
hierarchy of values: the time, money or effort one gives or the risk one takes 
should be proportionate to the value of the person in relation to one’s own 
happiness. 

To illustrate this on the altruists’ favorite example: the issue of saving a 
drowning person. If the person to be saved is a stranger, it is morally proper 
to save him only when the danger to one’s own life is minimal; when the 
danger is great, it would be immoral to attempt it: only a lack of self-esteem 
could permit one to value one’s life no higher than that of any random 
stranger. (And, conversely, if one is drowning, one cannot expect a stranger 
to risk his life for one’s sake, remembering that one’s life cannot be as valu- 
able to him as his own.) 

If the person to be saved is not a stranger, then the risk one should be 
willing to take is greater in proportion to the greatness of that person’s value 
to oneself. If it is the man or woman one loves, then one can be willing to 
give one’s own life to save him or her — for the selfish reason that life 
without the loved person could be unbearable. 

Conversely, if a man is able to swim and to save his drowning wife, but 
becomes panicky, gives in to an unjustified, irrational fear and lets her 
drown, then spends his life in loneliness and misery — one would not call 
him “selfish”; one would condemn him morally for his treason to himself 
and to his own values, that is: his failure to fight for the preservation of a 
value crucial to his own happiness. Remember that values are that which one 


41 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


acts to gain and/or keep, and that one’s own happiness has to be achieved by 
one’s own effort. Since one’s own happiness is the moral purpose of one’s 
life, the man who fails to achieve it because of his own default, because of 
his failure to fight for it, is morally guilty. 

The virtue involved in helping those one loves is not “selflessness” or 
“sacrifice,” but integrity. Integrity is loyalty to one’s convictions and values; 
it is the policy of acting in accordance with one’s values, of expressing, 
upholding and translating them into practical reality. If a man professes to 
love a woman, yet his actions are indifferent, inimical or damaging to her, it 
is his lack of integrity that makes him immoral. 

The same principle applies to relationships among friends. If one’s friend 
is in trouble, one should act to help him by whatever nonsacrificial means 
are appropriate. For instance, if one’s friend is starving, it is not a sacrifice, 
but an act of integrity to give him money for food rather than buy some 
insignificant gadget for oneself, because his welfare is important in the scale 
of one’s personal values. If the gadget means more than the friend’s 
suffering, one had no business pretending to be his friend. 

The practical implementation of friendship, affection and love consists of 
incorporating the welfare (the rational welfare) of the person involved into 
one’s own hierarchy of values, then acting accordingly. 

But this is a reward which men have to earn by means of their virtues and 
which one cannot grant to mere acquaintances or strangers. 

What, then, should one properly grant to strangers? The generalized 
respect and good will which one should grant to a human being in the name 
of the potential value he represents — until and unless he forfeits it. 

A rational man does not forget that life is the source of all values and, as 
such, a common bond among living beings (as against inanimate matter), 
that other men are potentially able to achieve the same virtues as his own 
and thus be of enormous value to him. This does not mean that he regards 
human lives as interchangeable with his own. He recognizes the fact that his 
own life is the source , not only of all his values, but of his capacity to value. 
Therefore, the value he grants to others is only a consequence, an extension, 
a secondary projection of the primary value which is himself. 

“The respect and good will that men of self-esteem feel toward other 
human beings is profoundly egoistic; they feel, in effect: ‘Other men are of 
value because they are of the same species as myself.’ In revering living 
entities, they are revering their own life. This is the psychological base of 
any emotion of sympathy and any feeling of ‘species solidarity.’ ” 4 


4 Nathaniel Branden, “Benevolence versus Altruism,” The Objectivist Newsletter, July 1962. 


42 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


Since men are bom tabula rasa, both cognitively and morally, a rational 
man regards strangers as innocent until proved guilty, and grants them that 
initial good will in the name of their human potential. After that, he judges 
them according to the moral character they have actualized. If he finds them 
guilty of major evils, his good will is replaced by contempt and moral 
condemnation. (If one values human life, one cannot value its destroyers.) If 
he finds them to be virtuous, he grants them personal, individual value and 
appreciation, in proportion to their virtues. 

It is on the ground of that generalized good will and respect for the value 
of human life that one helps strangers in an emergency — and only in an 
emergency. 

It is important to differentiate between the mles of conduct in an 
emergency situation and the mles of conduct in the normal conditions of 
human existence. This does not mean a double standard of morality: the 
standard and the basic principles remain the same, but their application to 
either case requires precise definitions. 

An emergency is an unchosen, unexpected event, limited in time, that 
creates conditions under which human survival is impossible — such as a 
flood, an earthquake, a fire, a shipwreck. In an emergency situation, men’s 
primary goal is to combat the disaster, escape the danger and restore normal 
conditions (to reach dry land, to put out the fire, etc.). 

By “normal” conditions I mean metaphysically normal, normal in the 
nature of things, and appropriate to human existence. Men can live on land, 
but not in water or in a raging fire. Since men are not omnipotent, it is 
metaphysically possible for unforeseeable disasters to strike them, in which 
case their only task is to return to those conditions under which their lives 
can continue. By its nature, an emergency situation is temporary; if it were 
to last, men would perish. 

It is only in emergency situations that one should volunteer to help 
strangers, if it is in one’s power. For instance, a man who values human life 
and is caught in a shipwreck, should help to save his fellow passengers 
(though not at the expense of his own life). But this does not mean that after 
they all reach shore, he should devote his efforts to saving his fellow 
passengers from poverty, ignorance, neurosis or whatever other troubles they 
might have. Nor does it mean that he should spend his life sailing the seven 
seas in search of shipwreck victims to save. 

Or to take an example that can occur in everyday life: suppose one hears 
that the man next door is ill and penniless. Illness and poverty are not 
metaphysical emergencies, they are part of the normal risks of existence; but 
since the man is temporarily helpless, one may bring him food and medicine, 


43 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


if one can afford it (as an act of good will, not of duty) or one may raise a 
fund among the neighbors to help him out. But this does not mean that one 
must support him from then on, nor that one must spend one’s life looking 
for starving men to help. 

In the normal conditions of existence, man has to choose his goals, project 
them in time, pursue them and achieve them by his own effort. He cannot do 
it if his goals are at the mercy of and must be sacrificed to any misfortune 
happening to others. He cannot live his life by the guidance of rules 
applicable only to conditions under which human survival is impossible. 

The principle that one should help men in an emergency cannot be 
extended to regard all human suffering as an emergency and to turn the 
misfortune of some into a first mortgage on the lives of others. 

Poverty, ignorance, illness and other problems of that kind are not 
metaphysical emergencies. By the metaphysical nature of man and of 
existence, man has to maintain his life by his own effort; the values he 
needs — such as wealth or knowledge — are not given to him automatically, 
as a gift of nature, but have to be discovered and achieved by his own 
thinking and work. One’s sole obligation toward others, in this respect, is to 
maintain a social system that leaves men free to achieve, to gain and to keep 
their values. 

Every code of ethics is based on and derived from a metaphysics, that is: 
from a theory about the fundamental nature of the universe in which man 
lives and acts. The altruist ethics is based on a “malevolent universe” 
metaphysics, on the theory that man, by his very nature, is helpless and 
doomed — that success, happiness, achievement are impossible to him — that 
emergencies, disasters, catastrophes are the norm of his life and that his 
primary goal is to combat them. 

As the simplest empirical refutation of that metaphysics — as evidence of 
the fact that the material universe is not inimical to man and that 
catastrophes are the exception, not the rule of his existence — observe the 
fortunes made by insurance companies. 

Observe also that the advocates of altruism are unable to base their ethics 
on any facts of men’s normal existence and that they always offer “lifeboat” 
situations as examples from which to derive the rules of moral conduct. 
(“What should you do if you and another man are in a lifeboat that can carry 
only one?” etc.) 

The fact is that men do not live in lifeboats — and that a lifeboat is not the 
place on which to base one’s metaphysics. 

The moral purpose of a man’s life is the achievement of his own 
happiness. This does not mean that he is indifferent to all men, that human

life is of no value to him and that he has no reason to help others in an 
emergency. But it does mean that he does not subordinate his life to the 
welfare of others, that he does not sacrifice himself to their needs, that the 
relief of their suffering is not his primary concern, that any help he gives is 
an exception, not a rule, an act of generosity, not of moral duty, that it is 
marginal and incidental — as disasters are marginal and incidental in the 
course of human existence — and that values, not disasters, are the goal, the 
first concern and the motive power of his life.

4. The “Conflicts” of Men’s interests 

by Ayn Rand 


Some students of Objectivism find it difficult to grasp the Objectivist 
principle that “there are no conflicts of interests among rational men.” 

A typical question runs as follows: “Suppose two men apply for the same 
job. Only one of them can be hired. Isn’t this an instance of a conflict of 
interests, and isn’t the benefit of one man achieved at the price of the 
sacrifice of the other?” 

There are four interrelated considerations which are involved in a rational 
man’s view of his interests, but which are ignored or evaded in the above 
question and in all similar approaches to the issue. I shall designate these 
four as: (a) “Reality,” (b) “Context,” (c) “Responsibility,” (d) “Effort.” 

(a) Reality. The term “interests” is a wide abstraction that covers the 
entire field of ethics. It includes the issues of: man’s values, his desires, his 
goals and their actual achievement in reality. A man’s “interests” depend on 
the kind of goals he chooses to pursue, his choice of goals depends on his 
desires, his desires depend on his values — and, for a rational man, his values 
depend on the judgment of his mind. 

Desires (or feelings or emotions or wishes or whims) are not tools of 
cognition; they are not a valid standard of value, nor a valid criterion of 
man’s interests. The mere fact that a man desires something does not 
constitute a proof that the object of his desire is good , nor that its 
achievement is actually to his interest. 

To claim that a man’s interests are sacrificed whenever a desire of his is 
frustrated — is to hold a subjectivist view of man’s values and interests. 
Which means: to believe that it is proper, moral and possible for man to 
achieve his goals, regardless of whether they contradict the facts of reality or 
not. Which means: to hold an irrational or mystical view of existence. Which 
means: to deserve no further consideration. 

In choosing his goals (the specific values he seeks to gain and/or keep), a 
rational man is guided by his thinking (by a process of reason) — not by his 
feelings or desires. He does not regard desires as irreducible primaries, as 
the given, which he is destined irresistibly to pursue. He does not regard 
“because I want it” or “because I feel like it” as a sufficient cause and 
validation of his actions. He chooses and/or identifies his desires by a 
process of reason, and he does not act to achieve a desire until and unless he 
is able rationally to validate it in the full context of his knowledge and of his 


46 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


other values and goals. He does not act until he is able to say: “I want it 
because it is right.” 

The Law of Identity (A is A) is a rational man’s paramount consideration 
in the process of determining his interests. He knows that the contradictory 
is the impossible, that a contradiction cannot be achieved in reality and that 
the attempt to achieve it can lead only to disaster and destruction. Therefore, 
he does not permit himself to hold contradictory values, to pursue 
contradictory goals, or to imagine that the pursuit of a contradiction can ever 
be to his interest. 

Only an irrationalist (or mystic or subjectivist — in which category I place 
all those who regard faith, feelings or desires as man’s standard of value) 
exists in a perpetual conflict of “interests.” Not only do his alleged interests 
clash with those of other men, but they clash also with one another. 

No one finds it difficult to dismiss from philosophical consideration the 
problem of a man who wails that life entraps him in an irreconcilable 
conflict because he cannot eat his cake and have it, too. That problem does 
not acquire intellectual validity by being expanded to involve more than 
cake — whether one expands it to the whole universe, as in the doctrines of 
Existentialism, or only to a few random whims and evasions, as in most 
people’s views of their interests. 

When a person reaches the stage of claiming that man ’s interests conflict 
with reality, the concept “interests” ceases to be meaningful — and his 
problem ceases to be philosophical and becomes psychological. 

(b) Context. Just as a rational man does not hold any conviction out of 
context — that is: without relating it to the rest of his knowledge and 
resolving any possible contradictions — so he does not hold or pursue any 
desire out of context. And he does not judge what is or is not to his interest 
out of context, on the range of any given moment. 

Context-dropping is one of the chief psychological tools of evasion. In 
regard to one’s desires, there are two major ways of context-dropping: the 
issues of range and of means. 

A rational man sees his interests in terms of a lifetime and selects his 
goals accordingly. This does not mean that he has to be omniscient, 
infallible or clairvoyant. It means that he does not live his life short-range 
and does not drift like a bum pushed by the spur of the moment. It means 
that he does not regard any moment as cut off from the context of the rest of 
his life, and that he allows no conflicts or contradictions between his short- 
range and long-range interests. He does not become his own destroyer by 
pursuing a desire today which wipes out all his values tomorrow. 


47 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


A rational man does not indulge in wistful longings for ends divorced 
from means. He does not hold a desire without knowing (or learning) and 
considering the means by which it is to be achieved. Since he knows that 
nature does not provide man with the automatic satisfaction of his desires, 
that a man’s goals or values have to be achieved by his own effort, that the 
lives and efforts of other men are not his property and are not there to serve 
his wishes — a rational man never holds a desire or pursues a goal which 
cannot be achieved directly or indirectly by his own effort. 

It is with a proper understanding of this “ indirectly ” that the crucial social 
issue begins. 

Living in a society, instead of on a desert island, does not relieve a man of 
the responsibility of supporting his own life. The only difference is that he 
supports his life by trading his products or services for the products or 
services of others. And, in this process of trade, a rational man does not seek 
or desire any more or any less than his own effort can earn. What determines 
his earnings? The free market, that is: the voluntary choice and judgment of 
the men who are willing to trade him their effort in return. 

When a man trades with others, he is counting — explicitly or implicitly — 
on their rationality, that is: on their ability to recognize the objective value of 
his work. (A trade based on any other premise is a con game or a fraud.) 
Thus, when a rational man pursues a goal in a free society, he does not place 
himself at the mercy of whims, the favors or the prejudices of others; he 
depends on nothing but his own effort: directly, by doing objectively 
valuable work — indirectly, through the objective evaluation of his work by 
others. 

It is in this sense that a rational man never holds a desire or pursues a goal 
which cannot be achieved by his own effort. He trades value for value. He 
never seeks or desires the unearned. If he undertakes to achieve a goal that 
requires the cooperation of many people, he never counts on anything but his 
own ability to persuade them and their voluntary agreement. 

Needless to say, a rational man never distorts or corrupts his own 
standards and judgment in order to appeal to the irrationality, stupidity or 
dishonesty of others. He knows that such a course is suicidal. He knows that 
one’s only practical chance to achieve any degree of success or anything 
humanly desirable lies in dealing with those who are rational, whether there 
are many of them or few. If, in any given set of circumstances, any victory is 
possible at all, it is only reason that can win it. And, in a free society, no 
matter how hard the struggle might be, it is reason that ultimately wins. 

Since he never drops the context of the issues he deals with, a rational 
man accepts that struggle as to his interest — because he knows that freedom 


48 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


is to his interest. He knows that the struggle to achieve his values includes 
the possibility of defeat. He knows also that there is no alternative and no 
automatic guarantee of success for man’s effort, neither in dealing with 
nature nor with other men. So he does not judge his interests by any 
particular defeat nor by the range of any particular moment. He lives and 
judges long-range. And he assumes the full responsibility of knowing what 
conditions are necessary for the achievement of his goals. 

(c) Responsibility. This last is the particular form of intellectual 
responsibility that most people evade. That evasion is the major cause of 
their frustrations and defeats. 

Most people hold their desires without any context whatever, as ends 
hanging in a foggy vacuum, the fog hiding any concept of means. They 
rouse themselves mentally only long enough to utter an “/ wish,” and stop 
there, and wait, as if the rest were up to some unknown power. 

What they evade is the responsibility of judging the social world. They 
take the world as the given. “A world I never made” is the deepest essence 
of their attitude — and they seek only to adjust themselves uncritically to the 
incomprehensible requirements of those unknowable others who did make 
the world, whoever those might be. 

But humility and presumptuousness are two sides of the same 
psychological medal. In the willingness to throw oneself blindly on the 
mercy of others there is the implicit privilege of making blind demands on 
one’s masters. 

There are countless ways in which this sort of “metaphysical humility” 
reveals itself. For instance, there is the man who wishes to be rich, but never 
thinks of discovering what means, actions and conditions are required to 
achieve wealth. Who is he to judge? He never made the world — and 
“nobody gave him a break.” 

There is the girl who wishes to be loved, but never thinks of discovering 
what love is, what values it requires, and whether she possesses any virtues 
to be loved for. Who is she to judge? Love, she feels, is an inexplicable 
favor — so she merely longs for it, feeling that somebody has deprived her of 
her share in the distribution of favors. 

There are the parents who suffer deeply and genuinely, because their son 
(or daughter) does not love them, and who, simultaneously, ignore, oppose 
or attempt to destroy everything they know of their son’s convictions, values 
and goals, never thinking of the connection between these two facts, never 
making an attempt to understand their son. The world they never made and 
dare not challenge, has told them that children love parents automatically.

There is the man who wants a job, but never thinks of discovering what 
qualifications the job requires or what constitutes doing one’s work well. 
Who is he to judge? He never made the world. Somebody owes him a living. 
How? Somehow. 

A European architect of my acquaintance was talking, one day, of his trip 
to Puerto Rico. He described — with great indignation at the universe at 
large — the squalor of the Puerto Ricans’ living conditions. Then he 
described what wonders modern housing could do for them, which he had 
daydreamed in detail, including electric refrigerators and tiled bathrooms. I 
asked: “Who would pay for it?” He answered, in a faintly offended, almost 
huffy tone of voice: “Oh, that’s not for me to worry about! An architect’s 
task is only to project what should be done. Let somebody else think about 
the money.” 

That is the psychology from which all “social reforms” or “welfare states” 
or “noble experiments” or the destruction of the world have come. 

In dropping the responsibility for one’s own interests and life, one drops 
the responsibility of ever having to consider the interests and lives of 
others — of those others who are, somehow, to provide the satisfaction of 
one’s desires. 

Whoever allows a “somehow” into his view of the means by which his 
desires are to be achieved, is guilty of that “metaphysical humility” which, 
psychologically, is the premise of a parasite. As Nathaniel Branden pointed 
out in a lecture, “ somehow ” always means “somebody .” 

(d) Effort. Since a rational man knows that man must achieve his goals by 
his own effort, he knows that neither wealth nor jobs nor any human values 
exist in a given, limited, static quantity, waiting to be divided. He knows that 
all benefits have to be produced, that the gain of one man does not represent 
the loss of another, that a man’s achievement is not earned at the expense of 
those who have not achieved it. 

Therefore, he never imagines that he has any sort of unearned, unilateral 
claim on any human being — and he never leaves his interests at the mercy of 
any one person or single, specific concrete. He may need clients, but not any 
one particular customer — he may need a job, but not any one particular job. 

If he encounters competition, he either meets it or chooses another line of 
work. There is no job so slow that a better, more skillful performance of it 
would pass unnoticed and unappreciated; not in a free society. Ask any of- 
fice manager. 

It is only the passive, parasitical representatives of the “humility 
metaphysics” school who regard any competitor as a threat, because the 
thought of earning one’s position by personal merit is not part of their view 


50 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


of life. They regard themselves as interchangeable mediocrities who have 
nothing to offer and who fight, in a “static” universe, for someone’s 
causeless favor. 

A rational man knows that one does not live by means of “luck,” “breaks” 
or favors, that there is no such thing as an “only chance” or a single 
opportunity, and that this is guaranteed precisely by the existence of 
competition. He does not regard any concrete, specific goal or value as irre- 
placeable. He knows that only persons are irreplaceable — only those one 
loves. 

He knows also that there are no conflicts of interests among rational men 
even in the issue of love. Like any other value, love is not a static quantity to 
be divided, but an unlimited response to be earned. The love for one friend is 
not a threat to the love for another, and neither is the love for the various 
members of one’s family, assuming they have earned it. The most exclusive 
form — romantic love — is not an issue of competition. If two men are in love 
with the same woman, what she feels for either of them is not determined by 
what she feels for the other and is not taken away from him. If she chooses 
one of them, the “loser” could not have had what the “winner” has earned. 

It is only among the irrational, emotion-motivated persons, whose love is 
divorced from any standards of value, that chance rivalries, accidental 
conflicts and blind choices prevail. But then, whoever wins does not win 
much. Among the emotion-driven, neither love nor any other emotion has 
any meaning. 

Such, in brief essence, are the four major considerations involved in a 
rational man’s view of his interests. 

Now let us return to the question originally asked — about the two men 
applying for the same job — and observe in what manner it ignores or 
opposes these four considerations. 

(a) Reality. The mere fact that two men desire the same job does not 
constitute proof that either of them is entitled to it or deserves it, and that his 
interests are damaged if he does not obtain it. 

(b) Context. Both men should know that if they desire a job, their goal is 
made possible only by the existence of a business concern able to provide 
employment — that that business concern requires the availability of more 
than one applicant for any job — that if only one applicant existed, he would 
not obtain the job, because the business concern would have to close its 
doors — and that their competition for the job is to their interest, even though 
one of them will lose in that particular encounter. 

(c) Responsibility. Neither man has the moral right to declare that he 
doesn’t want to consider all those things, he just wants a job. He is not 


51 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


entitled to any desire or to any “interest” without knowledge of what is 
required to make its fulfillment possible. 

(d) Effort. Whoever gets the job, has earned it (assuming that the 
employer’s choice is rational). This benefit is due to his own merit — not to 
the “sacrifice” of the other man who never had any vested right to that job. 
The failure to give to a man what had never belonged to him can hardly be 
described as “sacrificing his interests.” 

All of the above discussion applies only to the relationships among 
rational men and only to a free society. In a free society, one does not have 
to deal with those who are irrational. One is free to avoid them. 

In a nonfree society, no pursuit of any interests is possible to anyone; 
nothing is possible but gradual and general destruction.

5. Isn’t Everyone Selfish? 

by Nathaniel Branden 


Some variety of this question is often raised as an objection to those who 
advocate an ethics of rational self-interest. For example, it is sometimes 
claimed: “Everyone does what he really wants to do — otherwise, he 
wouldn’t do it.” Or: “No one ever really sacrifices himself. Since every 
purposeful action is motivated by some value or goal that the actor desires, 
one always acts selfishly, whether one knows it or not.” 

To untangle the intellectual confusion involved in this viewpoint, let us 
consider what facts of reality give rise to such an issue as selfishness versus 
self-sacrifice, or egoism versus altruism, and what the concept of 
“selfishness” means and entails. 

The issue of selfishness versus self-sacrifice arises in an ethical context. 
Ethics is a code of values to guide man’s choices and actions — the choices 
and actions that determine the purpose and course of his life. In choosing his 
actions and goals, man faces constant alternatives. In order to choose, he 
requires a standard of value — a purpose which his actions are to serve or at 
which they are to aim. “ ‘Value’ presupposes an answer to the question: of 
value to whom and for what?” (Atlas Shrugged .) What is to be the goal or 
purpose of a man’s actions? Who is to be the intended beneficiary of his 
actions? Is he to hold, as his primary moral purpose, the achievement of his 
own life and happiness — or should his primary moral purpose be to serve the 
wishes and needs of others ? 

The clash between egoism and altruism lies in their conflicting answers to 
these questions. Egoism holds that man is an end in himself; altruism holds 
that man is a means to the ends of others. Egoism holds that, morally, the 
beneficiary of an action should be the person who acts; altruism holds that, 
morally, the beneficiary of an action should be someone other than the 
person who acts. 

To be selfish is to be motivated by concern for one’s self-interest. This 
requires that one consider what constitutes one’s self-interest and how to 
achieve it — what values and goals to pursue, what principles and policies to 
adopt. If a man were not concerned with this question, he could not be said 
objectively to be concerned with or to desire his self-interest; one cannot be 
concerned with or desire that of which one has no knowledge. 


53 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


Selfishness entails: (a) a hierarchy of values set by the standard of one’s 
self-interest, and (b) the refusal to sacrifice a higher value to a lower one or 
to a nonvalue. 

A genuinely selfish man knows that only reason can determine what is, in 
fact, to his self-interest, that to pursue contradictions or attempt to act in 
defiance of the facts of reality is self-destructive — and self-destruction is not 
to his self-interest. “To think, is to man’s self-interest; to suspend his 
consciousness, is not. To choose his goals in the full context of his 
knowledge, his values and his life, is to man’s self-interest; to act on the 
impulse of the moment, without regard for his long-range context, is not. To 
exist as a productive being, is to man’s self-interest; to attempt to exist as a 
parasite, is not. To seek the life proper to his nature, is to man’s self-interest; 
to seek to live as an animal, is not.” 5 

Because a genuinely selfish man chooses his goals by the guidance of 
reason — and because the interests of rational men do not clash — other men 
may often benefit from his actions. But the benefit of other men is not his 
primary purpose or goal; his own benefit is his primary purpose and the 
conscious goal directing his actions. 

To make this principle fully clear, let us consider an extreme example of 
an action which, in fact, is selfish, but which conventionally might be called 
self-sacrificial: a man’s willingness to die to save the life of the woman he 
loves. In what way would such a man be the beneficiary of his action? 

The answer is given in Atlas Shrugged — in the scene when Galt, knowing 
he is about to be arrested, tells Dagny: “If they get the slightest suspicion of 
what we are to each other, they will have you on a torture rack — I mean, 
physical torture — before my eyes, in less than a week. I am not going to wait 
for that. At the first mention of a threat to you, I will kill myself and stop 
them right there. ... 1 don’t have to tell you that if I do it, it won’t be an act of 
self-sacrifice. 1 do not care to live on their terms. I do not care to obey them 
and I do not care to see you enduring a drawn-out murder. There will be no 
values for me to seek after that — and I do not care to exist without values.” 
If a man loves a woman so much that he does not wish to survive her death, 
if life can have nothing more to offer him at that price, then his dying to save 
her is not a sacrifice. 

The same principle applies to a man, caught in a dictatorship, who 
willingly risks death to achieve freedom. To call his act a “self-sacrifice,” 
one would have to assume that he preferred to live as a slave. The 
selfishness of a man who is willing to die, if necessary, fighting for his

54 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


freedom, lies in the fact that he is unwilling to go on living in a world where 
he is no longer able to act on his own judgment — that is, a world where 
human conditions of existence are no longer possible to him. 

The selfishness or unselfishness of an action is to be determined 
objectively: it is not determined by the feelings of the person who acts. Just 
as feelings are not a tool of cognition, so they are not a criterion in ethics. 

Obviously, in order to act, one has to be moved by some personal motive; 
one has to “want,” in some sense, to perform the action. The issue of an 
action’s selfishness or unselfishness depends, not on whether or not one 
wants to perform it, but on why one wants to perform it. By what standard 
was the action chosen? To achieve what goal? 

If a man proclaimed that he felt he would best benefit others by robbing 
and murdering them, men would not be willing to grant that his actions were 
altruistic. By the same logic and for the same reasons, if a man pursues a 
course of blind self-destruction, his feeling that he has something to gain by 
it does not establish his actions as selfish. 

If, motivated solely by a sense of charity, compassion, duty or altruism, a 
person renounces a value, desire or goal in favor of the pleasure, wishes or 
needs of another person whom he values less than the thing he renounced — 
that is an act of self-sacrifice. The fact that a person may feel that he 
“wants” to do it, does not make his action selfish or establish objectively that 
he is its beneficiary. 

Suppose, for example, that a son chooses the career he wants by rational 
standards, but then renounces it in order to please his mother who prefers 
that he pursue a different career, one that will have more prestige in the eyes 
of the neighbors. The boy accedes to his mother’s wish because he has 
accepted that such is his moral duty: he believes that his duty as a son 
consists of placing his mother’s happiness above his own, even if he knows 
that his mother’s demand is irrational and even if he knows that he is 
sentencing himself to a life of misery and frustration. It is absurd for the 
advocates of the “everyone is selfish” doctrine to assert that since the boy is 
motivated by the desire to be “virtuous” or to avoid guilt, no self-sacrifice is 
involved and his action is really selfish. What is evaded is the question of 
why the boy feels and desires as he does. Emotions and desires are not 
causeless, irreducible primaries: they are the product of the premises one has 
accepted. The boy “wants” to renounce his career only because he has 
accepted the ethics of altruism; he believes that it is immoral to act for his 
self-interest. That is the principle directing his actions. 

Advocates of the “everyone is selfish” doctrine do not deny that, under 
the pressure of the altruist ethics, men can knowingly act against their own 


55 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


long-range happiness. They merely assert that in some higher, undefmable 
sense such men are still acting “selfishly.” A definition of “selfishness” that 
includes or permits the possibility of knowingly acting against one’s long- 
range happiness, is a contradiction in terms. 

It is only the legacy of mysticism that permits men to imagine that they 
are still speaking meaningfully when they declare that one can seek one’s 
happiness in the renunciation of one’s happiness. 

The basic fallacy in the “everyone is selfish” argument consists of an 
extraordinarily crude equivocation. It is a psychological truism — a 
tautology — that all purposeful behavior is motivated. But to equate 
“ motivated behavior” with “ selfish behavior” is to blank out the distinction 
between an elementary fact of human psychology and the phenomenon of 
ethical choice. It is to evade the central problem of ethics, namely: by what 
is man to be motivated? 

A genuine selfishness — that is: a genuine concern with discovering what 
is to one’s self-interest, an acceptance of the responsibility of achieving it, a 
refusal ever to betray it by acting on the blind whim, mood, impulse or 
feeling of the moment, an uncompromising loyalty to one’s judgment, 
convictions and values — represents a profound moral achievement. Those 
who assert that “everyone is selfish” commonly intend their statement as an 
expression of cynicism and contempt. But the truth is that their statement 
pays mankind a compliment it does not deserve.

6. The Psychology of Pleasure 

by Nathaniel Branden 


Pleasure, for man, is not a luxury, but a profound psychological need. 

Pleasure (in the widest sense of the term) is a metaphysical concomitant 
of life, the reward and consequence of successful action — just as pain is the 
insignia of failure, destruction, death. 

Through the state of enjoyment, man experiences the value of life, the 
sense that life is worth living, worth struggling to maintain. In order to live, 
man must act to achieve values. Pleasure or enjoyment is at once an 
emotional payment for successful action and an incentive to continue acting. 

Further, because of the metaphysical meaning of pleasure to man, the 
state of enjoyment gives him a direct experience of his own efficacy, of his 
competence to deal with the facts of reality, to achieve his values, to live. 
Implicitly contained in the experience of pleasure is the feeling: “I am in 
control of my existence” — just as implicitly contained in the experience of 
pain is the feeling: “I am helpless.” As pleasure emotionally entails a sense 
of efficacy, so pain emotionally entails a sense of impotence. 

Thus, in letting man experience, in his own person, the sense that life is a 
value and that he is a value, pleasure serves as the emotional fuel of man’s 
existence. 

Just as the pleasure-pain mechanism of man’s body works as a barometer 
of health or injury, so the pleasure-pain mechanism of his consciousness 
works on the same principle, acting as a barometer of what is for him or 
against him, what is beneficial to his life or inimical. But man is a being of 
volitional consciousness, he has no innate ideas, no automatic or infallible 
knowledge of what his survival depends on. He must choose the values that 
are to guide his actions and set his goals. His emotional mechanism will 
work according to the kind of values he chooses. It is his values that 
determine what a man feels to be for him or against him; it is his values that 
determine what a man seeks for pleasure. 

If a man makes an error in his choice of values, his emotional mechanism 
will not correct him: it has no will of its own. If a man’s values are such that 
he desires things which, in fact and in reality, lead to his destruction, his 
emotional mechanism will not save him, but will, instead, urge him on 
toward destruction: he will have set it in reverse, against himself and against 
the facts of reality, against his own life. Man’s emotional mechanism is like 
an electronic computer: man has the power to program it, but no power to 


57 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


change its nature — so that if he sets the wrong programming, he will not be 
able to escape the fact that the most self-destructive desires will have, for 
him, the emotional intensity and urgency of lifesaving actions. He has, of 
course, the power to change the programming — but only by changing his 
values. 

A man’s basic values reflect his conscious or subconscious view of 
himself and of existence. They are the expression of (a) the degree and 
nature of his self-esteem or lack of it, and (b) the extent to which he regards 
the universe as open to his understanding and action or closed — i.e., the 
extent to which he holds a benevolent or malevolent view of existence. 
Thus, the things which a man seeks for pleasure or enjoyment are 
profoundly revealing psychologically; they are the index of his character and 
soul. (By “soul,” I mean: a man’s consciousness and his basic motivating 
values.) 

There are, broadly, five (interconnected) areas that allow man to 
experience the enjoyment of life: productive work, human relationships, 
recreation, art, sex. 

Productive work is the most fundamental of these: through his work man 
gains his basic sense of control over existence — his sense of efficacy — 
which is the necessary foundation of the ability to enjoy any other value. 
The man whose life lacks direction or purpose, the man who has no creative 
goal, necessarily feels helpless and out of control; the man who feels 
helpless and out of control, feels inadequate to and unfit for existence; and 
the man who feels unfit for existence is incapable of enjoying it. 

One of the hallmarks of a man of self-esteem, who regards the universe as 
open to his effort, is the profound pleasure he experiences in the productive 
work of his mind; his enjoyment of life is fed by his unceasing concern to 
grow in knowledge and ability — to think, to achieve, to move forward, to 
meet new challenges and overcome them — to earn the pride of a constantly 
expanding efficacy. 

A different kind of soul is revealed by the man who, predominantly, takes 
pleasure in working only at the routine and familiar, who is inclined to enjoy 
working in a semi-daze, who sees happiness in freedom from challenge or 
struggle or effort: the soul of a man profoundly deficient in self-esteem, to 
whom the universe appears as unknowable and vaguely threatening, the man 
whose central motivating impulse is a longing for safety, not the safety that 
is won by efficacy, but the safety of a world in which efficacy is not 
demanded. 

Still a different kind of soul is revealed by the man who finds it 
inconceivable that work — any form of work — can be enjoyable, who regards 


58 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


the effort of earning a living as a necessary evil, who dreams only of the 
pleasures that begin when the workday ends, the pleasure of drowning his 
brain in alcohol or television or billiards or women, the pleasure of not being 
conscious : the soul of a man with scarcely a shred of self-esteem, who never 
expected the universe to be comprehensible and takes his lethargic dread of 
it for granted, and whose only form of relief and only notion of enjoyment is 
the dim flicker of undemanding sensations. 

Still another kind of soul is revealed by the man who takes pleasure, not 
in achievement, but in destruction, whose action is aimed, not at attaining 
efficacy, but at ruling those who have attained it: the soul of a man so 
abjectly lacking in self- value, and so overwhelmed by terror of existence, 
that his sole form of self-fulfillment is to unleash his resentment and hatred 
against those who do not share his state, those who are able to live — as if, by 
destroying the confident, the strong and the healthy, he could convert im- 
potence into efficacy. 

A rational, self-confident man is motivated by a love of values and by a 
desire to achieve them. A neurotic is motivated by fear and by a desire to 
escape it. This difference in motivation is reflected, not only in the things 
each type of man will seek for pleasure, but in the nature of the pleasure they 
will experience. 

The emotional quality of the pleasure experienced by the four men 
described above, for instance, is not the same. The quality of any pleasure 
depends on the mental processes that give rise to and attend it, and on the 
nature of the values involved. The pleasure of using one’s consciousness 
properly, and the “pleasure” of being unconscious, are not the same — just as 
the pleasure of achieving real values, of gaining an authentic sense of 
efficacy, and the “pleasure” of temporarily diminishing one’s sense of fear 
and helplessness, are not the same. The man of self-esteem experiences the 
pure, unadulterated enjoyment of using his faculties properly and of 
achieving actual values in reality — a pleasure of which the other three men 
can have no inkling, just as he has no inkling of the dim, murky state which 
they call “pleasure.” 

This same principle applies to all forms of enjoyment. Thus, in the realm 
of human relationships, a different form of pleasure is experienced, a 
different sort of motivation is involved, and a different kind of character is 
revealed, by the man who seeks for enjoyment the company of human 
beings of intelligence, integrity and self-esteem, who share his exacting 
standards — and by the man who is able to enjoy himself only with human 
beings who have no standards whatever and with whom, therefore, he feels 
free to be himself — or by the man who finds pleasure only in the company 


59 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


of people he despises, to whom he can compare himself favorably — or by 
the man who finds pleasure only among people he can deceive and 
manipulate, from whom he derives the lowest neurotic substitute for a sense 
of genuine efficacy: a sense of power. 

For the rational, psychologically healthy man, the desire for pleasure is 
the desire to celebrate his control over reality. For the neurotic, the desire for 
pleasure is the desire to escape from reality. 

Now consider the sphere of recreation. For instance, a party. A rational 
man enjoys a party as an emotional reward for achievement, and he can 
enjoy it only if in fact it involves activities that are enjoyable, such as seeing 
people whom he likes, meeting new people whom he finds interesting, 
engaging in conversations in which something worth saying and hearing is 
being said and heard. But a neurotic can “enjoy” a party for reasons 
unrelated to the real activities taking place; he may hate or despise or fear all 
the people present, he may act like a noisy fool and feel secretly ashamed of 
it — but he will feel that he is enjoying it all, because people are emitting the 
vibrations of approval, or because it is a social distinction to have been 
invited to this party, or because other people appear to be gay, or because 
the party has spared him, for the length of an evening, the terror of being 
alone. 

The “pleasure” of being drunk is obviously the pleasure of escaping from 
the responsibility of consciousness. And so are the kind of social gatherings, 
held for no other purpose than the expression of hysterical chaos, where the 
guests wander around in an alcoholic stupor, prattling noisily and 
senselessly, and enjoying the illusion of a universe where one is not bur- 
dened with purpose, logic, reality or awareness. 

Observe, in this connection, the modem “beatniks” — for instance, their 
manner of dancing. What one sees is not smiles of authentic enjoyment, but 
the vacant, staring eyes, the jerky, disorganized movements of what looks 
like decentralized bodies, all working very hard — with a kind of flat-footed 
hysteria — at projecting an air of the purposeless, the senseless, the mindless. 
This is the “pleasure” of unconsciousness. 

Or consider the quieter kind of “pleasures” that fill many people’s lives: 
family picnics, ladies’ parties or “coffee klatches,” charity bazaars, 
vegetative kinds of vacation — all of them occasions of quiet boredom for all 
concerned, in which the boredom is the value. Boredom, to such people, 
means safety, the known, the usual, the routine — the absence of the new, the 
exciting, the unfamiliar, the demanding. 


60 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


What is a demanding pleasure? A pleasure that demands the use of one’s 
mind; not in the sense of problem solving, but in the sense of exercising 
discrimination, judgment, awareness. 

One of the cardinal pleasures of life is offered to man by works of art. Art, 
at its highest potential, as the projection of things “as they might be and 
ought to be,” can provide man with an invaluable emotional fuel. But, again, 
the kind of art works one responds to, depends on one’s deepest values and 
premises. 

A man can seek the projection of the heroic, the intelligent, the 
efficacious, the dramatic, the purposeful, the stylized, the ingenious, the 
challenging; he can seek the pleasure of admiration, of looking up to great 
values. Or he can seek the satisfaction of contemplating gossip-column 
variants of the folks next door, with nothing demanded of him, neither in 
thought nor in value standards; he can feel himself pleasantly warmed by 
projections of the known and familiar, seeking to feel a little less of “a 
stranger and afraid in a world [he] never made.” Or his soul can vibrate 
affirmatively to projections of horror and human degradation, he can feel 
gratified by the thought that he’s not as bad as the dope-addicted dwarf or 
the crippled lesbian he’s reading about; he can relish an art which tells him 
that man is evil, that reality is unknowable, that existence is unendurable, 
that no one can help anything, that his secret terror is normal. 

Art projects an implicit view of existence — and it is one’s own view of 
existence that determines the art one will respond to. The soul of the man 
whose favorite play is Cyrano de Bergerac is radically different from the 
soul of the man whose favorite play is Waiting for Godot. 

Of the various pleasures that man can offer himself, the greatest is 
pride — the pleasure he takes in his own achievements and in the creation of 
his own character. The pleasure he takes in the character and achievements 
of another human being is that of admiration. The highest expression of the 
most intense union of these two responses — pride and admiration — is 
romantic love. Its celebration is sex. 

It is in this sphere above all — in a man’s romantic-sexual responses — that 
his view of himself and of existence stands eloquently revealed. A man falls 
in love with and sexually desires the person who reflects his own deepest 
values. 

There are two crucial respects in which a man’s romantic-sexual 
responses are psychologically revealing: in his choice of partner — and in the 
meaning, to him, of the sexual act. 

A man of self-esteem, a man in love with himself and with life, feels an 
intense need to find human beings he can admire — to find a spiritual equal 


61 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


whom he can love. The quality that will attract him most is self-esteem — 
self-esteem and an unclouded sense of the value of existence. To such a 
man, sex is an act of celebration, its meaning is a tribute to himself and to 
the woman he has chosen, the ultimate form of experiencing concretely and 
in his own person the value and joy of being alive. 

The need for such an experience is inherent in man’s nature. But if a man 
lacks the self-esteem to earn it, he attempts to fake it — and he chooses his 
partner (subconsciously) by the standard of her ability to help him fake it, to 
give him the illusion of a self-value he does not possess and of a happiness 
he does not feel. 

Thus, if a man is attracted to a woman of intelligence, confidence and 
strength, if he is attracted to a heroine, he reveals one kind of soul; if, 
instead, he is attracted to an irresponsible, helpless scatterbrain, whose 
weakness enables him to feel masculine, he reveals another kind of soul; if 
he is attracted to a frightened slut, whose lack of judgment and standards 
allows him to feel free of reproach, he reveals another kind of soul. 

The same principle, of course, applies to a woman’s romantic-sexual 
choices. 

The sexual act has a different meaning for the person whose desire is fed 
by pride and admiration, to whom the pleasurable self-experience it affords 
is an end in itself — and for the person who seeks in sex the proof of 
masculinity (or femininity), or the amelioration of despair, or a defense 
against anxiety, or an escape from boredom. 

Paradoxically, it is the so-called pleasure-chasers — the men who 
seemingly live for nothing but the sensation of the moment, who are 
concerned only with having “a good time” — who are psychologically 
incapable of enjoying pleasure as an end in itself. The neurotic pleasure- 
chaser imagines that, by going through the motions of a celebration, he will 
be able to make himself feel that he has something to celebrate. 

One of the hallmarks of the man who lacks self-esteem — and the real 
punishment for his moral and psychological default — is the fact that all his 
pleasures are pleasures of escape from the two pursuers whom he has 
betrayed and from whom there is no escape: reality and his own mind. 

Since the function of pleasure is to afford man a sense of his own 
efficacy, the neurotic is caught in a deadly conflict: he is compelled, by his 
nature as man, to feel a desperate need for pleasure, as a confirmation and 
expression of his control over reality — but he can find pleasure only in an 
escape from reality. That is the reason why his pleasures do not work, why 
they bring him, not a sense of pride, fulfillment, inspiration, but a sense of 
guilt, frustration, hopelessness, shame. The effect of pleasure on a man of 


62 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


self-esteem is that of a reward and a confirmation. The effect of pleasure on 
a man who lacks self-esteem is that of a threat — the threat of anxiety, the 
shaking of the precarious foundation of his /;.vewc/o-self-value, the 
sharpening of the ever-present fear that the structure will collapse and he 
will find himself face to face with a stem, absolute, unknown and 
unforgiving reality. 

One of the commonest complaints of patients who seek psychotherapy, is 
that nothing has the power to give them pleasure, that authentic enjoyment 
seems impossible to them. This is the inevitable dead end of the policy of 
pleasure-as-escape. 

To preserve an unclouded capacity for the enjoyment of life, is an unusual 
moral and psychological achievement. Contrary to popular belief, it is the 
prerogative, not of mindlessness, but of an unremitting devotion to the act of 
perceiving reality, and of a scmpulous intellectual integrity. It is the reward 
of self-esteem.

7. Doesn’t Life Require Compromise? 

by Ayn Rand 


A compromise is an adjustment of conflicting claims by mutual concessions. 
This means that both parties to a compromise have some valid claim and 
some value to offer each other. And this means that both parties agree upon 
some fundamental principle which serves as a base for their deal. 

It is only in regard to concretes or particulars, implementing a mutually 
accepted basic principle, that one may compromise. For instance, one may 
bargain with a buyer over the price one wants to receive for one’s product, 
and agree on a sum somewhere between one’s demand and his offer. The 
mutually accepted basic principle, in such case, is the principle of trade, 
namely: that the buyer must pay the seller for his product. But if one wanted 
to be paid and the alleged buyer wanted to obtain one’s product for nothing, 
no compromise, agreement or discussion would be possible, only the total 
surrender of one or the other. 

There can be no compromise between a property owner and a burglar; 
offering the burglar a single teaspoon of one’s silverware would not be a 
compromise, but a total surrender — the recognition of his right to one’s 
property. What value or concession did the burglar offer in return? And once 
the principle of unilateral concessions is accepted as the base of a 
relationship by both parties, it is only a matter of time before the burglar 
would seize the rest. As an example of this process, observe the present 
foreign policy of the United States. 

There can be no compromise between freedom and government controls; 
to accept “just a few controls” is to surrender the principle of inalienable 
individual rights and to substitute for it the principle of the government’s 
unlimited, arbitrary power, thus delivering oneself into gradual enslavement. 
As an example of this process, observe the present domestic policy of the 
United States. 

There can be no compromise on basic principles or on fundamental issues. 
What would you regard as a “compromise” between life and death? Or 
between truth and falsehood? Or between reason and irrationality? 

Today, however, when people speak of “compromise,” what they mean is 
not a legitimate mutual concession or a trade, but precisely the betrayal of 
one’s principles — the unilateral surrender to any groundless, irrational claim. 
The root of that doctrine is ethical subjectivism, which holds that a desire or 
a whim is an irreducible moral primary, that every man is entitled to any 


64 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


desire he might feel like asserting, that all desires have equal moral validity, 
and that the only way men can get along together is by giving in to anything 
and “compromising” with anyone. It is not hard to see who would profit and 
who would lose by such a doctrine. 

The immorality of this doctrine — and the reason why the term 
“compromise” implies, in today’s general usage, an act of moral treason — 
lies in the fact that it requires men to accept ethical subjectivism as the basic 
principle superseding all principles in human relationships and to sacrifice 
anything as a concession to one another’s whims. 

The question “Doesn’t life require compromise?” is usually asked by 
those who fail to differentiate between a basic principle and some concrete, 
specific wish. Accepting a lesser job than one had wanted is not a 
“compromise.” Taking orders from one’s employer on how to do the work 
for which one is hired, is not a “compromise.” Failing to have a cake after 
one has eaten it, is not a “compromise.” 

Integrity does not consist of loyalty to one’s subjective whims, but of 
loyalty to rational principles. A “compromise” (in the unprincipled sense of 
that word) is not a breach of one’s comfort, but a breach of one’s 
convictions. A “compromise” does not consist of doing something one 
dislikes, but of doing something one knows to be evil. Accompanying one’s 
husband or wife to a concert, when one does not care for music, is not a 
“compromise”; surrendering to his or her irrational demands for social 
conformity, for pretended religious observance or for generosity toward 
boorish in-laws, is. Working for an employer who does not share one’s 
ideas, is not a “compromise”; pretending to share his ideas, is. Accepting a 
publisher’s suggestions to make changes in one’s manuscript, when one sees 
the rational validity of his suggestions, is not a “compromise”; making such 
changes in order to please him or to please “the public,” against one’s own 
judgment and standards, is. 

The excuse, given in all such cases, is that the “compromise” is only 
temporary and that one will reclaim one’s integrity at some indeterminate 
future date. But one cannot correct a husband’s or wife’s irrationality by 
giving in to it and encouraging it to grow. One cannot achieve the victory of 
one’s ideas by helping to propagate their opposite. One cannot offer a 
literary masterpiece, “when one has become rich and famous,” to a 
following one has acquired by writing trash. If one found it difficult to 
maintain one’s loyalty to one’s own convictions at the start, a succession of 
betrayals — which helped to augment the power of the evil one lacked the 
courage to fight — will not make it easier at a later date, but will make it 
virtually impossible.

There can be no compromise on moral principles. “In any compromise 
between food and poison, it is only death that can win. In any compromise 
between good and evil, it is only evil that can profit.” (Atlas Shrugged .) The 
next time you are tempted to ask: “Doesn’t life require compromise?” 
translate that question into its actual meaning: “Doesn’t life require the 
surrender of that which is true and good to that which is false and evil?” The 
answer is that that precisely is what life forbids — if one wishes to achieve 
anything but a stretch of tortured years spent in progressive self-destruction.

8. How Does One Lead a Rational Life in an 
irrational Society? 

by Ayn Rand 


I will confine my answer to a single, fundamental aspect of this question. I 
will name only one principle, the opposite of the idea which is so prevalent 
today and which is responsible for the spread of evil in the world. That 
principle is: One must never fail to pronounce moral judgment. 

Nothing can corrupt and disintegrate a culture or a man’s character as 
thoroughly as does the precept of moral agnosticism, the idea that one must 
never pass moral judgment on others, that one must be morally tolerant of 
anything, that the good consists of never distinguishing good from evil. 

It is obvious who profits and who loses by such a precept. It is not justice 
or equal treatment that you grant to men when you abstain equally from 
praising men’s virtues and from condemning men’s vices. When your 
impartial attitude declares, in effect, that neither the good nor the evil may 
expect anything from you — whom do you betray and whom do you 
encourage? 

But to pronounce moral judgment is an enormous responsibility. To be a 
judge, one must possess an unimpeachable character; one need not be 
omniscient or infallible, and it is not an issue of errors of knowledge; one 
needs an unbreached integrity, that is, the absence of any indulgence in 
conscious, willful evil. Just as a judge in a court of law may err, when the 
evidence is inconclusive, but may not evade the evidence available, nor 
accept bribes, nor allow any personal feeling, emotion, desire or fear to 
obstruct his mind’s judgment of the facts of reality — so every rational person 
must maintain an equally strict and solemn integrity in the courtroom within 
his own mind, where the responsibility is more awesome than in a public 
tribunal, because he, the judge, is the only one to know when he has been 
impeached. 

There is, however, a court of appeal from one’s judgments: objective 
reality. A judge puts himself on trial every time he pronounces a verdict. It is 
only in today’s reign of amoral cynicism, subjectivism and hooliganism that 
men may imagine themselves free to utter any sort of irrational judgment 
and to suffer no consequences. But, in fact, a man is to be judged by the 
judgments he pronounces. The things which he condemns or extols exist in 
objective reality and are open to the independent appraisal of others. It is his 
own moral character and standards that he reveals, when he blames or 


67 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


praises. If he condemns America and extols Soviet Russia — or if he attacks 
businessmen and defends juvenile delinquents — or if he denounces a great 
work of art and praises trash — it is the nature of his own soul that he 
confesses. 

It is their fear of this responsibility that prompts most people to adopt an 
attitude of indiscriminate moral neutrality. It is the fear best expressed in the 
precept: “Judge not, that ye be not judged.” But that precept, in fact, is an 
abdication of moral responsibility: it is a moral blank check one gives to 
others in exchange for a moral blank check one expects for oneself. 

There is no escape from the fact that men have to make choices; so long 
as men have to make choices, there is no escape from moral values; so long 
as moral values are at stake, no moral neutrality is possible. To abstain from 
condemning a torturer, is to become an accessory to the torture and murder 
of his victims. 

The moral principle to adopt in this issue, is: “Judge, and be prepared to 
be judged .” 

The opposite of moral neutrality is not a blind, arbitrary, self-righteous 
condemnation of any idea, action or person that does not fit one’s mood, 
one’s memorized slogans or one’s snap judgment of the moment. 
Indiscriminate tolerance and indiscriminate condemnation are not two 
opposites: they are two variants of the same evasion. To declare that 
“everybody is white” or “everybody is black” or “everybody is neither white 
nor black, but gray,” is not a moral judgment, but an escape from the 
responsibility of moral judgment. 

To judge means: to evaluate a given concrete by reference to an abstract 
principle or standard. It is not an easy task; it is not a task that can be 
performed automatically by one’s feelings, “instincts” or hunches. It is a task 
that requires the most precise, the most exacting, the most ruthlessly 
objective and rational process of thought. It is fairly easy to grasp abstract 
moral principles; it can be very difficult to apply them to a given situation, 
particularly when it involves the moral character of another person. When 
one pronounces moral judgment, whether in praise or in blame, one must be 
prepared to answer “Why?” and to prove one’s case — to oneself and to any 
rational inquirer. 

The policy of always pronouncing moral judgment does not mean that one 
must regard oneself as a missionary charged with the responsibility of 
“saving everyone’s soul” — nor that one must give unsolicited moral 
appraisals to all those one meets. It means: (a) that one must know clearly, in 
full, verbally identified form, one’s own moral evaluation of every person, 
issue and event with which one deals, and act accordingly; (b) that one must 


68 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


make one’s moral evaluation known to others, when it is rationally 
appropriate to do so. 

This last means that one need not launch into unprovoked moral 
denunciations or debates, but that one must speak up in situations where 
silence can objectively be taken to mean agreement with or sanction of evil. 
When one deals with irrational persons, where argument is futile, a mere “I 
don’t agree with you” is sufficient to negate any implication of moral 
sanction. When one deals with better people, a full statement of one’s views 
may be morally required. But in no case and in no situation may one permit 
one’s own values to be attacked or denounced, and keep silent. 

Moral values are the motive power of a man’s actions. By pronouncing 
moral judgment, one protects the clarity of one’s own perception and the 
rationality of the course one chooses to pursue. It makes a difference 
whether one thinks that one is dealing with human errors of knowledge or 
with human evil. 

Observe how many people evade, rationalize and drive their minds into a 
state of blind stupor, in dread of discovering that those they deal with — their 
“loved ones” or friends or business associates or political rulers — are not 
merely mistaken, but evil. Observe that this dread leads them to sanction, to 
help and to spread the very evil whose existence they fear to acknowledge. 

If people did not indulge in such abject evasions as the claim that some 
contemptible liar “means well” — that a mooching bum “can’t help it” — that 
a juvenile delinquent “needs love” — that a criminal “doesn’t know any 
better” — that a power-seeking politician is moved by patriotic concern for 
“the public good” — that communists are merely “agrarian reformers” — the 
history of the past few decades, or centuries, would have been different. 

Ask yourself why totalitarian dictatorships find it necessary to pour 
money and effort into propaganda for their own helpless, chained, gagged 
slaves, who have no means of protest or defense. The answer is that even the 
humblest peasant or the lowest savage would rise in blind rebellion, were he 
to realize that he is being immolated, not to some incomprehensible “noble 
purpose,” but to plain, naked human evil. 

Observe also that moral neutrality necessitates a progressive sympathy for 
vice and a progressive antagonism to virtue. A man who struggles not to 
acknowledge that evil is evil, finds it increasingly dangerous to acknowledge 
that the good is the good. To him, a person of virtue is a threat that can 
topple all of his evasions — particularly when an issue of justice is involved, 
which demands that he take sides. It is then that such formulas as “Nobody 
is ever fully right or fully wrong” and “Who am I to judge?” take their lethal 
effect. The man who begins by saying: “There is some good in the worst of 


69 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


us,” goes on to say: “There is some bad in the best of us” — then: “There’s 
got to be some bad in the best of us” — and then: “It’s the best of us who 
make life difficult — why don’t they keep silent? — who are they to judge?” 

And then, on some gray, middle-aged morning, such a man realizes 
suddenly that he has betrayed all the values he had loved in his distant 
spring, and wonders how it happened, and slams his mind shut to the 
answer, by telling himself hastily that the fear he had felt in his worst, most 
shameful moments was right and that values have no chance in this world. 

An irrational society is a society of moral cowards — of men paralyzed by 
the loss of moral standards, principles and goals. But since men have to act, 
so long as they live, such a society is ready to be taken over by anyone 
willing to set its direction. The initiative can come from only two types of 
men: either from the man who is willing to assume the responsibility of 
asserting rational values — or from the thug who is not troubled by questions 
of responsibility. 

No matter how hard the struggle, there is only one choice that a rational 
man can make in the face of such an alternative.

9. The Cult of Moral Grayness 

by Ayn Rand 


One of the most eloquent symptoms of the moral bankruptcy of today’s 
culture, is a certain fashionable attitude toward moral issues, best 
summarized as: “There are no blacks and whites, there are only grays.” 

This is asserted in regard to persons, actions, principles of conduct, and 
morality in general. “Black and white,” in this context, means “good and 
evil.” (The reverse order used in that catch phrase is interesting 
psychologically.) 

In any respect one cares to examine, that notion is full of contradictions 
(foremost among them is the fallacy of “the stolen concept”). If there is no 
black and white, there can be no gray — since gray is merely a mixture of the 
two. 

Before one can identify anything as “gray,” one has to know what is black 
and what is white. In the field of morality, this means that one must first 
identify what is good and what is evil. And when a man has ascertained that 
one alternative is good and the other is evil, he has no justification for 
choosing a mixture. There can be no justification for choosing any part of 
that which one knows to be evil. In morality, “black” is predominantly the 
result of attempting to pretend to oneself that one is merely “gray.” 

If a moral code (such as altruism) is, in fact, impossible to practice, it is 
the code that must be condemned as “black,” not its victims evaluated as 
“gray.” If a moral code prescribes irreconcilable contradictions — so that by 
choosing the good in one respect, a man becomes evil in another — it is the 
code that must be rejected as “black.” If a moral code is inapplicable to 
reality — if it offers no guidance except a series of arbitrary, groundless, out- 
of-context injunctions and commandments, to be accepted on faith and 
practiced automatically, as blind dogma — its practitioners cannot properly 
be classified as “white” or “black” or “gray”: a moral code that forbids and 
paralyzes moral judgment is a contradiction in terms. 

If, in a complex moral issue, a man struggles to determine what is right, 
and fails or makes an honest error, he cannot be regarded as “gray”; morally, 
he is “white.” Errors of knowledge are not breaches of morality; no proper 
moral code can demand infallibility or omniscience. 

But if, in order to escape the responsibility of moral judgment, a man 
closes his eyes and mind, if he evades the facts of the issue and struggles not 


71 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


to know , he cannot be regarded as “gray”; morally, he is as “black” as they 
come. 

Many forms of confusion, uncertainty and epistemological sloppiness 
help to obscure the contradictions and to disguise the actual meaning of the 
doctrine of moral grayness. 

Some people believe that it is merely a restatement of such bromides as 
“Nobody is perfect in this world” — i.e., everybody is a mixture of good and 
evil, and, therefore, morally “gray.” Since the majority of those one meets 
are likely to fit that description, people accept it as some sort of natural fact, 
without further thought. They forget that morality deals only with issues 
open to man’s choice (i.e., to his free will) — and, therefore, that no statistical 
generalizations are valid in this matter. 

If man is “gray” by nature, no moral concepts are applicable to him, 
including “grayness,” and no such thing as morality is possible. But if man 
has free will, then the fact that ten (or ten million) men made the wrong 
choice, does not necessitate that the eleventh one will make it; it necessitates 
nothing — and proves nothing — in regard to any given individual. 

There are many reasons why most people are morally imperfect, i.e., hold 
mixed, contradictory premises and values (the altruist morality is one of the 
reasons), but that is a different issue. Regardless of the reasons of their 
choices, the fact that most people are morally “gray,” does not invalidate 
man’s need of morality and of moral “whiteness”; if anything, it makes the 
need more urgent. Nor does it warrant the epistemological “package deal” of 
dismissing the problem by consigning all men to moral “grayness” and thus 
refusing to recognize or to practice “whiteness.” Nor does it serve as an 
escape from the responsibility of moral judgment: unless one is prepared to 
dispense with morality altogether and to regard a petty chiseller and a 
murderer as morally equal, one still has to judge and evaluate the many 
shadings of “gray” that one may encounter in the characters of individual 
men. (And the only way to judge them is by a clearly defined criterion of 
“black” and “white.”) 

A similar notion, involving similar errors, is held by some people who 
believe that the doctrine of moral grayness is merely a restatement of the 
proposition: “There are two sides to every issue,” which they take to mean 
that nobody is ever fully right or fully wrong. But that is not what that 
proposition means or implies. It implies only that in judging an issue, one 
should take cognizance of or give a hearing to both sides. This does not 
mean that the claims of both sides will necessarily be equally valid, nor even 
that there will be some modicum of justice on both sides. More often than 


72 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


not, justice will be on one side, and unwarranted presumption (or worse) on 
the other. 

There are, of course, complex issues in which both sides are right in some 
respects and wrong in others — and it is here that the “package deal” of 
pronouncing both sides “gray” is least permissible. It is in such issues that 
the most rigorous precision of moral judgment is required to identify and 
evaluate the various aspects involved — which can be done only by 
unscrambling the mixed elements of “black” and “white.” 

The basic error in all these various confusions is the same: it consists of 
forgetting that morality deals only with issues open to man’s choice — which 
means: forgetting the difference between “unable” and “unwilling.” This 
permits people to translate the catch phrase “There are no blacks and whites” 
into: “Men are unable to be wholly good or wholly evil” — which they 
accept, in foggy resignation, without questioning the metaphysical 
contradictions it entails. 

But not many people would accept it, if that catch phrase were translated 
into the actual meaning it is intended to smuggle into their minds: “Men are 
unwilling to be wholly good or wholly evil.” 

The first thing one would say to any advocate of such a proposition, is: 
“Speak for yourself, brother!” And that , in effect, is what he is actually 
doing; consciously or subconsciously, intentionally or inadvertently, when a 
man declares: “There are no blacks and whites,” he is making a 
psychological confession, and what he means is: “/ am unwilling to be 
wholly good — and please don’t regard me as wholly evil!” 

Just as, in epistemology, the cult of uncertainty is a revolt against 
reason — so, in ethics, the cult of moral grayness is a revolt against moral 
values. Both are a revolt against the absolutism of reality. 

Just as the cult of uncertainty could not succeed by an open rebellion 
against reason and, therefore, struggles to elevate the negation of reason into 
some sort of superior reasoning — so the cult of moral grayness could not 
succeed by an open rebellion against morality, and struggles to elevate the 
negation of morality into a superior kind of virtue. 

Observe the form in which one encounters that doctrine: it is seldom 
presented as a positive, as an ethical theory or a subject of discussion; 
predominantly, one hears it as a negative, as a snap objection or reproach, 
uttered in a manner implying that one is guilty of breaching an absolute so 
self-evident as to require no discussion. In tones ranging from astonishment 
to sarcasm to anger to indignation to hysterical hatred, the doctrine is thrown 
at you in the form of an accusatory: “Surely you don’t thi nk in terms of 
black-and-white, do you?” 


73 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


Prompted by confusion, helplessness and fear of the entire subject of 
morality, most people hasten to answer guiltily: “No, of course, I don’t,” 
without any clear idea of the nature of the accusation. They do not pause to 
grasp that that accusation is saying, in effect: “Surely you are not so unfair 
as to discriminate between good and evil, are you?” — or: “Surely you are not 
so evil as to seek the good, are you?” — or: “Surely you are not so immoral 
as to believe in morality!” 

Moral guilt, fear of moral judgment, and a plea for blanket forgiveness, 
are so obviously the motive of that catch phrase that a glance at reality 
would be sufficient to tell its proponents what an ugly confession they are 
uttering. But escape from reality is both the precondition and the goal of the 
cult of moral grayness. 

Philosophically, that cult is a negation of morality — but, psychologically, 
this is not its adherents’ goal. What they seek is not amorality, but something 
more profoundly irrational a nonabsolute, fluid, elastic, middle-of-the-road 
morality. They do not proclaim themselves “beyond good and evil” — they 
seek to preserve the “advantages” of both. They are not moral challengers, 
nor do they represent a medieval version of flamboyant evil worshipers. 
What gives them their peculiarly modem flavor is that they do not advocate 
selling one’s soul to the Devil; they advocate selling it piecemeal, bit by bit, 
to any retail bidder. 

They are not a philosophical school of thought; they are the typical 
product of philosophical default — of the intellectual bankruptcy that has 
produced irrationalism in epistemology, a moral vacuum in ethics, and a 
mixed economy in politics. A mixed economy is an amoral war of pressure 
groups, devoid of principles, values or any reference to justice, a war whose 
ultimate weapon is the power of bmte force, but whose outward form is a 
game of compromise. The cult of moral grayness is the ersatz morality 
which made it possible and to which men now cling in a panicky attempt to 
justify it. 

Observe that their dominant overtone is not a quest for the “white,” but an 
obsessive terror of being branded “black” (and with good reason). Observe 
that they are pleading for a morality which would hold compromise as its 
standard of value and would thus make it possible to gauge virtue by the 
number of values one is willing to betray. 

The consequences and the “vested interests” of their doctrine are visible 
all around us. 

Observe, in politics, that the term extremism has become a synonym of 
“evil,” regardless of the content of the issue (the evil is not what you are 
“extreme” about, but that you are “extreme” — i.e., consistent). Observe the 


74 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


phenomenon of the so-called neutralists in the United Nations: the 
“neutralists” are worse than merely neutral in the conflict between the 
United States and Soviet Russia; they are committed, on principle , to see no 
difference between the two sides, never to consider the merits of an issue, 
and always to seek a compromise, any compromise in any conflict — as, for 
instance, between an aggressor and an invaded country. 

Observe, in literature, the emergence of a thing called anti-hero, whose 
distinction is that he possesses no distinction — no virtues, no values, no 
goals, no character, no significance — yet who occupies, in plays and novels, 
the position formerly held by a hero, with the story centered on his actions, 
even though he does nothing and gets nowhere. Observe that the term “good 
guys and bad guys” is used as a sneer — and, particularly in television, 
observe the revolt against happy endings, the demands that the “bad guys” 
be given an equal chance and an equal number of victories. 

Like a mixed economy, men of mixed premises may be called “gray”; but, 
in both cases, the mixture does not remain “gray” for long. “Gray,” in this 
context, is merely a prelude to “black.” There may be “gray” men, but there 
can be no “gray” moral principles. Morality is a code of black and white. 
When and if men attempt a compromise, it is obvious which side will 
necessarily lose and which will necessarily profit. 

Such are the reasons why — when one is asked: “Surely you don’t think in 
terms of black-and-white, do you?” — the proper answer (in essence, if not in 
form) should be: “You’re damn right 1 do!”

10. Collectivized Ethics 

by Ayn Rand 


Certain questions, which one frequently hears, are not philosophical queries, 
but psychological confessions. This is particularly true in the field of ethics. 
It is especially in discussions of ethics that one must check one’s premises 
(or remember them), and more: one must learn to check the premises of 
one’s adversaries. 

For instance, Objectivists will often hear a question such as: “What will 
be done about the poor or the handicapped in a free society?” 

The altruist-collectivist premise, implicit in that question, is that men are 
“their brothers’ keepers” and that the misfortune of some is a mortgage on 
others. The questioner is ignoring or evading the basic premises of 
Objectivist ethics and is attempting to switch the discussion onto his own 
collectivist base. Observe that he does not ask: “Should anything be done?” 
but: “ What will be done?” — as if the collectivist premise had been tacitly 
accepted and all that remains is a discussion of the means to implement it. 

Once, when Barbara Branden was asked by a student: “What will happen 
to the poor in an Objectivist society?” — she answered: “If you want to help 
them, you will not be stopped.” 

This is the essence of the whole issue and a perfect example of how one 
refuses to accept an adversary’s premises as the basis of discussion. 

Only individual men have the right to decide when or whether they wish 
to help others; society — as an organized political system — has no rights in 
the matter at all. 

On the question of when and under what conditions it is morally proper 
for an individual to help others, I refer you to Galt’s speech in Atlas 
Shrugged. What concerns us here is the collectivist premise of regarding this 
issue as political, as the problem or duty of “society as a whole.” 

Since nature does not guarantee automatic security, success and survival 
to any human being, it is only the dictatorial presumptuousness and the 
moral cannibalism of the altruist-collectivist code that permits a man to 
suppose (or idly to daydream) that he can somehow guarantee such security 
to some men at the expense of others. 

If a man speculates on what “society” should do for the poor, he accepts 
thereby the collectivist premise that men’s lives belong to society and that 
he, as a member of society, has the right to dispose of them, to set their goals 
or to plan the “distribution” of their efforts.

This is the psychological confession implied in such questions and in 
many issues of the same kind. 

At best, it reveals a man’s psycho-epistemological chaos; it reveals a 
fallacy which may be termed “the fallacy of the frozen abstraction” and 
which consists of substituting some one particular concrete for the wider 
abstract class to which it belongs — in this case, substituting a specific ethics 
(altruism) for the wider abstraction of “ethics.” Thus, a man may reject the 
theory of altruism and assert that he has accepted a rational code — but, 
failing to integrate his ideas, he continues unthinkingly to approach ethical 
questions in terms established by altruism. 

More often, however, that psychological confession reveals a deeper evil: 
it reveals the enormity of the extent to which altruism erodes men’s capacity 
to grasp the concept of rights or the value of an individual life; it reveals a 
mind from which the reality of a human being has been wiped out. 

Humility and presumptuousness are always two sides of the same 
premise, and always share the task of filling the space vacated by self- 
esteem in a collectivized mentality. The man who is willing to serve as the 
means to the ends of others, will necessarily regard others as the means to 
his ends. The more neurotic he is or the more conscientious in the practice of 
altruism (and these two aspects of his psychology will act reciprocally to 
reinforce each other), the more he will tend to devise schemes “for the good 
of mankind” or of “society” or of “the public” or of “future generations” — or 
of anything except actual human beings. 

Hence the appalling recklessness with which men propose, discuss and 
accept “humanitarian” projects which are to be imposed by political means, 
that is, by force, on an unlimited number of human beings. If, according to 
collectivist caricatures, the greedy rich indulged in profligate material 
luxury, on the premise of “price no object” — then the social progress 
brought by today’s collectivized mentalities consists of indulging in 
altruistic political planning, on the premise of “human lives no object.” 

The hallmark of such mentalities is the advocacy of some grand scale 
public goal, without regard to context, costs or means. Out of context, such a 
goal can usually be shown to be desirable; it has to be public, because the 
costs are not to be earned, but to be expropriated; and a dense patch of 
venomous fog has to shroud the issue of means — because the means are to 
be human lives. 

“Medicare” is an example of such a project. “Isn’t it desirable that the 
aged should have medical care in times of illness?” its advocates clamor. 
Considered out of context, the answer would be: yes, it is desirable. Who 
would have a reason to say no? And it is at this point that the mental 


77 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


processes of a collectivized brain are cut off; the rest is fog. Only the desire 
remains in his sight — it’s the good, isn’t it? — it’s not for myself, it’s for 
others, it’s for the public, for a helpless, ailing public ... The fog hides such 
facts as the enslavement and, therefore, the destruction of medical science, 
the regimentation and disintegration of all medical practice, and the sacrifice 
of the professional integrity, the freedom, the careers, the ambitions, the 
achievements, the happiness, the lives of the very men who are to provide 
that “desirable” goal — the doctors. 

After centuries of civilization, most men — with the exception of 
criminals — have learned that the above mental attitude is neither practical 
nor moral in their private lives and may not be applied to the achievement of 
their private goals. There would be no controversy about the moral character 
of some young hoodlum who declared: “Isn’t it desirable to have a yacht, to 
live in a penthouse and to drink champagne?” — and stubbornly refused to 
consider the fact that he had robbed a bank and killed two guards to achieve 
that “desirable” goal. 

There is no moral difference between these two examples; the number of 
beneficiaries does not change the nature of the action, it merely increases the 
number of victims. In fact, the private hoodlum has a slight edge of moral 
superiority: he has no power to devastate an entire nation and his victims are 
not legally disarmed. 

It is men’s views of their public or political existence that the 
collectivized ethics of altruism has protected from the march of civilization 
and has preserved as a reservoir, a wildlife sanctuary, ruled by the mores of 
prehistorical savagery. If men have grasped some faint glimmer of respect 
for individual rights in their private dealings with one another, that glimmer 
vanishes when they turn to public issues — and what leaps into the political 
arena is a caveman who can’t conceive of any reason why the tribe may not 
bash in the skull of any individual if it so desires. 

The distinguishing characteristic of such tribal mentality is: the axiomatic, 
the almost “instinctive” view of human life as the fodder, fuel or means for 
any public project. 

The examples of such projects are innumerable: “Isn’t it desirable to clean 
up the slums?” (dropping the context of what happens to those in the next 
income bracket) — ’’Isn’t it desirable to have beautiful, planned cities, all of 
one harmonious style?” (dropping the context of whose choice of style is to 
be forced on the home builders) — ’’Isn’t it desirable to have an educated 
public?” (dropping the context of who will do the educating, what will be 
taught, and what will happen to dissenters) — ’’Isn’t it desirable to liberate the 
artists, the writers, the composers from the burden of financial problems and 


78 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


leave them free to create?” (dropping the context of such questions as: which 
artists, writers and composers? — chosen by whom? — at whose expense? — at 
the expense of the artists, writers and composers who have no political pull 
and whose miserably precarious incomes will be taxed to “liberate” that 
privileged elite?) — ’’Isn’t science desirable? Isn’t it desirable for man to 
conquer space?” 

And here we come to the essence of the unreality — the savage, blind, 
ghastly, bloody unreality — that motivates a collectivized soul. 

The unanswered and unanswerable question in all of their “desirable” 
goals is: To whom ? Desires and goals presuppose beneficiaries. Is science 
desirable? To whomi Not to the Soviet serfs who die of epidemics, filth, 
starvation, terror and firing squads — while some bright young men wave to 
them from space capsules circling over their human pigsties. And not to the 
American father who died of heart failure brought on by overwork, 
struggling to send his son through college — or to the boy who could not 
afford college — or to the couple killed in an automobile wreck, because they 
could not afford a new car — or to the mother who lost her child because she 
could not afford to send him to the best hospital — not to any of those people 
whose taxes pay for the support of our subsidized science and public 
research projects. 

Science is a value only because it expands, enriches and protects man’s 
life. It is not a value outside that context. Nothing is a value outside that 
context. And “man’s life” means the single, specific, irreplaceable lives of 
individual men. 

The discovery of new knowledge is a value to men only when and if they 
are free to use and enjoy the benefits of the previously known. New 
discoveries are a potential value to all men, but not at the price of sacrificing 
all of their actual values. A “progress” extended into infinity, which brings 
no benefit to anyone, is a monstrous absurdity. And so is the “conquest of 
space” by some men, when and if it is accomplished by expropriating the 
labor of other men who are left without means to acquire a pair of shoes. 

Progress can come only out of men’s surplus, that is: from the work of 
those men whose ability produces more than their personal consumption 
requires, those who are intellectually and financially able to venture out in 
pursuit of the new. Capitalism is the only system where such men are free to 
function and where progress is accompanied, not by forced privations, but 
by a constant rise in the general level of prosperity, of consumption and of 
enjoyment of life. 

It is only to the frozen unreality inside a collectivized brain that human 
lives are interchangeable — and only such a brain can contemplate as “moral” 


79 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


or “desirable” the sacrifice of generations of living men for the alleged 
benefits which public science or public industry or public concerts will bring 
to the unborn. 

Soviet Russia is the clearest, but not the only, illustration of the 
achievements of collectivized mentalities. Two generations of Russians have 
lived, toiled and died in misery, waiting for the abundance promised by their 
rulers, who pleaded for patience and commanded austerity, while building 
public “industrialization” and killing public hope in five-year installments. 
At first, the people starved while waiting for electric generators and tractors; 
they are still starving, while waiting for atomic energy and interplanetary 
travel. 

That waiting has no end — the unborn profiteers of that wholesale 
sacrificial slaughter will never be bom — the sacrificial animals will merely 
breed new hordes of sacrificial animals — as the history of all tyrannies has 
demonstrated — while the unfocused eyes of a collectivized brain will stare 
on, undeterred, and speak of a vision of service to mankind, mixing 
interchangeably the corpses of the present with the ghosts of the future, but 
seeing no men. 

Such is the status of reality in the soul of any Milquetoast who looks with 
envy at the achievements of industrialists and dreams of what beautiful 
public parks he could create if only everyone’s lives, efforts and resources 
were turned over to him. 

All public projects are mausoleums, not always in shape, but always in 
cost. 

The next time you encounter one of those “public-spirited” dreamers who 
tells you rancorously that “some very desirable goals cannot be achieved 
without everybody’s participation,” tell him that if he cannot obtain 
everybody’s voluntary participation, his goals had jolly well better remain 
unachieved — and that men’s lives are not his to dispose of. 

And, if you wish, give him the following example of the ideals he 
advocates. It is medically possible to take the corneas of a man’s eyes 
immediately after his death and transplant them to the eyes of a living man 
who is blind, thus restoring his sight (in certain types of blindness). Now, 
according to collectivized ethics, this poses a social problem. Should we 
wait until a man’s death to cut out his eyes, when other men need them? 
Should we regard everybody’s eyes as public property and devise a “fair 
method of distribution”? Would you advocate cutting out a living man’s eye 
and giving it to a blind man, so as to “equalize” them? No? Then don’t 
struggle any further with questions about “public projects” in a free society. 
You know the answer. The principle is the same.

11. The Monument Builders 

by Ayn Rand 


What had once been an alleged ideal is now a ragged skeleton rattling like a 
scarecrow in the wind over the whole world, but men lack the courage to 
glance up and to discover the grinning skull under the bloody rags. That 
skeleton is socialism. 

Fifty years ago, there might have been some excuse (though not 
justification) for the widespread belief that socialism is a political theory 
motivated by benevolence and aimed at the achievement of men’s well- 
being. Today, that belief can no longer be regarded as an innocent error. So- 
cialism has been tried on every continent of the globe. In the light of its 
results, it is time to question the motives of socialism’s advocates. 

The essential characteristic of socialism is the denial of individual 
property rights; under socialism, the right to property (which is the right of 
use and disposal) is vested in “society as a whole,” i.e., in the collective, 
with production and distribution controlled by the state, i.e., by the 
government. 

Socialism may be established by force, as in the Union of Soviet Socialist 
Republics — or by vote, as in Nazi (National Socialist) Germany. The degree 
of socialization may be total, as in Russia — or partial, as in England. 
Theoretically, the differences are superficial; practically, they are only a 
matter of time. The basic principle, in all cases, is the same. 

The alleged goals of socialism were: the abolition of poverty, the 
achievement of general prosperity, progress, peace and human brotherhood. 
The results have been a terrifying failure — terrifying, that is, if one’s motive 
is men’s welfare. 

Instead of prosperity, socialism has brought economic paralysis and/or 
collapse to every country that tried it. The degree of socialization has been 
the degree of disaster. The consequences have varied accordingly. 

England, once the freest and proudest nation of Europe, has been reduced 
to the status of a second-rate power and is perishing slowly from hemophilia, 
losing the best of her economic blood: the middle class and the professions. 
The able, competent, productive, independent men are leaving by the 
thousands, migrating to Canada or the United States, in search of freedom. 
They are escaping from the reign of mediocrity, from the mawkish 
poorhouse where, having sold their rights in exchange for free dentures, the 
inmates are now whining that they’d rather be Red than dead. 


82 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


In more fully socialized countries, famine was the start, the insignia 
announcing socialist rule — as in Soviet Russia, as in Red China, as in Cuba. 
In those countries, socialism reduced the people to the unspeakable poverty 
of the pre-industrial ages, to literal starvation, and has kept them on a 
stagnant level of misery. 

No, it is not “just temporary,” as socialism’s apologists have been 
saying — for half a century. After forty-five years of government planning, 
Russia is still unable to solve the problem of feeding her population. 

As far as superior productivity and speed of economic progress are 
concerned, the question of any comparisons between capitalism and 
socialism has been answered once and for all — for any honest person — by 
the present difference between West and East Berlin. 

Instead of peace, socialism has introduced a new kind of gruesome lunacy 
into international relations — the “cold war,” which is a state of chronic war 
with undeclared periods of peace between wantonly sudden invasions — with 
Russia seizing one-third of the globe, with socialist tribes and nations at one 
another’s throats, with socialist India invading Goa, and communist China 
invading socialist India. 

An eloquent sign of the moral corruption of our age is the callous 
complacency with which most of the socialists and their sympathizers, the 
“liberals,” regard the atrocities perpetrated in socialistic countries and accept 
rule by terror as a way of life — while posturing as advocates of “human 
brotherhood.” In the 1930’s, they did protest against the atrocities of Nazi 
Germany. But, apparently, it was not an issue of principle, but only the 
protest of a rival gang fighting for the same territory — because we do not 
hear their voices any longer. 

In the name of “humanity,” they condone and accept the following: the 
abolition of all freedom and all rights, the expropriation of all property, 
executions without trial, torture chambers, slave-labor camps, the mass 
slaughter of countless millions in Soviet Russia — and the bloody horror of 
East Berlin, including the bullet-riddled bodies of fleeing children. 

When one observes the nightmare of the desperate efforts made by 
hundreds of thousands of people struggling to escape from the socialized 
countries of Europe, to escape over barbed-wire fences, under machine-gun 
fire — one can no longer believe that socialism, in any of its forms, is moti- 
vated by benevolence and by the desire to achieve men’s welfare. 

No man of authentic benevolence could evade or ignore so great a horror 
on so vast a scale. 

Socialism is not a movement of the people. It is a movement of the 
intellectuals, originated, led and controlled by the intellectuals, carried by 


83 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


them out of their stuffy ivory towers into those bloody fields of practice 
where they unite with their allies and executors: the thugs. 

What, then, is the motive of such intellectuals? Power-lust. Power-lust — 
as a manifestation of helplessness, of self-loathing and of the desire for the 
unearned. 

The desire for the unearned has two aspects: the unearned in matter and 
the unearned in spirit. (By “spirit” I mean: man’s consciousness.) These two 
aspects are necessarily inter-related, but a man’s desire may be focused pre- 
dominantly on one or the other. The desire for the unearned in spirit is the 
more destructive of the two and the more corrupt. It is a desire for unearned 
greatness', it is expressed (but not defined) by the foggy murk of the term 
“prestige.” 

The seekers of unearned material benefits are merely financial parasites, 
moochers, looters or criminals, who are too limited in number and in mind to 
be a threat to civilization, until and unless they are released and legalized by 
the seekers of unearned greatness. 

Unearned greatness is so unreal, so neurotic a concept that the wretch who 
seeks it cannot identify it even to himself: to identify it, is to make it 
impossible. He needs the irrational, undefinable slogans of altruism and 
collectivism to give a semiplausible form to his nameless urge and anchor it 
to reality — to support his own self-deception more than to deceive his 
victims. “The public,” “the public interest,” “service to the public” are the 
means, the tools, the swinging pendulums of the power-luster’s self- 
hypnosis. 

Since there is no such entity as “the public,” since the public is merely a 
number of individuals, any claimed or implied conflict of “the public 
interest” with private interests means that the interests of some men are to be 
sacrificed to the interests and wishes of others. Since the concept is so 
conveniently undefinable, its use rests only on any given gang’s ability to 
proclaim that “The public, c ’est moi ” — and to maintain the claim at the point 
of a gun. 

No such claim has ever been or can ever be maintained without the help 
of a gun — that is, without physical force. But, on the other hand, without that 
claim, gunmen would remain where they belong: in the underworld, and 
would not rise to the councils of state to rule the destinies of nations. 

There are two ways of claiming that “The public, c’est moi”: one is 
practiced by the crude material parasite who clamors for government 
handouts in the name of a “public” need and pockets what he has not earned; 
the other is practiced by his leader, the spiritual parasite, who derives his 
illusion of “greatness” — like a fence receiving stolen goods — from the 


84 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


power to dispose of that which he has not earned and from the mystic view 
of himself as the embodied voice of “the public.” 

Of the two, the material parasite is psychologically healthier and closer to 
reality: at least, he eats or wears his loot. But the only source of satisfaction 
open to the spiritual parasite, his only means to gain “prestige” (apart from 
giving orders and spreading terror), is the most wasteful, useless and 
meaningless activity of all: the building of public monuments. 

Greatness is achieved by the productive effort of a man’s mind in the 
pursuit of clearly defined, rational goals. But a delusion of grandeur can be 
served only by the switching, undefinable chimera of a public monument — 
which is presented as a munificent gift to the victims whose forced labor or 
extorted money had paid for it — which is dedicated to the service of all and 
none, owned by all and none, gaped at by all and enjoyed by none. 

This is the ruler’s only way to appease his obsession: “prestige.” 
Prestige — in whose eyes? In anyone’s. In the eyes of his tortured victims, of 
the beggars in the streets of his kingdom, of the bootlickers at his court, of 
the foreign tribes and their rulers beyond the borders. It is to impress all 
those eyes — the eyes of everyone and no one — that the blood of generations 
of subjects has been spilled and spent. 

One may see, in certain biblical movies, a graphic image of the meaning 
of public monument building: the building of the pyramids. Hordes of 
starved, ragged, emaciated men straining the last effort of their inadequate 
muscles at the inhuman task of pulling the ropes that drag large chunks of 
stone, straining like tortured beasts of burden under the whips of overseers, 
collapsing on the job and dying in the desert sands — that a dead Pharaoh 
might lie in an imposingly senseless structure and thus gain eternal 
“prestige” in the eyes of the unborn of future generations. 

Temples and palaces are the only monuments left of mankind’s early 
civilizations. They were created by the same means and at the same price — a 
price not justified by the fact that primitive peoples undoubtedly believed, 
while dying of starvation and exhaustion, that the “prestige” of their tribe, 
their rulers or their gods was of value to them somehow. 

Rome fell, bankrupted by statist controls and taxation, while its emperors 
were building coliseums. Louis XIV of France taxed his people into a state 
of indigence, while he built the palace of Versailles, for his contemporary 
monarchs to envy and for modem tourists to visit. The marble-lined Moscow 
subway, built by the unpaid “volunteer” labor of Russian workers, including 
women, is a public monument, and so is the Czarist-like luxury of the 
champagne-and-caviar receptions at the Soviet embassies, which is 


85 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


needed — while the people stand in line for inadequate food rations — to 
“maintain the prestige of the Soviet Union.” 

The great distinction of the United States of America, up to the last few 
decades, was the modesty of its public monuments. Such monuments as did 
exist were genuine: they were not erected for “prestige,” but were functional 
structures that had housed events of great historical importance. If you have 
seen the austere simplicity of Independence Hall, you have seen the 
difference between authentic grandeur and the pyramids of “public-spirited” 
prestige-seekers. 

In America, human effort and material resources were not expropriated 
for public monuments and public projects, but were spent on the progress of 
the private, personal, individual well-being of individual citizens. America’s 
greatness lies in the fact that her actual monuments are not public. 

The skyline of New York is a monument of a splendor that no pyramids 
or palaces will ever equal or approach. But America’s skyscrapers were not 
built by public funds nor for a public purpose: they were built by the energy, 
initiative and wealth of private individuals for personal profit. And, instead 
of impoverishing the people, these skyscrapers, as they rose higher and 
higher, kept raising the people’s standard of living — including the 
inhabitants of the slums, who lead a life of luxury compared to the life of an 
ancient Egyptian slave or of a modern Soviet Socialist worker. 

Such is the difference — both in theory and practice — between capitalism 
and socialism. 

It is impossible to compute the human suffering, degradation, deprivation 
and horror that went to pay for a single, much-touted skyscraper of Moscow, 
or for the Soviet factories or mines or dams, or for any part of their loot-and- 
blood-supported “industrialization.” What we do know, however, is that 
forty-five years is a long time: it is the span of two generations; we do know 
that, in the name of a promised abundance, two generations of human beings 
have lived and died in subhuman poverty; and we do know that today’s 
advocates of socialism are not deterred by a fact of this kind. 

Whatever motive they might assert, benevolence is one they have long 
since lost the right to claim. 

The ideology of socialization (in a neo-fascist form) is now floating, by 
default, through the vacuum of our intellectual and cultural atmosphere. 
Observe how often we are asked for undefined “sacrifices” to unspecified 
purposes. Observe how often the present administration is invoking “the 
public interest.” Observe what prominence the issue of international prestige 
has suddenly acquired and what grotesquely suicidal policies are justified by 
references to matters of “prestige.” Observe that during the recent Cuban 


86 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


crisis — when the factual issue concerned nuclear missiles and nuclear war — 
our diplomats and commentators found it proper seriously to weigh such 
things as the “prestige,” the personal feelings and the “face-saving” of the 
sundry socialist rulers involved. 

There is no difference between the principles, policies and practical 
results of socialism — and those of any historical or prehistorical tyranny. 
Socialism is merely democratic absolute monarchy — that is, a system of 
absolutism without a fixed head, open to seizure of power by all comers, by 
any ruthless climber, opportunist, adventurer, demagogue or thug. 

When you consider socialism, do not fool yourself about its nature. 
Remember that there is no such dichotomy as “human rights” versus 
“property rights.” No human rights can exist without property rights. Since 
material goods are produced by the mind and effort of individual men, and 
are needed to sustain their lives, if the producer does not own the result of 
his effort, he does not own his life. To deny property rights means to turn 
men into property owned by the state. Whoever claims the “right” to 
“redistribute” the wealth produced by others is claiming the “right” to treat 
human beings as chattel. 

When you consider the global devastation perpetrated by socialism, the 
sea of blood and the millions of victims, remember that they were sacrificed, 
not for “the good of mankind” nor for any “noble ideal,” but for the festering 
vanity of some scared brute or some pretentious mediocrity who craved a 
mantle of unearned “greatness” — and that the monument to socialism is a 
pyramid of public factories, public theaters and public parks, erected on a 
foundation of human corpses, with the figure of the ruler posturing on top, 
beating his chest and screaming his plea for “prestige” to the starless void 
above him.

12. Man’s Rights 

by Ayn Rand 


If one wishes to advocate a free society — that is, capitalism — one must 
realize that its indispensable foundation is the principle of individual rights. 
If one wishes to uphold individual rights, one must realize that capitalism is 
the only system that can uphold and protect them. And if one wishes to 
gauge the relationship of freedom to the goals of today’s intellectuals, one 
may gauge it by the fact that the concept of individual rights is evaded, 
distorted, perverted and seldom discussed, most conspicuously seldom by 
the so-called “conservatives.” 

“Rights” are a moral concept — the concept that provides a logical 
transition from the principles guiding an individual’s actions to the 
principles guiding his relationship with others — the concept that preserves 
and protects individual morality in a social context — the link between the 
moral code of a man and the legal code of a society, between ethics and 
politics. Individual rights are the means of subordinating society to moral 
law. 

Every political system is based on some code of ethics. The dominant 
ethics of mankind’s history were variants of the altruist-collectivist doctrine 
which subordinated the individual to some higher authority, either mystical 
or social. Consequently, most political systems were variants of the same 
statist tyranny, differing only in degree, not in basic principle, limited only 
by the accidents of tradition, of chaos, of bloody strife and periodic collapse. 
Under all such systems, morality was a code applicable to the individual, but 
not to society. Society was placed outside the moral law, as its embodiment 
or source or exclusive interpreter — and the inculcation of self-sacrificial 
devotion to social duty was regarded as the main purpose of ethics in man’s 
earthly existence. 

Since there is no such entity as “society,” since society is only a number 
of individual men, this meant, in practice, that the rulers of society were 
exempt from moral law; subject only to traditional rituals, they held total 
power and exacted blind obedience — on the implicit principle of: “The good 
is that which is good for society (or for the tribe, the race, the nation), and 
the ruler’s edicts are its voice on earth.” 

This was true of all statist systems, under all variants of the altruist- 
collectivist ethics, mystical or social. “The Divine Right of Kings” 
summarizes the political theory of the first — ” Vox populi, vox dei ” of the 


88 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


second. As witness: the theocracy of Egypt, with the Pharaoh as an 
embodied god — the unlimited majority rule or democracy of Athens — the 
welfare state run by the Emperors of Rome — the Inquisition of the late 
Middle Ages — the absolute monarchy of France — the welfare state of 
Bismarck’s Prussia — the gas chambers of Nazi Germany — the 
slaughterhouse of the Soviet Union. 

All these political systems were expressions of the altruist-collectivist 
ethics — and their common characteristic is the fact that society stood above 
the moral law, as an omnipotent, sovereign whim worshiper. Thus, 
politically, all these systems were variants of an amoral society. 

The most profoundly revolutionary achievement of the United States of 
America was the subordination of society to moral law. 

The principle of man’s individual rights represented the extension of 
morality into the social system — as a limitation on the power of the state, as 
man’s protection against the brute force of the collective, as the 
subordination of might to right. The United States was the first moral 
society in history. 

All previous systems had regarded man as a sacrificial means to the ends 
of others, and society as an end in itself. The United States regarded man as 
an end in himself, and society as a means to the peaceful, orderly, voluntary 
coexistence of individuals. All previous systems had held that man’s life 
belongs to society, that society can dispose of him in any way it pleases, and 
that any freedom he enjoys is his only by favor, by the permission of society, 
which may be revoked at any time. The United States held that man’s life is 
his by right (which means: by moral principle and by his nature), that a right 
is the property of an individual, that society as such has no rights, and that 
the only moral purpose of a government is the protection of individual 
rights. 

A “right” is a moral principle defining and sanctioning a man’s freedom 
of action in a social context. There is only one fundamental right (all the 
others are its consequences or corollaries): a man’s right to his own life. Life 
is a process of self-sustaining and self-generated action; the right to life 
means the right to engage in self-sustaining and self-generated action — 
which means: the freedom to take all the actions required by the nature of a 
rational being for the support, the furtherance, the fulfillment and the 
enjoyment of his own life. (Such is the meaning of the right to life, liberty 
and the pursuit of happiness.) 

The concept of a “right” pertains only to action — specifically, to freedom 
of action. It means freedom from physical compulsion, coercion or 
interference by other men.

Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


Thus, for every individual, a right is the moral sanction of a positive — of 
his freedom to act on his own judgment, for his own goals, by his own 
voluntary, uncoerced choice. As to his neighbors, his rights impose no 
obligations on them except of a negative kind: to abstain from violating his 
rights. 

The right to life is the source of all rights — and the right to property is 
their only implementation. Without property rights, no other rights are 
possible. Since man has to sustain his life by his own effort, the man who 
has no right to the product of his effort has no means to sustain his life. The 
man who produces while others dispose of his product, is a slave. 

Bear in mind that the right to property is a right to action, like all the 
others: it is not the right to an object, but to the action and the consequences 
of producing or earning that object. It is not a guarantee that a man will earn 
any property, but only a guarantee that he will own it if he earns it. It is the 
right to gain, to keep, to use and to dispose of material values. 

The concept of individual rights is so new in human history that most men 
have not grasped it fully to this day. In accordance with the two theories of 
ethics, the mystical or the social, some men assert that rights are a gift of 
God — others, that rights are a gift of society. But, in fact, the source of rights 
is man’s nature. 

The Declaration of Independence stated that men “are endowed by their 
Creator with certain unalienable rights.” Whether one believes that man is 
the product of a Creator or of nature, the issue of man’s origin does not alter 
the fact that he is an entity of a specific kind — a rational being — that he 
cannot function successfully under coercion, and that rights are a necessary 
condition of his particular mode of survival. 

“The source of man’s rights is not divine law or congressional law, but the 
law of identity. A is A — and Man is Man. Rights are conditions of existence 
required by man’s nature for his proper survival. If man is to live on earth, it 
is right for him to use his mind, it is right to act on his own free judgment, it 
is right to work for his values and to keep the product of his work. If life on 
earth is his purpose, he has a right to live as a rational being: nature forbids 
him the irrational.” (Atlas Shrugged .) 

To violate man’s rights means to compel him to act against his own 
judgment, or to expropriate his values. Basically, there is only one way to do 
it: by the use of physical force. There are two potential violators of man’s 
rights: the criminals and the government. The great achievement of the 
United States was to draw a distinction between these two — by forbidding to 
the second the legalized version of the activities of the first. 


90 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


The Declaration of Independence laid down the principle that “to secure 
these rights, governments are instituted among men.” This provided the only 
valid justification of a government and defined its only proper purpose: to 
protect man’s rights by protecting him from physical violence. 

Thus the government’s function was changed from the role of ruler to the 
role of servant. The government was set to protect man from criminals — and 
the Constitution was written to protect man from the government. The Bill 
of Rights was not directed against private citizens, but against the 
government — as an explicit declaration that individual rights supersede any 
public or social power. 

The result was the pattern of a civilized society which — for the brief span 
of some hundred and fifty years — America came close to achieving. A 
civilized society is one in which physical force is banned from human 
relationships — in which the government, acting as a policeman, may use 
force only in retaliation and only against those who initiate its use. 

This was the essential meaning and intent of America’s political 
philosophy, implicit in the principle of individual rights. But it was not 
formulated explicitly, nor fully accepted nor consistently practiced. 

America’s inner contradiction was the altruist-collectivist ethics. Altruism 
is incompatible with freedom, with capitalism and with individual rights. 
One cannot combine the pursuit of happiness with the moral status of a 
sacrificial animal. 

It was the concept of individual rights that had given birth to a free 
society. It was with the destruction of individual rights that the destruction of 
freedom had to begin. 

A collectivist tyranny dare not enslave a country by an outright 
confiscation of its values, material or moral. It has to be done by a process of 
internal corruption. Just as in the material realm the plundering of a 
country’s wealth is accomplished by inflating the currency — so today one 
may witness the process of inflation being applied to the realm of rights. The 
process entails such a growth of newly promulgated “rights” that people do 
not notice the fact that the meaning of the concept is being reversed. Just as 
bad money drives out good money, so these “printing-press rights” negate 
authentic rights. 

Consider the curious fact that never has there been such a proliferation, all 
over the world, of two contradictory phenomena: of alleged new “rights” 
and of slave-labor camps. 

The “gimmick” was the switch of the concept of rights from the political 
to the economic realm. 


91 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


The Democratic Party platform of 1960 summarizes the switch boldly and 
explicitly. It declares that a Democratic Administration “will reaffirm the 
economic bill of rights which Franklin Roosevelt wrote into our national 
conscience sixteen years ago.” 

Bear clearly in mind the meaning of the concept of “ rights ” when you 
read the list which that platform offers: 

“1. The right to a useful and remunerative job in the industries or shops or 
farms or mines of the nation. 

“2. The right to earn enough to provide adequate food and clothing and 
recreation. 

“3. The right of every farmer to raise and sell his products at a return 
which will give him and his family a decent living. 

“4. The right of every businessman, large and small, to trade in an 
atmosphere of freedom from unfair competition and domination by 
monopolies at home and abroad. 

“5. The right of every family to a decent home. 

“6. The right to adequate medical care and the opportunity to achieve and 
enjoy good health. 

“7. The right to adequate protection from the economic fears of old age, 
sickness, accidents and unemployment. 

“8. The right to a good education.” 

A single question added to each of the above eight clauses would make 
the issue clear: At whose expense ? 

Jobs, food, clothing, recreation (!), homes, medical care, education, etc., 
do not grow in nature. These are man-made values — goods and services 
produced by men. Who is to provide them? 

If some men are entitled by right to the products of the work of others, it 
means that those others are deprived of rights and condemned to slave labor. 

Any alleged “right” of one man, which necessitates the violation of the 
rights of another, is not and cannot be a right. 

No man can have a right to impose an unchosen obligation, an 
unrewarded duty or an involuntary servitude on another man. There can be 
no such thing as “ the right to enslave .” 

A right does not include the material implementation of that right by other 
men; it includes only the freedom to earn that implementation by one’s own 
effort. 

Observe, in this context, the intellectual precision of the Founding 
Fathers: they spoke of the right to the pursuit of happiness — not of the right 
to happiness. It means that a man has the right to take the actions he deems 


92 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


necessary to achieve his happiness; it does not mean that others must make 
him happy. 

The right to life means that a man has the right to support his life by his 
own work (on any economic level, as high as his ability will carry him); it 
does not mean that others must provide him with the necessities of life. 

The right to property means that a man has the right to take the economic 
actions necessary to earn property, to use it and to dispose of it; it does not 
mean that others must provide him with property. 

The right of free speech means that a man has the right to express his 
ideas without danger of suppression, interference or punitive action by the 
government. It does not mean that others must provide him with a lecture 
hall, a radio station or a printing press through which to express his ideas. 

Any undertaking that involves more than one man, requires the voluntary 
consent of every participant. Every one of them has the right to make his 
own decision, but none has the right to force his decision on the others. 

There is no such thing as “a right to a job” — there is only the right of free 
trade, that is: a man’s right to take a job if another man chooses to hire him. 
There is no “right to a home,” only the right of free trade: the right to build a 
home or to buy it. There are no “rights to a ‘fair’ wage or a ‘fair’ price” if no 
one chooses to pay it, to hire a man or to buy his product. There are no 
“rights of consumers” to milk, shoes, movies or champagne if no producers 
choose to manufacture such items (there is only the right to manufacture 
them oneself). There are no “rights” of special groups, there are no “rights of 
farmers, of workers, of businessmen, of employees, of employers, of the old, 
of the young, of the unborn.” There are only the Rights of Man — rights 
possessed by every individual man and by all men as individuals. 

Property rights and the right of free trade are man’s only “economic 
rights” (they are, in fact, political rights) — and there can be no such thing as 
“an economic bill of rights.” But observe that the advocates of the latter have 
all but destroyed the former. 

Remember that rights are moral principles which define and protect a 
man’s freedom of action, but impose no obligations on other men. Private 
citizens are not a threat to one another’s rights or freedom. A private citizen 
who resorts to physical force and violates the rights of others is a criminal — 
and men have legal protection against him. 

Criminals are a small minority in any age or country. And the harm they 
have done to mankind is infinitesimal when compared to the horrors — the 
bloodshed, the wars, the persecutions, the confiscations, the famines, the 
enslavements, the wholesale destructions — perpetrated by mankind’s gov- 
ernments. Potentially, a government is the most dangerous threat to man’s 


93 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


rights: it holds a legal monopoly on the use of physical force against legally 
disarmed victims. When unlimited and unrestricted by individual rights, a 
government is men’s deadliest enemy. It is not as protection against private 
actions, but against governmental actions that the Bill of Rights was written. 

Now observe the process by which that protection is being destroyed. 

The process consists of ascribing to private citizens the specific violations 
constitutionally forbidden to the government (which private citizens have no 
power to commit) and thus freeing the government from all restrictions. The 
switch is becoming progressively more obvious in the field of free speech. 
For years, the collectivists have been propagating the notion that a private 
individual’s refusal to finance an opponent is a violation of the opponent’s 
right of free speech and an act of “censorship.” 

It is “censorship,” they claim, if a newspaper refuses to employ or publish 
writers whose ideas are diametrically opposed to its policy. 

It is “censorship,” they claim, if businessmen refuse to advertise in a 
magazine that denounces, insults and smears them. 

It is “censorship,” they claim, if a TV sponsor objects to some outrage 
perpetrated on a program he is financing — such as the incident of Alger Hiss 
being invited to denounce former Vice-President Nixon. 

And then there is Newton N. Minow who declares: “There is censorship 
by ratings, by advertisers, by networks, by affiliates which reject 
programming offered to their areas.” It is the same Mr. Minow who 
threatens to revoke the license of any station that does not comply with his 
views on programming — and who claims that that is not censorship. 

Consider the implications of such a trend. 

“Censorship” is a term pertaining only to governmental action. No private 
action is censorship. No private individual or agency can silence a man or 
suppress a publication; only the government can do so. The freedom of 
speech of private individuals includes the right not to agree, not to listen and 
not to finance one’s own antagonists. 

But according to such doctrines as the “economic bill of rights,” an 
individual has no right to dispose of his own material means by the guidance 
of his own convictions — and must hand over his money indiscriminately to 
any speakers or propagandists, who have a “right” to his property. 

This means that the ability to provide the material tools for the expression 
of ideas deprives a man of the right to hold any ideas. It means that a 
publisher has to publish books he considers worthless, false or evil — that a 
TV sponsor has to finance commentators who choose to affront his 
convictions — that the owner of a newspaper must turn his editorial pages 
over to any young hooligan who clamors for the enslavement of the press. It 


94 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


means that one group of men acquires the “right” to unlimited license — 
while another group is reduced to helpless irresponsibility. 

But since it is obviously impossible to provide every claimant with a job, 
a microphone or a newspaper column, who will determine the “distribution” 
of “economic rights” and select the recipients, when the owners’ right to 
choose has been abolished? Well, Mr. Minow has indicated that quite 
clearly. 

And if you make the mistake of thinking that this applies only to big 
property owners, you had better realize that the theory of “economic rights” 
includes the “right” of every would-be playwright, every beatnik poet, every 
noise-composer and every nonobjective artist (who have political pull) to the 
financial support you did not give them when you did not attend their shows. 
What else is the meaning of the project to spend your tax money on 
subsidized art? 

And while people are clamoring about “economic rights,” the concept of 
political rights is vanishing. It is forgotten that the right of free speech means 
the freedom to advocate one’s views and to bear the possible consequences, 
including disagreement with others, opposition, unpopularity and lack of 
support. The political function of “the right of free speech” is to protect 
dissenters and unpopular minorities from forcible suppression — not to 
guarantee them the support, advantages and rewards of a popularity they 
have not gained. 

The Bill of Rights reads: “Congress shall make no law ... abridging the 
freedom of speech, or of the press ...” It does not demand that private 
citizens provide a microphone for the man who advocates their destruction, 
or a passkey for the burglar who seeks to rob them, or a knife for the 
murderer who wants to cut their throats. 

Such is the state of one of today’s most crucial issues: political rights 
versus “ economic rights.” It’s either-or. One destroys the other. But there 
are, in fact, no “economic rights,” no “collective rights,” no “public-interest 
rights.” The term “individual rights” is a redundancy: there is no other kind 
of rights and no one else to possess them. 

Those who advocate laissez-faire capitalism are the only advocates of 
man’s rights.

13. Collectivized “Rights” 

by Ayn Rand 


Rights are a moral principle defining proper social relationships. Just as a 
man needs a moral code in order to survive (in order to act, to choose the 
right goals and to achieve them), so a society (a group of men) needs moral 
principles in order to organize a social system consonant with man’s nature 
and with the requirements of his survival. 

Just as a man can evade reality and act on the blind whim of any given 
moment, but can achieve nothing save progressive self-destruction — so a 
society can evade reality and establish a system ruled by the blind whims of 
its members or its leader, by the majority gang of any given moment, by the 
current demagogue or by a permanent dictator. But such a society can 
achieve nothing save the rule of brute force and a state of progressive self- 
destruction. 

What subjectivism is in the realm of ethics, collectivism is in the realm of 
politics. Just as the notion that “Anything I do is right because I chose to do 
it,” is not a moral principle, but a negation of morality — so the notion that 
“Anything society does is right because society chose to do it,” is not a 
moral principle, but a negation of moral principles and the banishment of 
morality from social issues. 

When “might” is opposed to “right,” the concept of “might” can have 
only one meaning: the power of brute, physical force — which, in fact, is not 
a “power” but the most hopeless state of impotence; it is merely the “power” 
to destroy; it is the “power” of a stampede of animals running amuck. 

Yet that is the goal of most of today’s intellectuals. At the root of all their 
conceptual switches, there lies another, more fundamental one: the switch of 
the concept of rights from the individual to the collective — which means: the 
replacement of “The Rights of Man” by “The Rights of Mob.” 

Since only an individual man can possess rights, the expression 
“individual rights” is a redundancy (which one has to use for purposes of 
clarification in today’s intellectual chaos). But the expression “collective 
rights” is a contradiction in terms. 

Any group or “collective,” large or small, is only a number of individuals. 
A group can have no rights other than the rights of its individual members. 
In a free society, the “rights” of any group are derived from the rights of its 
members through their voluntary, individual choice and contractual 
agreement, and are merely the application of these individual rights to a 


96 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


specific undertaking. Every legitimate group undertaking is based on the 
participants’ right of free association and free trade. (By “legitimate,” I 
mean: noncriminal and freely formed, that is, a group which no one was 
forced to join.) 

For instance, the right of an industrial concern to engage in business is 
derived from the right of its owners to invest their money in a productive 
venture — from their right to hire employees — from the right of the 
employees to sell their services — from the right of all those involved to pro- 
duce and to sell their products — from the right of the customers to buy (or 
not to buy) those products. Every link of this complex chain of contractual 
relationships rests on individual rights, individual choices, individual 
agreements. Every agreement is delimited, specified and subject to certain 
conditions, that is, dependent upon a mutual trade to mutual benefit. 

This is true of all legitimate groups or associations in a free society: 
partnerships, business concerns, professional associations, labor unions 
( voluntary ones), political parties, etc. It applies also to all agency 
agreements: the right of one man to act for or represent another or others is 
derived from the rights of those he represents and is delegated to him by 
their voluntary choice, for a specific, delimited purpose — as in the case of a 
lawyer, a business representative, a labor union delegate, etc. 

A group, as such, has no rights. A man can neither acquire new rights by 
joining a group nor lose the rights which he does possess. The principle of 
individual rights is the only moral base of all groups or associations. 

Any group that does not recognize this principle is not an association, but 
a gang or a mob. 

Any doctrine of group activities that does not recognize individual rights 
is a doctrine of mob rule or legalized lynching. 

The notion of “collective rights” (the notion that rights belong to groups, 
not to individuals) means that “rights” belong to some men, but not to 
others — that some men have the “right” to dispose of others in any manner 
they please — and that the criterion of such privileged position consists of 
numerical superiority. 

Nothing can ever justify or validate such a doctrine — and no one ever has. 
Like the altruist morality from which it is derived, this doctrine rests on 
mysticism: either on the old-fashioned mysticism of faith in supernatural 
edicts, like “The Divine Right of Kings” — or on the social mystique of 
modem collectivists who see society as a super-organism, as some 
supernatural entity apart from and superior to the sum of its individual 
members. 


97 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


The amorality of that collectivist mystique is particularly obvious today in 
the issue of national rights. 

A nation, like any other group, is only a number of individuals and can 
have no rights other than the rights of its individual citizens. A free nation — 
a nation that recognizes, respects and protects the individual rights of its 
citizens — has a right to its territorial integrity, its social system and its form 
of government. The government of such a nation is not the ruler, but the 
servant or agent of its citizens and has no rights other than the rights 
delegated to it by the citizens for a specific, delimited task (the task of 
protecting them from physical force, derived from their right of self- 
defense). 

The citizens of a free nation may disagree about the specific legal 
procedures or methods of implementing their rights (which is a complex 
problem, the province of political science and of the philosophy of law), but 
they agree on the basic principle to be implemented: the principle of 
individual rights. When a country’s constitution places individual rights 
outside the reach of public authorities, the sphere of political power is 
severely delimited — and thus the citizens may, safely and properly, agree to 
abide by the decisions of a majority vote in this delimited sphere. The lives 
and property of minorities or dissenters are not at stake, are not subject to 
vote and are not endangered by any majority decision; no man or group 
holds a blank check on power over others. 

Such a nation has a right to its sovereignty (derived from the rights of its 
citizens) and a right to demand that its sovereignty be respected by all other 
nations. 

But this right cannot be claimed by dictatorships, by savage tribes or by 
any form of absolutist tyranny. A nation that violates the rights of its own 
citizens cannot claim any rights whatsoever. In the issue of rights, as in all 
moral issues, there can be no double standard. A nation ruled by brute 
physical force is not a nation, but a horde — whether it is led by Attila, 
Genghis Khan, Hitler, Khrushchev or Castro. What rights could Attila claim 
and on what grounds? 

This applies to all forms of tribal savagery, ancient or modem, primitive 
or “industrialized.” Neither geography nor race nor tradition nor previous 
state of development can confer on some human beings the “right” to violate 
the rights of others. 

The right of “the self-determination of nations” applies only to free 
societies or to societies seeking to establish freedom; it does not apply to 
dictatorships. Just as an individual’s right of free action does not include the 
“right” to commit crimes (that is, to violate the rights of others), so the right 


98 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


of a nation to determine its own form of government does not include the 
right to establish a slave society (that is, to legalize the enslavement of some 
men by others). There is no such thing as “ the right to enslave .” A nation 
can do it, just as a man can become a criminal — but neither can do it by 
right. 

It does not matter, in this context, whether a nation was enslaved by force, 
like Soviet Russia, or by vote, like Nazi Germany. Individual rights are not 
subject to a public vote; a majority has no right to vote away the rights of a 
minority; the political function of rights is precisely to protect minorities 
from oppression by majorities (and the smallest minority on earth is the 
individual). Whether a slave society was conquered or chose to be enslaved, 
it can claim no national rights and no recognition of such “rights” by 
civilized countries — just as a mob of gangsters cannot demand a recognition 
of its “rights” and a legal equality with an industrial concern or a university, 
on the ground that the gangsters chose by unanimous vote to engage in that 
particular kind of group activity. 

Dictatorship nations are outlaws. Any free nation had the right to invade 
Nazi Germany and, today, has the right to invade Soviet Russia, Cuba or any 
other slave pen. Whether a free nation chooses to do so or not is a matter of 
its own self-interest, not of respect for the nonexistent “rights” of gang 
rulers. It is not a free nation’s duty to liberate other nations at the price of 
self-sacrifice, but a free nation has the right to do it, when and if it so 
chooses. 

This right, however, is conditional. Just as the suppression of crimes does 
not give a policeman the right to engage in criminal activities, so the 
invasion and destruction of a dictatorship does not give the invader the right 
to establish another variant of a slave society in the conquered country. 

A slave country has no national rights, but the individual rights of its 
citizens remain valid, even if unrecognized, and the conqueror has no right 
to violate them. Therefore, the invasion of an enslaved country is morally 
justified only when and if the conquerors establish a free social system, that 
is, a system based on the recognition of individual rights. 

Since there is no fully free country today, since the so-called “Free 
World” consists of various “mixed economies,” it might be asked whether 
every country on earth is morally open to invasion by every other. The 
answer is: No. There is a difference between a country that recognizes the 
principle of individual rights, but does not implement it fully in practice, and 
a country that denies and flouts it explicitly. All “mixed economies” are in a 
precarious state of transition which, ultimately, has to turn to freedom or 
collapse into dictatorship. There are four characteristics which brand a 


99 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


country unmistakably as a dictatorship: one-party rule — executions without 
trial or with a mock trial, for political offenses — the nationalization or 
expropriation of private property — and censorship. A country guilty of these 
outrages forfeits any moral prerogatives, any claim to national rights or 
sovereignty, and becomes an outlaw. 

Observe, on this particular issue, the shameful end-of-trail and the 
intellectual disintegration of modern “liberals.” 

Internationalism had always been one of the “liberals’ ” basic tenets. They 
regarded nationalism as a major social evil, as a product of capitalism and as 
the cause of wars. They opposed any form of national self-interest; they re- 
fused to differentiate between rational patriotism and blind, racist 
chauvinism, denouncing both as “fascist.” They advocated the dissolution of 
national boundaries and the merging of all nations into “One World.” Next 
to property rights, “national rights” were the special target of their attacks. 

Today, it is “national rights” that they invoke as their last, feeble, fading 
hold on some sort of moral justification for the results of their theories — for 
the brood of little statist dictatorships spreading, like a skin disease, over the 
surface of the globe, in the form of so-called “newly emerging nations,” 
semi-socialist, semi-communist, semi-fascist, and wholly committed only to 
the use of brute force. 

It is the “national right” of such countries to choose their own form of 
government (any form they please) that the “liberals” offer as a moral 
validation and ask us to respect. It is the “national right” of Cuba to its form 
of government, they claim, that we must not violate or interfere with. Having 
all but destroyed the legitimate national rights of free countries, it is for 
dictatorships that the “liberals” now claim the sanction of “national rights.” 

And worse: it is not mere nationalism that the “liberals” champion, but 
racism — primordial tribal racism. 

Observe the double standard: while, in the civilized countries of the West, 
the “liberals” are still advocating internationalism and global self-sacrifice — 
the savage tribes of Asia and Africa are granted the sovereign “right” to 
slaughter one another in racial warfare. Mankind is reverting to a pre- 
industrial, prehistorical view of society: to racial collectivism. 

Such is the logical result and climax of the “liberals’ ” moral collapse 
which began when, as a prelude to the collectivization of property, they 
accepted the collectivization of rights. 

Their own confession of guilt lies in their terminology. Why do they use 
the word “ rights ” to denote the things they are advocating? Why don’t they 
preach what they practice? Why don’t they name it openly and attempt to 
justify it, if they can?

14. The Nature of Government 

by Ayn Rand 


A government is an institution that holds the exclusive power to enforce 
certain rules of social conduct in a given geographical area. 

Do men need such an institution — and why? 

Since man’s mind is his basic tool of survival, his means of gaining 
knowledge to guide his actions — the basic condition he requires is the 
freedom to think and to act according to his rational judgment. This does not 
mean that a man must live alone and that a desert island is the environment 
best suited to his needs. Men can derive enormous benefits from dealing 
with one another. A social environment is most conducive to their successful 
survival — but only on certain conditions. 

“The two great values to be gained from social existence are: knowledge 
and trade. Man is the only species that can transmit and expand his store of 
knowledge from generation to generation; the knowledge potentially 
available to man is greater than any one man could begin to acquire in his 
own lifespan; every man gains an incalculable benefit from the knowledge 
discovered by others. The second great benefit is the division of labor: it 
enables a man to devote his effort to a particular field of work and to trade 
with others who specialize in other fields. This form of cooperation allows 
all men who take part in it to achieve a greater knowledge, skill and 
productive return on their effort than they could achieve if each had to 
produce everything he needs, on a desert island or on a self-sustaining farm. 

“But these very benefits indicate, delimit and define what kind of men can 
be of value to one another and in what kind of society: only rational, 
productive, independent men in a rational, productive, free society.” (“The 
Objectivist Ethics.”) 

A society that robs an individual of the product of his effort, or enslaves 
him, or attempts to limit the freedom of his mind, or compels him to act 
against his own rational judgment — a society that sets up a conflict between 
its edicts and the requirements of man’s nature — is not, strictly speaking, a 
society, but a mob held together by institutionalized gang-rule. Such a 
society destroys all the values of human coexistence, has no possible 
justification and represents, not a source of benefits, but the deadliest threat 
to man’s survival. Life on a desert island is safer than and incomparably 
preferable to existence in Soviet Russia or Nazi Germany.

If men are to live together in a peaceful, productive, rational society and 
deal with one another to mutual benefit, they must accept the basic social 
principle without which no moral or civilized society is possible: the 
principle of individual rights. (See Chapters 12 and 13.) 

To recognize individual rights means to recognize and accept the 
conditions required by man’s nature for his proper survival. 

Man’s rights can be violated only by the use of physical force. It is only 
by means of physical force that one man can deprive another of his life, or 
enslave him, or rob him, or prevent him from pursuing his own goals, or 
compel him to act against his own rational judgment. 

The precondition of a civilized society is the barring of physical force 
from social relationships — thus establishing the principle that if men wish to 
deal with one another, they may do so only by means of reason : by 
discussion, persuasion and voluntary, uncoerced agreement. 

The necessary consequence of man’s right to life is his right to self- 
defense. In a civilized society, force may be used only in retaliation and only 
against those who initiate its use. All the reasons which make the initiation 
of physical force an evil, make the retaliatory use of physical force a moral 
imperative. 

If some “pacifist” society renounced the retaliatory use of force, it would 
be left helplessly at the mercy of the first thug who decided to be immoral. 
Such a society would achieve the opposite of its intention: instead of 
abolishing evil, it would encourage and reward it. 

If a society provided no organized protection against force, it would 
compel every citizen to go about armed, to turn his home into a fortress, to 
shoot any strangers approaching his door — or to join a protective gang of 
citizens who would fight other gangs, formed for the same purpose, and thus 
bring about the degeneration of that society into the chaos of gang-rule, i.e., 
rule by brute force, into perpetual tribal warfare of prehistorical savages. 

The use of physical force — even its retaliatory use — cannot be left at the 
discretion of individual citizens. Peaceful coexistence is impossible if a man 
has to live under the constant threat of force to be unleashed against him by 
any of his neighbors at any moment. Whether his neighbors’ intentions are 
good or bad, whether their judgment is rational or irrational, whether they 
are motivated by a sense of justice or by ignorance or by prejudice or by 
malice — the use of force against one man cannot be left to the arbitrary 
decision of another. 

Visualize, for example, what would happen if a man missed his wallet, 
concluded that he had been robbed, broke into every house in the 


103 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


neighborhood to search it, and shot the first man who gave him a dirty look, 
taking the look to be a proof of guilt. 

The retaliatory use of force requires objective rules of evidence to 
establish that a crime has been committed and to prove who committed it, as 
well as objective rules to define punishments and enforcement procedures. 
Men who attempt to prosecute crimes, without such rules, are a lynch mob. 
If a society left the retaliatory use of force in the hands of individual citizens, 
it would degenerate into mob rule, lynch law and an endless series of bloody 
private feuds or vendettas. 

If physical force is to be barred from social relationships, men need an 
institution charged with the task of protecting their rights under an objective 
code of rules. 

This is the task of a government — of a proper government — its basic task, 
is only moral justification and the reason why men do need a government. 

A government is the means of placing the retaliatory use of physical force 
under objective control — i.e., under objectively defined laws. 

The fundamental difference between private action and governmental 
action — a difference thoroughly ignored and evaded today — lies in the fact 
that a government holds a monopoly on the legal use of physical force. It has 
to hold such a monopoly, since it is the agent of restraining and combating 
the use of force; and for that very same reason, its actions have to be rigidly 
defined, delimited and circumscribed; no touch of whim or caprice should be 
permitted in its performance; it should be an impersonal robot, with the laws 
as its only motive power. If a society is to be free, its government has to be 
controlled. 

Under a proper social system, a private individual is legally free to take 
any action he pleases (so long as he does not violate the rights of others), 
while a government official is bound by law in his every official act. A 
private individual may do anything except that which is legally forbidden', a 
government official may do nothing except that which is legally permitted. 

This is the means of subordinating “might” to “right.” This is the 
American concept of “a government of laws and not of men.” 

The nature of the laws proper to a free society and the source of its 
government’s authority are both to be derived from the nature and purpose 
of a proper government. The basic principle of both is indicated in The 
Declaration of Independence: “to secure these [individual] rights, govern- 
ments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent 
of the governed ...” 

Since the protection of individual rights is the only proper purpose of a 
government, it is the only proper subject of legislation: all laws must be 


104 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


based on individual rights and aimed at their protection. All laws must be 
objective (and objectively justifiable): men must know clearly, and in ad- 
vance of taking an action, what the law forbids them to do (and why), what 
constitutes a crime and what penalty they will incur if they commit it. 

The source of the government’s authority is “the consent of the 
governed.” This means that the government is not the ruler, but the servant 
or agent of the citizens; it means that the government as such has no rights 
except the rights delegated to it by the citizens for a specific purpose. 

There is only one basic principle to which an individual must consent if 
he wishes to live in a free, civilized society: the principle of renouncing the 
use of physical force and delegating to the government his right of physical 
self-defense, for the purpose of an orderly, objective, legally defined en- 
forcement. Or, to put it another way, he must accept the separation of force 
and whim (any whim, including his own). 

Now what happens in case of a disagreement between two men about an 
undertaking in which both are involved? 

In a free society, men are not forced to deal with one another. They do so 
only by voluntary agreement and, when a time element is involved, by 
contract. If a contract is broken by the arbitrary decision of one man, it may 
cause a disastrous financial injury to the other — and the victim would have 
no recourse except to seize the offender’s property as compensation. But 
here again, the use of force cannot be left to the decision of private 
individuals. And this leads to one of the most important and most complex 
functions of the government: to the function of an arbiter who settles 
disputes among men according to objective laws. 

Criminals are a small minority in any semicivilized society. But the 
protection and enforcement of contracts through courts of civil law is the 
most crucial need of a peaceful society; without such protection, no 
civilization could be developed or maintained. 

Man cannot survive, as animals do, by acting on the range of the 
immediate moment. Man has to project his goals and achieve them across a 
span of time; he has to calculate his actions and plan his life long-range. The 
better a man’s mind and the greater his knowledge, the longer the range of 
his planning. The higher or more complex a civilization, the longer the range 
of activity it requires — and, therefore, the longer the range of contractual 
agreements among men, and the more urgent their need of protection for the 
security of such agreements. 

Even a primitive barter society could not function if a man agreed to trade 
a bushel of potatoes for a basket of eggs and, having received the eggs, 
refused to deliver the potatoes. Visualize what this sort of whim-directed 


105 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


action would mean in an industrial society where men deliver a billion 
dollars’ worth of goods on credit, or contract to build multimillion-dollar 
structures, or sign ninety-nine-year leases. 

A unilateral breach of contract involves an indirect use of physical force: 
it consists, in essence, of one man receiving the material values, goods or 
services of another, then refusing to pay for them and thus keeping them by 
force (by mere physical possession), not by right — i.e., keeping them 
without the consent of their owner. Fraud involves a similarly indirect use of 
force: it consists of obtaining material values without their owner’s consent, 
under false pretenses or false promises. Extortion is another variant of an 
indirect use of force: it consists of obtaining material values, not in exchange 
for values, but by the threat of force, violence or injury. 

Some of these actions are obviously criminal. Others, such as a unilateral 
breach of contract, may not be criminally motivated, but may be caused by 
irresponsibility and irrationality. Still others may be complex issues with 
some claim to justice on both sides. But whatever the case may be, all such 
issues have to be made subject to objectively defined laws and have to be 
resolved by an impartial arbiter, administering the laws, i.e., by a judge (and 
a jury, when appropriate). 

Observe the basic principle governing justice in all these cases: it is the 
principle that no man may obtain any values from others without the 
owners’ consent — and, as a corollary, that a man’s rights may not be left at 
the mercy of the unilateral decision, the arbitrary choice, the irrationality, the 
whim of another man. 

Such, in essence, is the proper purpose of a government: to make social 
existence possible to men, by protecting the benefits and combating the evils 
which men can cause to one another. 

The proper functions of a government fall into three broad categories, all 
of them involving the issues of physical force and the protection of men’s 
rights: the police, to protect men from criminals — the armed services, to 
protect men from foreign invaders — the law courts, to settle disputes among 
men according to objective laws. 

These three categories involve many corollary and derivative issues — and 
their implementation in practice, in the form of specific legislation, is 
enormously complex. It belongs to the field of a special science: the 
philosophy of law. Many errors and many disagreements are possible in the 
field of implementation, but what is essential here is the principle to be 
implemented: the principle that the purpose of law and of government is the 
protection of individual rights. 


106 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


Today, this principle is forgotten, ignored and evaded. The result is the 
present state of the world, with mankind’s retrogression to the lawlessness of 
absolutist tyranny, to the primitive savagery of rule by brute force. 

In unthinking protest against this trend, some people are raising the 
question of whether government as such is evil by nature and whether 
anarchy is the ideal social system. Anarchy, as a political concept, is a naive 
floating abstraction: for all the reasons discussed above, a society without an 
organized government would be at the mercy of the first criminal who came 
along and who would precipitate it into the chaos of gang warfare. But the 
possibility of human immorality is not the only objection to anarchy: even a 
society whose every member were fully rational and faultlessly moral, could 
not function in a state of anarchy; it is the need of objective laws and of an 
arbiter for honest disagreements among men that necessitates the 
establishment of a government. 

A recent variant of anarchistic theory, which is befuddling some of the 
younger advocates of freedom, is a weird absurdity called “competing 
governments.” Accepting the basic premise of the modern statists — who see 
no difference between the functions of government and the functions of in- 
dustry, between force and production, and who advocate government 
ownership of business — the proponents of “competing governments” take 
the other side of the same coin and declare that since competition is so 
beneficial to business, it should also be applied to government. Instead of a 
single, monopolistic government, they declare, there should be a number of 
different governments in the same geographical area, competing for the 
allegiance of individual citizens, with every citizen free to “shop” and to 
patronize whatever government he chooses. 

Remember that forcible restraint of men is the only service a government 
has to offer. Ask yourself what a competition in forcible restraint would 
have to mean. 

One cannot call this theory a contradiction in terms, since it is obviously 
devoid of any understanding of the terms “competition” and “government.” 
Nor can one call it a floating abstraction, since it is devoid of any contact 
with or reference to reality and cannot be concretized at all, not even roughly 
or approximately. One illustration will be sufficient: suppose Mr. Smith, a 
customer of Government A, suspects that his next-door neighbor, Mr. Jones, 
a customer of Government B, has robbed him; a squad of Police A proceeds 
to Mr. Jones’ house and is met at the door by a squad of Police B, who 
declare that they do not accept the validity of Mr. Smith’s complaint and do 
not recognize the authority of Government A. What happens then? You take 
it from there.

Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


The evolution of the concept of “government” has had a long, tortuous 
history. Some glimmer of the government’s proper function seems to have 
existed in every organized society, manifesting itself in such phenomena as 
the recognition of some implicit (if often nonexistent) difference between a 
government and a robber gang — the aura of respect and of moral authority 
granted to the government as the guardian of “law and order” — the fact that 
even the most evil types of government found it necessary to maintain some 
semblance of order and some pretense at justice, if only by routine and 
tradition, and to claim some sort of moral justification for their power, of a 
mystical or social nature. Just as the absolute monarchs of France had to in- 
voke “The Divine Right of Kings,” so the modem dictators of Soviet Russia 
have to spend fortunes on propaganda to justify their mle in the eyes of their 
enslaved subjects. 

In mankind’s history, the understanding of the government’s proper 
function is a very recent achievement: it is only two hundred years old and it 
dates from the Founding Fathers of the American Revolution. Not only did 
they identify the nature and the needs of a free society, but they devised the 
means to translate it into practice. A free society — like any other human 
product — cannot be achieved by random means, by mere wishing or by the 
leaders’ “good intentions.” A complex legal system, based on objectively 
valid principles, is required to make a society free and to keep it free — a 
system that does not depend on the motives, the moral character or the 
intentions of any given official, a system that leaves no opportunity, no legal 
loophole for the development of tyranny. 

The American system of checks and balances was just such an 
achievement. And although certain contradictions in the Constitution did 
leave a loophole for the growth of statism, the incomparable achievement 
was the concept of a constitution as a means of limiting and restricting the 
power of the government. 

Today, when a concerted effort is made to obliterate this point, it cannot 
be repeated too often that the Constitution is a limitation on the government, 
not on private individuals — that it does not prescribe the conduct of private 
individuals, only the conduct of the government — that it is not a charter for 
government power, but a charter of the citizens’ protection against the 
government. 

Now consider the extent of the moral and political inversion in today’s 
prevalent view of government. Instead of being a protector of man’s rights, 
the government is becoming their most dangerous violator; instead of 
guarding freedom, the government is establishing slavery; instead of 
protecting men from the initiators of physical force, the government is 


108 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


initiating physical force and coercion in any manner and issue it pleases; 
instead of serving as the instrument of objectivity in human relationships, the 
government is creating a deadly, subterranean reign of uncertainty and fear, 
by means of nonobjective laws whose interpretation is left to the arbitrary 
decisions of random bureaucrats; instead of protecting men from injury by 
whim, the government is arrogating to itself the power of unlimited whim — 
so that we are fast approaching the stage of the ultimate inversion: the stage 
where the government is free to do anything it pleases, while the citizens 
may act only by permission', which is the stage of the darkest periods of 
human history, the stage of rule by brute force. 

It has often been remarked that in spite of its material progress, mankind 
has not achieved any comparable degree of moral progress. That remark is 
usually followed by some pessimistic conclusion about human nature. It is 
true that the moral state of mankind is disgracefully low. But if one 
considers the monstrous moral inversions of the governments (made possible 
by the altruist-collectivist morality) under which mankind has had to live 
through most of its history, one begins to wonder how men have managed to 
preserve even a semblance of civilization, and what indestructible vestige of 
self-esteem has kept them walking upright on two feet. 

One also begins to see more clearly the nature of the political principles 
that have to be accepted and advocated, as part of the battle for man’s 
intellectual Renaissance.

15. Government Financing in a Free 
Society 

by Ayn Rand 


“What would be the proper method of financing the government in a fully 
free society?” 

This question is usually asked in connection with the Objectivist principle 
that the government of a free society may not initiate the use of physical 
force and may use force only in retaliation against those who initiate its use. 
Since the imposition of taxes does represent an initiation of force, how, it is 
asked, would the government of a free country raise the money needed to 
finance its proper services? 

In a fully free society, taxation — or, to be exact, payment for 
governmental services — would be voluntary. Since the proper services of a 
government — the police, the armed forces, the law courts — are 
demonstrably needed by individual citizens and affect their interests directly, 
the citizens would (and should) be willing to pay for such services, as they 
pay for insurance. 

The question of how to implement the principle of voluntary government 
financing — how to determine the best means of applying it in practice — is a 
very complex one and belongs to the field of the philosophy of law. The task 
of political philosophy is only to establish the nature of the principle and to 
demonstrate that it is practicable. The choice of a specific method of 
implementation is more than premature today — since the principle will be 
practicable only in a fully free society, a society whose government has been 
constitutionally reduced to its proper, basic functions. (For a discussion of 
these functions, see Chapter 14.) 

There are many possible methods of voluntary government financing. A 
government lottery, which has been used in some European countries, is one 
such method. There are others. 

As an illustration (and only as an illustration), consider the following 
possibility. One of the most vitally needed services, which only a 
government can render, is the protection of contractual agreements among 
citizens. Suppose that the government were to protect — i.e., to recognize as 
legally valid and enforceable — only those contracts which had been insured 
by the payment, to the government, of a premium in the amount of a legally 
fixed percentage of the sums involved in the contractual transaction. Such an 
insurance would not be compulsory; there would be no legal penalty 


110 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


imposed on those who did not choose to take it — they would be free to make 
verbal agreements or to sign uninsured contracts, if they so wished. The only 
consequence would be that such agreements or contracts would not be 
legally enforceable; if they were broken, the injured party would not be able 
to seek redress in a court of law. 

All credit transactions are contractual agreements. A credit transaction is 
any exchange which involves a passage of time between the payment and 
the receipt of goods or services. This includes the vast majority of economic 
transactions in a complex industrial society. Only a very small part of the 
gigantic network of credit transactions ever ends up in court, but the entire 
network is made possible by the existence of the courts, and would collapse 
overnight without that protection. This is a government service which people 
need, use, rely upon and should pay for. Yet, today, this service is provided 
gratuitously and amounts, in effect, to a subsidy. 

When one considers the magnitude of the wealth involved in credit 
transactions, one can see that the percentage required to pay for such 
governmental insurance would be infinitesimal — much smaller than that 
paid for other types of insurance — yet it would be sufficient to finance all 
the other functions of a proper government. (If necessary, that percentage 
could be legally increased in time of war; or other, but similar, methods of 
raising money could be established for clearly defined wartime needs.) 

This particular “plan” is mentioned here only as an illustration of a 
possible method of approach to the problem — not as a definitive answer nor 
as a program to advocate at present. The legal and technical difficulties 
involved are enormous: they include such questions as the need of an 
ironclad constitutional provision to prevent the government from dictating 
the content of private contracts (an issue which exists today and needs much 
more objective definitions) — the need of objective standards (or safeguards) 
for establishing the amount of the premiums, which cannot be left to the 
arbitrary discretion of the government, etc. 

Any program of voluntary government financing is the last, not the first, 
step on the road to a free society — the last, not the first, reform to advocate. 
It would work only when the basic principles and institutions of a free 
society have been established. It would not work today. 

Men would pay voluntarily for insurance protecting their contracts. But 
they would not pay voluntarily for insurance against the danger of 
aggression by Cambodia. Nor would the plywood manufacturers of 
Wisconsin and their workers pay voluntarily for insurance to assist the 
development of the plywood industry of Japan which would put them out of 
business.

A program of voluntary government financing would be amply sufficient 
to pay for the legitimate functions of a proper government. It would not be 
sufficient to provide unearned support for the entire globe. But no type of 
taxation is sufficient for that — only the suicide of a great country might be 
and then only temporarily. 

Just as the growth of controls, taxes and “government obligations” in this 
country was not accomplished overnight — so the process of liberation 
cannot be accomplished overnight. A process of liberation would be much 
more rapid than the process of enslavement had been, since the facts of 
reality would be its ally. But still, a gradual process is required — and any 
program of voluntary government financing has to be regarded as a goal for 
a distant future. 

What the advocates of a fully free society have to know, at present, is only 
the principle by which that goal can be achieved. 

The principle of voluntary government financing rests on the following 
premises: that the government is not the owner of the citizens’ income and, 
therefore, cannot hold a blank check on that income — that the nature of the 
proper governmental services must be constitutionally defined and 
delimited, leaving the government no power to enlarge the scope of its 
services at its own arbitrary discretion. Consequently, the principle of 
voluntary government financing regards the government as the servant, not 
the ruler, of the citizens — as an agent who must be paid for his services, not 
as a benefactor whose services are gratuitous, who dispenses something for 
nothing. 

This last, along with the notion of compulsory taxation, is a remnant of 
the time when the government was regarded as the omnipotent ruler of the 
citizens. An absolute monarch, who owned the work, income, property and 
lives of his subjects, had to be an unpaid “benefactor,” protector and 
dispenser of favors. Such a monarch would have considered it demeaning to 
be paid for his services — just as the atavistic mentalities of his descendants- 
in-spirit (the remnants of Europe’s ancient feudal aristocracy, and the mod- 
ern welfare statists) still consider an earned, commercial income as 
demeaning and as morally inferior to an unearned one which is acquired by 
mooching or looting, by charitable donations or governmental force. 

When a government, be it a monarch or a “democratic” parliament, is 
regarded as a provider of gratuitous services, it is only a question of time 
before it begins to enlarge its services and the sphere of the gratuitous 
(today, this process is called the growth of “the public sector of the 
economy”) until it becomes, and has to become, the instrument of pressure- 
group warfare — of economic groups looting one another. 


112 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


The premise to check (and to challenge) in this context is the primordial 
notion that any governmental services (even the legitimate ones) should be 
given to the citizens gratuitously. In order fully to translate into practice the 
American concept of the government as a servant of the citizens, one has to 
regard the government as a paid servant. Then, on that basis, one can 
proceed to devise the appropriate means of tying government revenues 
directly to the government services rendered. 

It may be observed, in the example given above, that the cost of such 
voluntary government financing would be automatically proportionate to the 
scale of an individual’s economic activity; those on the lowest economic 
levels (who seldom, if ever, engage in credit transactions) would be virtually 
exempt — though they would still enjoy the benefits of legal protection, such 
as that offered by the armed forces, by the police and by the courts dealing 
with criminal offenses. These benefits may be regarded as a bonus to the 
men of lesser economic ability, made possible by the men of greater 
economic ability — without any sacrifice of the latter to the former. 

It is in their own interests that the men of greater ability have to pay for 
the maintenance of armed forces, for the protection of their country against 
invasion; their expenses are not increased by the fact that a marginal part of 
the population is unable to contribute to these costs. Economically, that 
marginal group is nonexistent as far as the costs of war are concerned. The 
same is true of the costs of maintaining a police force: it is in their own 
interests that the abler men have to pay for the apprehension of criminals, 
regardless of whether the specific victim of a given crime is rich or poor. 

It is important to note that this type of free protection for the 
noncontributors represents an indirect benefit and is merely a marginal 
consequence of the contributors’ own interests and expenses. This type of 
bonus cannot be stretched to cover direct benefits, or to claim — as the wel- 
fare statists are claiming — that direct handouts to the non-producers are in 
the producers’ own interests. 

The difference, briefly, is as follows: if a railroad were running a train and 
allowed the poor to ride without payment in the seats left empty, it would 
not be the same thing (nor the same principle) as providing the poor with 
first-class carriages and special trains. 

Any type of nonsacrificial assistance, of social bonus, gratuitous benefit 
or gift value possible among men, is possible only in a free society, and is 
proper so long as it is nonsacrificial. But, in a free society, under a system of 
voluntary government financing, there would be no legal loophole, no legal 
possibility, for any “redistribution of wealth” — for the unearned support of 
some men by the forced labor and extorted income of others — for the 


113

draining, exploitation and destruction of those who are able to pay the costs 
of maintaining a civilized society, in favor of those who are unable or 
unwilling to pay the cost of maintaining their own existence.

16. The Divine Right of Stagnation 

by Nathaniel Branden 


For every living species, growth is a necessity of survival. Life is motion, a 
process of self-sustaining action that an organism must carry on in order to 
remain in existence. This principle is equally evident in the simple energy- 
conversions of a plant and in the long-range, complex activities of man. 
Biologically, inactivity is death. 

The nature and range of possible motion and development varies from 
species to species. The range of a plant’s action and development is far less 
than an animal’s; an animal’s is far less than man’s. An animal’s capacity 
for development ends at physical maturity and thereafter its growth consists 
of the action necessary to maintain itself at a fixed level; after reaching 
maturity, it does not, to any significant extent, continue to grow in efficacy — 
that is, it does not significantly increase its ability to cope with the environ- 
ment. But man’s capacity for development does not end at physical maturity; 
his capacity is virtually limitless. His power to reason is man’s 
distinguishing characteristic, his mind is man’s basic means of survival — 
and his ability to think, to learn, to discover new and better ways of dealing 
with reality, to expand the range of his efficacy, to grow intellectually , is an 
open door to a road that has no end. 

Man survives, not by adjusting himself to his physical environment in the 
manner of an animal, but by transforming his environment through 
productive work. “If a drought strikes them, animals perish — man builds 
irrigation canals; if a flood strikes them, animals perish — man builds dams; 
if a carnivorous pack attacks them, animals perish — man writes the 
Constitution of the United States.” (Ayn Rand, For the New Intellectual .) 

If life is a process of self-sustaining action, then this is the distinctly 
human mode of action and survival: to think — to produce — to meet the 
challenges of existence by a never-ending effort and inventiveness. 

When man discovered how to make fire to keep himself warm, his need of 
thought and effort was not ended; when he discovered how to fashion a bow 
and arrow, his need of thought and effort was not ended; when he discovered 
how to build a shelter out of stone, then out of brick, then out of glass and 
steel, his need of thought and effort was not ended; when he moved his life 
expectancy from nineteen to thirty to forty to sixty to seventy, his need of 
thought and effort was not ended; so long as he lives, his need of thought 
and effort is never ended.

Every achievement of man is a value in itself, but it is also a stepping- 
stone to greater achievements and values. Life is growth; not to move 
forward, is to fall backward; life remains life, only so long as it advances. 
Every step upward opens to man a wider range of action and achievement — 
and creates the need for that action and achievement. There is no final, 
permanent “plateau.” The problem of survival is never “solved,” once and 
for all, with no further thought or motion required. More precisely, the prob- 
lem of survival is solved, by recognizing that survival demands constant 
growth and creativeness. 

Constant growth is, further, a psychological need of man. It is a condition 
of his mental well-being. His mental well-being requires that he possess a 
firm sense of control over reality, of control over his existence — the 
conviction that he is competent to live. And this requires, not omniscience or 
omnipotence, but the knowledge that one’s methods of dealing with 
reality — the principles by which one functions — are right. Passivity is 
incompatible with this state. Self-esteem is not a value that, once achieved, 
is maintained automatically thereafter; like every other human value, 
including life itself, it can be maintained only by action. Self-esteem, the 
basic conviction that one is competent to live, can be maintained only so 
long as one is engaged in a process of growth, only so long as one is 
committed to the task of increasing one’s efficacy. In living entities, nature 
does not permit stillness: when one ceases to grow, one proceeds to disinte- 
grate — in the mental realm no less than in the physical. 

Observe, in this connection, the widespread phenomenon of men who are 
old by the time they are thirty. These are men who, having in effect 
concluded that they have “thought enough,” drift on the diminishing 
momentum of their past effort — and wonder what happened to their fire and 
energy, and why they are dimly anxious, and why their existence seems so 
desolately impoverished, and why they feel themselves sinking into some 
nameless abyss — and never identify the fact that, in abandoning the will to 
think, one abandons the will to live. 

Man’s need to grow — and his need, therefore, of the social or existential 
conditions that make growth possible — are facts of crucial importance to be 
considered in judging or evaluating any politico-economic system. One 
should be concerned to ask: Is a given politico-economic system pro-life or 
anti-life, conducive or inimical to the requirements of man’s survival? 

The great merit of capitalism is its unique appropriateness to the 
requirements of human survival and to man’s need to grow. Leaving men 
free to think, to act, to produce, to attempt the untried and the new, its

principles operate in a way that rewards effort and achievement, and 
penalizes passivity. 

This is one of the chief reasons for which it is denounced. 

In Who Is Ayn Rand?, discussing the nineteenth-century attacks on 
capitalism, I wrote: “In the writings of both medievalists and socialists, one 
can observe the unmistakable longing for a society in which man’s existence 
will be automatically guaranteed to him — that is, in which man will not have 
to bear responsibility for his own survival. Both camps project their ideal 
society as one characterized by that which they call ‘harmony,’ by freedom 
from rapid change or challenge or the exacting demands of competition; a 
society in which each must do his prescribed part to contribute to the well- 
being of the whole, but in which no one will face the necessity of making 
choices and decisions that will crucially affect his life and future; in which 
the question of what one has or has not earned, and does or does not deserve, 
will not come up; in which rewards will not be tied to achievement and in 
which someone’s benevolence will guarantee that one need never bear the 
consequences of one’s errors. The failure of capitalism to conform to what 
may be termed this pastoral view of existence, is essential to the medieval- 
ists’ and socialists’ indictment of a free society. It is not a Garden of Eden 
that capitalism offers men.” 

Among the arguments used by those who long for a “pastoral” existence, 
is a doctrine which, translated into explicit statement, consists of: the divine 
right of stagnation. 

This doctrine is illustrated in the following incident. Once, on a plane trip, 
I became engaged in conversation with an executive of a labor union. He 
began to decry the “disaster” of automation, asserting that increasing thou- 
sands of workers would be permanently unemployed as a result of new 
machines and that “something ought to be done about it.” I answered that 
this was a myth that had been exploded many times; that the introduction of 
new machines invariably resulted in increasing the demand for labor as well 
as in raising the general standard of living; that this was demonstrable 
theoretically and observable historically. I remarked that automation 
increased the demand for skilled labor relative to unskilled labor, and that 
doubtless many workers would need to learn new skills. “But,” he asked 
indignantly, “what about the workers who don’t want to learn new skills? 
Why should they have troubles?” 

This means that the ambition, the farsightedness, the drive to do better and 
still better, the living energy of creative men are to be throttled and 
suppressed — for the sake of men who have “thought enough” and “learned 


117 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


enough” and do not wish to be concerned with the future nor with the 
bothersome question of what their jobs depend on. 

Alone on a desert island, bearing sole responsibility for his own survival, 
no man could permit himself the delusion that tomorrow is not his concern, 
that he can safely rest on yesterday’s knowledge and skills, and that nature 
owes him “security.” It is only in society — where the burden of a man’s 
default can be passed to the shoulders of a man who did not default — that 
such a delusion can be indulged in. (And it is here that the morality of 
altruism becomes indispensable, to provide a sanction for such parasitism.) 

The claim that men doing the same type of job should all be paid the same 
wages, regardless of differences in their performance or output, thus 
penalizing the superior worker in favor of the inferior — this is the doctrine 
of the divine right of stagnation. 

The claim that men should keep their jobs or be promoted on grounds, not 
of merit, but of seniority, so that the mediocrity who is “in” is favored above 
the talented newcomer, thus blocking the newcomer’s future and that of his 
potential employer — this is the doctrine of the divine right of stagnation. 

The claim that an employer should be compelled to deal with a specific 
union which has an arbitrary power to exclude applicants for membership, 
so that the chance to work at a certain craft is handed down from father to 
son and no newcomer can enter to threaten the established vested interests, 
thus blocking progress in the entire field, like the guild system of the Middle 
Ages — this is the doctrine of the divine right of stagnation. 

The claim that men should be retained in jobs that have become 
unnecessary, doing work that is wasteful or superfluous, to spare them the 
difficulties of retraining for new jobs — thus contributing, as in the case of 
railroads, to the virtual destruction of an entire industry — this is the doctrine 
of the divine right of stagnation. 

The denunciation of capitalism for such “iniquities” as allowing an old 
comer grocer to be driven out of business by a big chain store, the 
denunciation implying that the economic well-being and progress of the old 
grocer’s customers and of the chain store owners should be throttled to 
protect the limitations of the old grocer’s initiative or skill — this is the 
doctrine of the divine right of stagnation. 

The court’s decree, under the antitrust laws, that a successful business 
establishment does not have a right to its patents, but must give them, 
royalty-free, to a would-be competitor who cannot afford to pay for them 
(&lt; General Electric case, 1948 ) — this is the doctrine of the divine right of 
stagnation. 


118 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


The court’s edict convicting and blocking a business concern for the 
crime of farsightedness, the crime of anticipating future demand and 
expanding plant capacity to meet it, and of thereby possibly “discouraging” 
future competitors ( ALCOA case, 1945) — this is the legal penalizing of 
growth, this is the penalizing of ability for being ability — and this is the 
naked essence and goal of the doctrine of the divine right of stagnation. 

Capitalism, by its nature, entails a constant process of motion, growth and 
progress. It creates the optimum social conditions for man to respond to the 
challenges of nature in such a way as best to further his life. It operates to 
the benefit of all those who choose to be active in the productive process, 
whatever their level of ability. But it is not geared to the demands of 
stagnation. Neither is reality. 

When one considers the spectacular success, the unprecedented 
prosperity, that capitalism has achieved in practice (even with hampering 
controls) — and when one considers the dismal failure of every variety of 
collectivism — it should be clear that the enemies of capitalism are not 
motivated, at root, by economic considerations. They are motivated by 
metaphysical considerations — by a rebellion against the human mode of 
survival, a rebellion against the fact that life is a process of self-sustaining 
and self-generated action — and by the dream that, if only they can harness 
the men who do not resent the nature of life, they will make existence 
tolerable for those who do resent it.

17. Racism 

by Ayn Rand 


Racism is the lowest, most crudely primitive form of collectivism. It is the 
notion of ascribing moral, social or political significance to a man’s genetic 
lineage — the notion that a man’s intellectual and characterological traits are 
produced and transmitted by his internal body chemistry. Which means, in 
practice, that a man is to be judged, not by his own character and actions, but 
by the characters and actions of a collective of ancestors. 

Racism claims that the content of a man’s mind (not his cognitive 
apparatus, but its content) is inherited; that a man’s convictions, values and 
character are determined before he is born, by physical factors beyond his 
control. This is the caveman’s version of the doctrine of innate ideas — or of 
inherited knowledge — which has been thoroughly refuted by philosophy and 
science. Racism is a doctrine of, by and for brutes. It is a barnyard or stock- 
farm version of collectivism, appropriate to a mentality that differentiates 
between various breeds of animals, but not between animals and men. 

Like every form of determinism, racism invalidates the specific attribute 
which distinguishes man from all other living species: his rational faculty. 
Racism negates two aspects of man’s life: reason and choice, or mind and 
morality, replacing them with chemical predestination. 

The respectable family that supports worthless relatives or covers up their 
crimes in order to “protect the family name” (as if the moral stature of one 
man could be damaged by the actions of another) — the bum who boasts that 
his great-grandfather was an empire-builder, or the small-town spinster who 
boasts that her maternal great-uncle was a state senator and her third cousin 
gave a concert at Carnegie Hall (as if the achievements of one man could rub 
off on the mediocrity of another) — the parents who search genealogical trees 
in order to evaluate their prospective sons-in-law — the celebrity who starts 
his autobiography with a detailed account of his family history — all these are 
samples of racism, the atavistic manifestations of a doctrine whose full 
expression is the tribal warfare of prehistorical savages, the wholesale 
slaughter of Nazi Germany, the atrocities of today’s so-called “newly 
emerging nations.” 

The theory that holds “good blood” or “bad blood” as a moral-intellectual 
criterion, can lead to nothing but torrents of blood in practice. Brute force is 
the only avenue of action open to men who regard themselves as mindless 
aggregates of chemicals.

Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


Modem racists attempt to prove the superiority or inferiority of a given 
race by the historical achievements of some of its members. The frequent 
historical spectacle of a great innovator who, in his lifetime, is jeered, 
denounced, obstructed, persecuted by his countrymen, and then, a few years 
after his death, is enshrined in a national monument and hailed as a proof of 
the greatness of the German (or French or Italian or Cambodian) race — is as 
revolting a spectacle of collectivist expropriation, perpetrated by racists, as 
any expropriation of material wealth perpetrated by communists. 

Just as there is no such thing as a collective or racial mind, so there is no 
such thing as a collective or racial achievement. There are only individual 
minds and individual achievements — and a culture is not the anonymous 
product of undifferentiated masses, but the sum of the intellectual 
achievements of individual men. 

Even if it were proved — which it is not — that the incidence of men of 
potentially superior brain power is greater among the members of certain 
races than among the members of others, it would still tell us nothing about 
any given individual and it would be irrelevant to one’s judgment of him. A 
genius is a genius, regardless of the number of morons who belong to the 
same race — and a moron is a moron, regardless of the number of geniuses 
who share his racial origin. It is hard to say which is the more outrageous 
injustice: the claim of Southern racists that a Negro genius should be treated 
as an inferior because his race has “produced” some brutes — or the claim of 
a German brute to the status of a superior because his race has “produced” 
Goethe, Schiller and Brahms. 

These are not two different claims, of course, but two applications of the 
same basic premise. The question of whether one alleges the superiority or 
the inferiority of any given race is irrelevant; racism has only one 
psychological root: the racist’s sense of his own inferiority. 

Like every other form of collectivism, racism is a quest for the unearned. 
It is a quest for automatic knowledge — for an automatic evaluation of men’s 
characters that bypasses the responsibility of exercising rational or moral 
judgment — and, above all, a quest for an automatic self-esteem (or pseudo- 
self-esteem). 

To ascribe one’s virtues to one’s racial origin, is to confess that one has 
no knowledge of the process by which virtues are acquired and, most often, 
that one has failed to acquire them. The overwhelming majority of racists are 
men who have earned no sense of personal identity, who can claim no 
individual achievement or distinction, and who seek the illusion of a “tribal 
self-esteem” by alleging the inferiority of some other tribe. Observe the 
hysterical intensity of the Southern racists; observe also that racism is much 


121 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


more prevalent among the poor white trash than among their intellectual 
betters. 

Historically, racism has always risen or fallen with the rise or fall of 
collectivism. Collectivism holds that the individual has no rights, that his life 
and work belong to the group (to “society,” to the tribe, the state, the nation) 
and that the group may sacrifice him at its own whim to its own interests. 
The only way to implement a doctrine of that kind is by means of brute 
force — and statism has always been the political corollary of collectivism. 

The absolute state is merely an institutionalized form of gang-rule, 
regardless of which particular gang seizes power. And — since there is no 
rational justification for such rule, since none has ever been or can ever be 
offered — the mystique of racism is a crucial element in every variant of the 
absolute state. The relationship is reciprocal: statism rises out of 
prehistorical tribal warfare, out of the notion that the men of one tribe are the 
natural prey for the men of another — and establishes its own internal 
subcategories of racism, a system of castes determined by a man’s birth, 
such as inherited titles of nobility or inherited serfdom. 

The racism of Nazi Germany — where men had to fill questionnaires about 
their ancestry for generations back, in order to prove their Aryan descent — 
has its counterpart in Soviet Russia, where men had to fill similar 
questionnaires to show that their ancestors had owned no property and thus 
to prove their proletarian descent. The Soviet ideology rests on the notion 
that men can be conditioned to communism genetically — that is, that a few 
generations conditioned by dictatorship will transmit communist ideology to 
their descendants, who will be communists at birth. The persecution of 
racial minorities in Soviet Russia, according to the racial descent and whim 
of any given commissar, is a matter of record; anti-Semitism is particularly 
prevalent — only the official pogroms are now called “political purges.” 

There is only one antidote to racism: the philosophy of individualism and 
its politico-economic corollary, laissez-faire capitalism. 

Individualism regards man — every man — as an independent, sovereign 
entity who possesses an inalienable right to his own life, a right derived from 
his nature as a rational being. Individualism holds that a civilized society, or 
any form of association, cooperation or peaceful coexistence among men, 
can be achieved only on the basis of the recognition of individual rights — 
and that a group, as such, has no rights other than the individual rights of its 
members. (See Chapters 12 and 13.) 

It is not a man’s ancestors or relatives or genes or body chemistry that 
count in a free market, but only one human attribute: productive ability. It is 


122 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


by his own individual ability and ambition that capitalism judges a man and 
rewards him accordingly. 

No political system can establish universal rationality by law (or by 
force). But capitalism is the only system that functions in a way which 
rewards rationality and penalizes all forms of irrationality, including racism. 

A fully free, capitalist system has not yet existed anywhere. But what is 
enormously significant is the correlation of racism and political controls in 
the semifree economies of the nineteenth century. Racial and/or religious 
persecutions of minorities stood in inverse ratio to the degree of a country’s 
freedom. Racism was strongest in the more controlled economies, such as 
Russia and Germany — and weakest in England, the then freest country of 
Europe. 

It is capitalism that gave mankind its first steps toward freedom and a 
rational way of life. It is capitalism that broke through national and racial 
barriers, by means of free trade. It is capitalism that abolished serfdom and 
slavery in all the civilized countries of the world. It is the capitalist North 
that destroyed the slavery of the agrarian-feudal South in the United States. 

Such was the trend of mankind for the brief span of some hundred and 
fifty years. The spectacular results and achievements of that trend need no 
restatement here. 

The rise of collectivism reversed that trend. 

When men began to be indoctrinated once more with the notion that the 
individual possesses no rights, that supremacy, moral authority and 
unlimited power belong to the group, and that a man has no significance 
outside his group — the inevitable consequence was that men began to 
gravitate toward some group or another, in self-protection, in bewilderment 
and in subconscious terror. The simplest collective to join, the easiest one to 
identify — particularly for people of limited intelligence — the least 
demanding form of “belonging” and of “togetherness” is: race. 

It is thus that the theoreticians of collectivism, the “humanitarian” 
advocates of a “benevolent” absolute state, have led to the rebirth and the 
new, virulent growth of racism in the twentieth century. 

In its great era of capitalism, the United States was the freest country on 
earth — and the best refutation of racist theories. Men of all races came here, 
some from obscure, culturally undistinguished countries, and accomplished 
feats of productive ability which would have remained stillborn in their 
control-ridden native lands. Men of racial groups that had been slaughtering 
one another for centuries, learned to live together in harmony and peaceful 
cooperation. America had been called “the melting pot,” with good reason. 
But few people realized that America did not melt men into the gray 


123 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


conformity of a collective: she united them by means of protecting their 
right to individuality. 

The major victims of such race prejudice as did exist in America were the 
Negroes. It was a problem originated and perpetuated by the noncapitalist 
South, though not confined to its boundaries. The persecution of Negroes in 
the South was and is truly disgraceful. But in the rest of the country, so long 
as men were free, even that problem was slowly giving way under the 
pressure of enlightenment and of the white men’s own economic interests. 

Today, that problem is growing worse — and so is every other form of 
racism. America has become race-conscious in a manner reminiscent of the 
worst days in the most backward countries of nineteenth-century Europe. 
The cause is the same: the growth of collectivism and statism. 

In spite of the clamor for racial equality, propagated by the “liberals” in 
the past few decades, the Census Bureau reported recently that “[the 
Negro’s] economic status relative to whites has not improved for nearly 20 
years.” It had been improving in the freer years of our “mixed economy”; it 
deteriorated with the progressive enlargement of the “liberals’ ” Welfare 
State. 

The growth of racism in a “mixed economy” keeps step with the growth 
of government controls. A “mixed economy” disintegrates a country into an 
institutionalized civil war of pressure groups, each fighting for legislative 
favors and special privileges at the expense of one another. 

The existence of such pressure groups and of their political lobbies is 
openly and cynically acknowledged today. The pretense at any political 
philosophy, any principles, ideals or long-range goals is fast disappearing 
from our scene — and it is all but admitted that this country is now floating 
without direction, at the mercy of a blind, short-range power game played by 
various statist gangs, each intent on getting hold of a legislative gun for any 
special advantage of the immediate moment. 

In the absence of any coherent political philosophy, every economic 
group has been acting as its own destroyer, selling out its future for some 
momentary privilege. The policy of the businessmen has, for some time, 
been the most suicidal one in this respect. But it has been surpassed by the 
current policy of the Negro leaders. 

So long as the Negro leaders were fighting against government-enforced 
discrimination — right, justice and morality were on their side. But that is not 
what they are fighting any longer. The confusions and contradictions 
surrounding the issue of racism have now reached an incredible climax. 

It is time to clarify the principles involved. 


124 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


The policy of the Southern states toward Negroes was and is a shameful 
contradiction of this country’s basic principles. Racial discrimination, 
imposed and enforced by law, is so blatantly inexcusable an infringement of 
individual rights that the racist statutes of the South should have been de- 
clared unconstitutional long ago. 

The Southern racists’ claim of “states’ rights” is a contradiction in terms: 
there can be no such thing as the “right” of some men to violate the rights of 
others. The constitutional concept of “states’ rights” pertains to the division 
of power between local and national authorities, and serves to protect the 
states from the Federal government; it does not grant to a state government 
an unlimited, arbitrary power over its citizens or the privilege of abrogating 
the citizens’ individual rights. 

It is true that the Federal government has used the racial issue to enlarge 
its own power and to set a precedent of encroachment upon the legitimate 
rights of the states, in an unnecessary and unconstitutional manner. But this 
merely means that both governments are wrong; it does not excuse the 
policy of the Southern racists. 

One of the worst contradictions, in this context, is the stand of many so- 
called “conservatives” (not confined exclusively to the South) who claim to 
be defenders of freedom, of capitalism, of property rights, of the 
Constitution, yet who advocate racism at the same time. They do not seem to 
possess enough concern with principles to realize that they are cutting the 
ground from under their own feet. Men who deny individual rights cannot 
claim, defend or uphold any rights whatsoever. It is such alleged champions 
of capitalism who are helping to discredit and destroy it. 

The “liberals” are guilty of the same contradiction, but in a different form. 
They advocate the sacrifice of all individual rights to unlimited majority 
rule — yet posture as defenders of the rights of minorities. But the smallest 
minority on earth is the individual. Those who deny individual rights, cannot 
claim to be defenders of minorities. 

This accumulation of contradictions, of shortsighted pragmatism, of 
cynical contempt for principles, of outrageous irrationality, has now reached 
its climax in the new demands of the Negro leaders. 

Instead of fighting against racial discrimination, they are demanding that 
racial discrimination be legalized and enforced. Instead of fighting against 
racism, they are demanding the establishment of racial quotas. Instead of 
fighting for “color-blindness” in social and economic issues, they are 
proclaiming that “color-blindness” is evil and that “color” should be made a 
primary consideration. Instead of fighting for equal rights, they are 
demanding special race privileges. 


125 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


They are demanding that racial quotas be established in regard to 
employment and that jobs be distributed on a racial basis, in proportion to 
the percentage of a given race among the local population. For instance, 
since Negroes constitute 25 per cent of the population of New York City, 
they demand 25 per cent of the jobs in a given establishment. 

Racial quotas have been one of the worst evils of racist regimes. There 
were racial quotas in the universities of Czarist Russia, in the population of 
Russia’s major cities, etc. One of the accusations against the racists in this 
country is that some schools practice a secret system of racial quotas. It was 
regarded as a victory for justice when employment questionnaires ceased to 
inquire about an applicant’s race or religion. 

Today, it is not an oppressor, but an oppressed minority group that is 
demanding the establishment of racial quotas. (!) 

This particular demand was too much even for the “liberals.” Many of 
them denounced it — properly — with shocked indignation. 

Wrote The N. Y. Times (July 23, 1963): “The demonstrators are following 
a truly vicious principle in playing the ‘numbers game.’ A demand that 25 
per cent (or any other percentage) of jobs be given to Negroes (or any other 
group) is wrong for one basic reason: it calls for a ‘quota system,’ which is 
in itself discriminatory. ... This newspaper has long fought a religious quota 
in respect to judgeships; we equally oppose a racial quota in respect to jobs 
from the most elevated to the most menial.” 

As if the blatant racism of such a demand were not enough, some Negro 
leaders went still farther. Whitney M. Young Jr., executive director of the 
National Urban League, made the following statement {N. Y. Times, August 
1 ): 

“The white leadership must be honest enough to grant that throughout our 
history there has existed a special privileged class of citizens who received 
preferred treatment. That class was white. Now we’re saying this: If two 
men, one Negro and one white, are equally qualified for a job, hire the 
Negro.” 

Consider the implications of that statement. It does not merely demand 
special privileges on racial grounds — it demands that white men be 
penalized for the sins of their ancestors. It demands that a white laborer be 
refused a job because his grandfather may have practiced racial discrimi- 
nation. But perhaps his grandfather had not practiced it. Or perhaps his 
grandfather had not even lived in this country. Since these questions are not 
to be considered, it means that that white laborer is to be charged with 
collective racial guilt, the guilt consisting merely of the color of his skin. 


126 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


But that is the principle of the worst Southern racist who charges all 
Negroes with collective racial guilt for any crime committed by an 
individual Negro, and who treats them all as inferiors on the ground that 
their ancestors were savages. 

The only comment one can make about demands of that kind, is: “By 
what right? — By what code? — By what standard?” 

That absurdly evil policy is destroying the moral base of the Negroes’ 
fight. Their case rested on the principle of individual rights. If they demand 
the violation of the rights of others, they negate and forfeit their own. Then 
the same answer applies to them as to the Southern racists: there can be no 
such thing as the “right” of some men to violate the rights of others. 

Yet the entire policy of the Negro leaders is now moving in that direction. 
For instance, the demand for racial quotas in schools, with the proposal that 
hundreds of children, white and Negro, be forced to attend school in distant 
neighborhoods — for the purpose of “racial balance.” Again, this is pure 
racism. As opponents of this demand have pointed out, to assign children to 
certain schools by reason of their race, is equally evil whether one does it for 
purposes of segregation or integration. And the mere idea of using children 
as pawns in a political game should outrage all parents, of any race, creed or 
color. 

The “civil rights” bill, now under consideration in Congress, is another 
example of a gross infringement of individual rights. It is proper to forbid all 
discrimination in government-owned facilities and establishments: the 
government has no right to discriminate against any citizens. And by the 
very same principle, the government has no right to discriminate for some 
citizens at the expense of others. It has no right to violate the right of private 
property by forbidding discrimination in privately owned establishments. 

No man, neither Negro nor white, has any claim to the property of another 
man. A man’s rights are not violated by a private individual’s refusal to deal 
with him. Racism is an evil, irrational and morally contemptible doctrine — 
but doctrines cannot be forbidden or prescribed by law. Just as we have to 
protect a communist’s freedom of speech, even though his doctrines are evil, 
so we have to protect a racist’s right to the use and disposal of his own 
property. Private racism is not a legal, but a moral issue — and can be fought 
only by private means, such as economic boycott or social ostracism. 

Needless to say, if that “civil rights” bill is passed, it will be the worst 
breach of property rights in the sorry record of American history in respect 
to that subject . 6 


6 “The bill was passed in 1964, including the sections that violate property rights. 


127

It is an ironic demonstration of the philosophical insanity and the 
consequently suicidal trend of our age, that the men who need the protection 
of individual rights most urgently — the Negroes — are now in the vanguard 
of the destruction of these rights. 

A word of warning: do not become victims of the same racists by 
succumbing to racism; do not hold against all Negroes the disgraceful 
irrationality of some of their leaders. No group has any proper intellectual 
leadership today or any proper representation. 

In conclusion, I shall quote from an astonishing editorial in The N. Y. 
Times of August 4 — astonishing because ideas of this nature are not typical 
of our age: 

“But the question must be not whether a group recognizable in color, 
features or culture has its rights as a group. No, the question is whether any 
American individual, regardless of color, features or culture, is deprived of 
his rights as an American. If the individual has all the rights and privileges 
due him under the laws and the Constitution, we need not worry about 
groups and masses — those do not, in fact, exist, except as figures of speech.”

18. Counterfeit individualism 

by Nathaniel Branden 


The theory of individualism is a central component of the Objectivist 
philosophy. Individualism is at once an ethical-political concept and an 
ethical-psychological one. As an ethical-political concept, individualism 
upholds the supremacy of individual rights, the principle that man is an end 
in himself, not a means to the ends of others. As an ethical-psychological 
concept, individualism holds that man should think and judge independently, 
valuing nothing higher than the sovereignty of his intellect. 

The philosophical base and validation of individualism, as Ayn Rand has 
shown in Atlas Shrugged, is the fact that individualism, ethically, politically 
and psychologically, is an objective requirement of man’s proper survival, of 
man’s survival qua man, qua rational being. It is implicit in, and necessitated 
by, a code of ethics that holds man ’s life as its standard of value. 

The advocacy of individualism as such is not new; what is new is the 
Objectivist validation of the theory of individualism and the definition of a 
consistent way to practice it. 

Too often, the ethical-political meaning of individualism is held to be: 
doing whatever one wishes, regardless of the rights of others. Writers such 
as Nietzsche and Max Stimer are sometimes quoted in support of this 
interpretation. Altruists and collectivists have an obvious vested interest in 
persuading men that such is the meaning of individualism, that the man who 
refuses to be sacrificed intends to sacrifice others. 

The contradiction in, and refutation of, such an interpretation of 
individualism is this: since the only rational base of individualism as an 
ethical principle is the requirements of man’s survival qua man, one man 
cannot claim the moral right to violate the rights of another. If he denies 
inviolate rights to other men, he cannot claim such rights for himself; he has 
rejected the base of rights. No one can claim the moral right to a 
contradiction. 

Individualism does not consist merely of rejecting the belief that man 
should live for the collective. A man who seeks escape from the 
responsibility of supporting his life by his own thought and effort, and 
wishes to survive by conquering, ruling and exploiting others, is not an 
individualist. An individualist is a man who lives for his own sake and by 
his own mind', he neither sacrifices himself to others nor sacrifices others to 


129 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


himself; he deals with men as a trader — not as a looter; as a Producer — not 
as an Attila. 

It is the recognition of this distinction that altruists and collectivists wish 
men to lose: the distinction between a trader and a looter, between a 
Producer and an Attila. 

If the meaning of individualism, in its ethical-political context, has been 
perverted and debased predominantly by its avowed antagonists, the 
meaning of individualism, in its ethical-psychological context, has been 
perverted and debased predominantly by its professed supporters', by those 
who wish to dissolve the distinction between an independent judgment and a 
subjective whim. These are the alleged “individualists” who equate 
individualism, not with independent thought , but with “independent 
feelings .” There are no such things as “independent feelings There is only 
an independent mind. 

An individualist is, first and foremost, a man of reason. It is upon the 
ability to think, upon his rational faculty, that man’s life depends; rationality 
is the precondition of independence and self-reliance. An “individualist” 
who is neither independent nor self-reliant, is a contradiction in terms; 
individualism and independence are logically inseparable. The basic 
independence of the individualist consists of his loyalty to his own mind: it 
is his perception of the facts of reality, his understanding , his judgment, that 
he refuses to sacrifice to the unproved assertions of others. That is the 
meaning of intellectual independence — and that is the essence of an 
individualist. He is dispassionately and intransigently /hc/-centered. 

Man needs knowledge in order to survive, and only reason can achieve it; 
men who reject the responsibility of thought and reason, can exist only as 
parasites on the thinking of others. And a parasite is not an individualist. The 
irrationalist, the whim- worshiper who regards knowledge and objectivity as 
“restrictions” on his freedom, the range-of-the-moment hedonist who acts on 
his private feelings, is not an individualist. The “independence” that an 
irrationalist seeks is independence from reality — like Dostoevsky’s 
Underground man who cries: “What do I care for the laws of nature and 
arithmetic, when, for some reason, I dislike those laws and the fact that 
twice two makes four?” 

To the irrationalist, existence is merely a clash between his whims and the 
whims of others', the concept of an objective reality has no reality to him. 

Rebelliousness or unconventionality as such do not constitute proof of 
individualism. Just as individualism does not consist merely of rejecting 
collectivism, so it does not consist merely of the absence of conformity. A 
conformist is a man who declares, “It’s true because others believe it” — but 


130 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


an individualist is not a man who declares, “It’s true because / believe it.” 
An individualist declares, “I believe it because I see in reason that it’s true.” 

There is an incident in The Fountainhead that is worth recalling in this 
connection. In the chapter on the life and career of collectivist Ellsworth 
Toohey, Ayn Rand describes the various groups of writers and artists that 
Toohey organized: there was “... a woman who never used capitals in her 
books, and a man who never used commas ... and another who wrote poems 
that neither rhymed nor scanned ... There was a boy who used no canvas, but 
did something with bird cages and metronomes ... A few friends pointed out 
to Ellsworth Toohey that he seemed guilty of inconsistency; he was so 
deeply opposed to individualism, they said, and here were all these writers 
and artists of his, and every one of them was a rabid individualist. ‘Do you 

n 

really think so?’ said Toohey, smiling blandly.” 

What Toohey knew — and what students of Objectivism would do well to 
understand — is that such subjectivists, in their rebellion against “the tyranny 
of reality,” are less independent and more abjectly parasitical than the most 
commonplace Babbitt whom they profess to despise. They originate or 
create nothing; they are profoundly selfless — and they struggle to fill the 
void of the egos they do not possess, by means of the only form of “self- 
assertiveness” they recognize: defiance for the sake of defiance, irrationality 
for the sake of irrationality, destruction for the sake of destruction, whims 
for the sake of whims. 

A psychotic is scarcely likely to be accused of conformity; but neither a 
psychotic nor a subjectivist is an exponent of individualism. 

Observe the common denominator in the attempts to corrupt the meaning 
of individualism as an ethical-political concept and as an ethical- 
psychological concept: the attempt to divorce individualism from reason. 
But it is only in the context of reason and man’s needs as a rational being 
that the principle of individualism can be justified. Torn out of this context, 
any advocacy of “individualism” becomes as arbitrary and irrational as the 
advocacy of collectivism. 

This is the basis of Objectivism’s total opposition to any alleged 
“individualists” who attempt to equate individualism with subjectivism. 

And this is the basis of Objectivism’s total repudiation of any self-styled 
“Objectivists” who permit themselves to believe that any compromise, 
meeting ground or rapprochement is possible between Objectivism and that

counterfeit individualism which consists of declaring: “It’s right because 1 
feel it” or “It’s good because I want it” or “It’s true because I believe it.”

19. The Argument from Intimidation 

by Ayn Rand 


There is a certain type of argument which, in fact, is not an argument, but a 
means of forestalling debate and extorting an opponent’s agreement with 
one’s undiscussed notions. It is a method of bypassing logic by means of 
psychological pressure. Since it is particularly prevalent in today’s culture 
and is going to grow more so in the next few months, one would do well to 
leam to identify it and be on guard against it. 

This method bears a certain resemblance to the fallacy ad hominem, and 
comes from the same psychological root, but is different in essential 
meaning. The ad hominem fallacy consists of attempting to refute an 
argument by impeaching the character of its proponent. Example: 
“Candidate X is immoral, therefore his argument is false.” 

But the psychological pressure method consists of threatening to impeach 
an opponent’s character by means of his argument, thus impeaching the 
argument without debate. Example: “Only the immoral can fail to see that 
Candidate X’s argument is false.” 

In the first case, Candidate X’s immorality (real or invented) is offered as 
proof of the falsehood of his argument. In the second case, the falsehood of 
his argument is asserted arbitrarily and offered as proof of his immorality. 

In today’s epistemological jungle, that second method is used more 
frequently than any other type of irrational argument. It should be classified 
as a logical fallacy and may be designated as “The Argument from 
Intimidation.” 

The essential characteristic of the Argument from Intimidation is its 
appeal to moral self-doubt and its reliance on the fear, guilt or ignorance of 
the victim. It is used in the form of an ultimatum demanding that the victim 
renounce a given idea without discussion, under threat of being considered 
morally unworthy. The pattern is always: “Only those who are evil 
(dishonest, heartless, insensitive, ignorant, etc.) can hold such an idea.” 

The classic example of the Argument from Intimidation is the story The 
Emperor’s New Clothes. 

In that story, some charlatans sell nonexistent garments to the Emperor by 
asserting that the garments’ unusual beauty makes them invisible to those 
who are morally depraved at heart. Observe the psychological factors 
required to make this work: the charlatans rely on the Emperor’s self-doubt; 
the Emperor does not question their assertion nor their moral authority; he 


133 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


surrenders at once, claiming that he does see the garments — thus denying the 
evidence of his own eyes and invalidating his own consciousness — rather 
than face a threat to his precarious self-esteem. His distance from reality 
may be gauged by the fact that he prefers to walk naked down the street, 
displaying his nonexistent garments to the people — rather than risk incurring 
the moral condemnation of two scoundrels. The people, prompted by the 
same psychological panic, try to surpass one another in loud exclamations 
on the splendor of his clothes — until a child cries out that the Emperor is 
naked. 

This is the exact pattern of the working of the Argument from 
Intimidation, as it is being worked all around us today. 

We have all heard it and are hearing it constantly: 

“Only those who lack finer instincts can fail to accept the morality of 
altruism.” — ’’Only the ignorant can fail to know that reason has been 
invalidated.” — ’’Only black-hearted reactionaries can advocate 
capitalism.” — ’’Only war-mongers can oppose the United Nations.” — ’’Only 
the lunatic fringe can still believe in freedom.” — ’’Only cowards can fail to 
see that life is a sewer.” — ’’Only the superficial can seek beauty, happiness, 
achievement, values or heroes.” 

As an example of an entire field of activity based on nothing but the 
Argument from Intimidation, I give you modern art — where, in order to 
prove that they do possess the special insight possessed only by the mystic 
“elite,” the populace are trying to surpass one another in loud exclamations 
on the splendor of some bare (but smudged) piece of canvas. 

The Argument from Intimidation dominates today’s discussions in two 
forms. In public speeches and print, it flourishes in the form of long, 
involved, elaborate structures of unintelligible verbiage, which convey 
nothing clearly except a moral threat. (“Only the primitive-minded can fail 
to realize that clarity is oversimplification.”) But in private, day-to-day 
experience, it comes up wordlessly, between the lines, in the form of 
inarticulate sounds conveying unstated implications. It relies, not on what is 
said, but on how it is said — not on content, but on tone of voice. 

The tone is usually one of scornful or belligerent incredulity. “Surely you 
are not an advocate of capitalism, are you?” And if this does not intimidate 
the prospective victim — who answers, properly: “I am,” — the ensuing 
dialogue goes something like this: “Oh, you couldn’t be! Not really l” 
“Really.” “But everybody knows that capitalism is outdated!” “I don’t.” “Oh, 
come now!” “Since I don’t know it, will you please tell me the reasons for 
thinking that capitalism is outdated?” “Oh, don’t be ridiculous!” “Will you 


134 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


tell me the reasons?” “Well, really, if you don’t know, I couldn’t possibly 
tell you!” 

All this is accompanied by raised eyebrows, wide-eyed stares, shrugs, 
grunts, snickers and the entire arsenal of nonverbal signals communicating 
ominous innuendoes and emotional vibrations of a single kind: disapproval. 

If those vibrations fail, if such debaters are challenged, one finds that they 
have no arguments, no evidence, no proof, no reason, no ground to stand 
on — that their noisy aggressiveness serves to hide a vacuum — that the 
Argument from Intimidation is a confession of intellectual impotence. 

The primordial archetype of that Argument is obvious (and so are the 
reasons of its appeal to the neo-mysticism of our age): “To those who 
understand, no explanation is necessary; to those who don’t, none is 
possible.” 

o 

The psychological source of that Argument is social metaphysics. 

A social metaphysician is one who regards the consciousness of other 
men as superior to his own and to the facts of reality. It is to a social 
metaphysician that the moral appraisal of himself by others is a primary 
concern which supersedes truth, facts, reason, logic. The disapproval of 
others is so shatteringly terrifying to him that nothing can withstand its 
impact within his consciousness; thus he would deny the evidence of his 
own eyes and invalidate his own consciousness for the sake of any stray 
charlatan’s moral sanction. It is only a social metaphysician who could 
conceive of such absurdity as hoping to win an intellectual argument by 
hinting: “But people won’t like you!” 

Strictly speaking, a social metaphysician does not conceive of his 
Argument in conscious terms: he finds it “instinctively” by introspection — 
since it represents his psycho-epistemological way of life. We have all met 
the exasperating type of person who does not listen to what one says, but to 
the emotional vibrations of one’s voice, anxiously translating them into 
approval or disapproval, then answering accordingly. This is a kind of self- 
imposed Argument from Intimidation, to which a social metaphysician 
surrenders in most of his human encounters. And thus when he meets an 
adversary, when his premises are challenged, he resorts automatically to the 
weapon that terrifies him most: the withdrawal of a moral sanction. 

Since that kind of terror is unknown to psychologically healthy men, they 
may be taken in by the Argument from Intimidation, precisely because of 
their innocence. Unable to understand that Argument’s motive or to believe 
that it is merely a senseless bluff, they assume that its user has some sort of 


See: Nathaniel Branden, “Social Metaphysics,” The Objectivist Newsletter, November 1962. 


135 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


knowledge or reasons to back up his seemingly self-confident, belligerent 
assertions; they give him the benefit of the doubt — and are left in helplessly 
bewildered confusion. It is thus that the social metaphysicians can victimize 
the young, the innocent, the conscientious. 

This is particularly prevalent in college classrooms. Many professors use 
the Argument from Intimidation to stifle independent thinking among the 
students, to evade questions they cannot answer, to discourage any critical 
analysis of their arbitrary assumptions or any departure from the intellectual 
status quo. 

“Aristotle? My dear fellow — ” (a weary sigh) “if you had read Professor 
Spiffkin’s piece in — ” (reverently) “the January 1912 issue of Intellect 
magazine, which — ” (contemptuously) “you obviously haven’t, you would 
know — ” (airily) “that Aristotle has been refuted.” 

“Professor X?” (X standing for the name of a distinguished theorist of 
free-enterprise economics.) “Are you quoting Professor X? Oh no, not 
really!” — followed by a sarcastic chuckle intended to convey that Professor 
X had been thoroughly discredited. (By whom? Blank out.) 

Such teachers are frequently assisted by the “liberal” goon squad of the 
classroom, who burst into laughter at appropriate moments. 

In our political life, the Argument from Intimidation is the almost 
exclusive method of discussion. Predominantly, today’s political debates 
consist of smears and apologies, or intimidation and appeasement. The first 
is usually (though not exclusively) practiced by the “liberals,” the second by 
the “conservatives.” The champions, in this respect, are the “liberal” 
Republicans who practice both: the first, toward their “conservative” fellow 
Republicans — the second, toward the Democrats. 

All smears are Arguments from Intimidation: they consist of derogatory 
assertions without any evidence or proof, offered as a substitute for evidence 
or proof, aimed at the moral cowardice or unthinking credulity of the 
hearers. 

The Argument from Intimidation is not new; it has been used in all ages 
and cultures, but seldom on so wide a scale as today. It is used more crudely 
in politics than in other fields of activity, but it is not confined to politics. It 
permeates our entire culture. It is a symptom of cultural bankruptcy. 

How does one resist that Argument? There is only one weapon against it: 
moral certainty. 

When one enters any intellectual battle, big or small, public or private, 
one cannot seek, desire or expect the enemy’s sanction. Truth or falsehood 
must be one’s sole concern and sole criterion of judgment — not anyone’s 


136 



Ayn Rand - THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS 


approval or disapproval; and, above all, not the approval of those whose 
standards are the opposite of one’s own. 

Let me emphasize that the Argument from Intimidation does not consist 
of introducing moral judgment into intellectual issues, but of substituting 
moral judgment for intellectual argument. Moral evaluations are implicit in 
most intellectual issues; it is not merely permissible, but mandatory to pass 
moral judgment when and where appropriate; to suppress such judgment is 
an act of moral cowardice. But a moral judgment must always follow, not 
precede (or supersede), the reasons on which it is based. 

When one gives reasons for one’s verdict, one assumes responsibility for 
it and lays oneself open to objective judgment: if one’s reasons are wrong or 
false, one suffers the consequences. But to condemn without giving reasons 
is an act of irresponsibility, a kind of moral “hit-and-run” driving, which is 
the essence of the Argument from Intimidation. 

Observe that the men who use that Argument are the ones who dread a 
reasoned moral attack more than any other kind of battle — and when they 
encounter a morally confident adversary, they are loudest in protesting that 
“moralizing” should be kept out of intellectual discussions. But to discuss 
evil in a manner implying neutrality, is to sanction it. 

The Argument from Intimidation illustrates why it is important to be 
certain of one’s premises and of one’s moral ground. It illustrates the kind of 
intellectual pitfall that awaits those who venture forth without a full, clear, 
consistent set of convictions, wholly integrated all the way down to 
fundamentals — those who recklessly leap into battle, armed with nothing but 
a few random notions floating in a fog of the unknown, the unidentified, the 
undefined, the unproved, and supported by nothing but their feelings, hopes 
and fears. The Argument from Intimidation is their Nemesis. In moral and 
intellectual issues, it is not enough to be right: one has to know that one is 
right. 

The most illustrious example of the proper answer to the Argument from 
Intimidation was given in American history by the man who, rejecting the 
enemy’s moral standards and with full certainty of his own rectitude, said: 

“If this be treason, make the most of it.”
