<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Help!' cried Frodo and Sam running towards him with their hands<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">stretched out.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Whoa! Whoa! steady there!â€™ cried the old man, holding up one hand, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">they stopped short, as if they had been struck stiff. 'Now, my little<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">fellows, where be you a-going to, puffing like a bellows? What's the matter<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">here then? Do you know who I am? I'm Tom Bombadil. Tell me what's<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">your<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">trouble! Tom's in a hurry now. Don't you crush my lilies!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'My friends are caught in the willow-tree,' cried Frodo breathlessly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Master Merry's being squeezed in a crack!' cried Sam.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'What?' shouted Tom Bombadil, leaping up in the air. 'Old Man Willow?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Naught worse than that, eh? That can soon be mended. I know the tune for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">him. Old grey Willow-man! I'll freeze his marrow cold, if he don't behave<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">himself. I'll sing his roots off. I'll sing a wind up and blow leaf and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">branch away. Old Man Willow!' Setting down his lilies carefully on the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">grass, he ran to the tree. There he saw Merry's feet still sticking out -<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the rest had already been drawn further inside. Tom put his mouth to the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">crack and began singing into it in a low voice. They could not catch the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">words, but evidently Merry was aroused. His legs began to kick. Tom sprang<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">away, and breaking off a hanging branch smote the side of the willow with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">it. 'You let them out again, Old Man Willow!' he said. 'What be you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">a-thinking of? You should not be waking. Eat earth! Dig deep! Drink water!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Go to sleep! Bombadil is talking!' He then seized Merry's feet and drew him<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">out of the suddenly widening crack.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There was a tearing creak and the other crack split open, and out of it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Pippin sprang, as if he had been kicked. Then with a loud snap both cracks<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">closed fast again. A shudder ran through the tree from root to tip, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">complete silence fell.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Thank you!' said the hobbits, one after the other.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tom Bombadil burst out laughing. 'Well, my little fellows!' said he,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">stooping so that he peered into their faces. 'You shall come home with me!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The table is all laden with yellow cream, honeycomb, and white bread and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">butter. Goldberry is waiting. Time enough for questions around the supper<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">table. You follow after me as quick as you are able!' With that he picked up<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">his lilies, and then with a beckoning wave of his hand went hopping and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">dancing along the path eastward, still singing loudly and nonsensically.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Too surprised and too relieved to talk, the hobbits followed after him<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">as fast as they could. But that was not fast enough. Tom soon disappeared in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">front of them, and the noise of his singing got fainter and further away.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Suddenly his voice came floating back to them in a loud halloo!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Hop along, my little friends, up the Withywindle!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tom's going on ahead candles for to kindle.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Down west sinks the Sun: soon you will be groping.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When the night-shadows fall, then the door will open,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Out of the window-panes light will twinkle yellow.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fear no alder black! Heed no hoary willow!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fear neither root nor bough! Tom goes on before you.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Hey now! merry dot! We'll be waiting for you!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After that the hobbits heard no more. Almost at once the sun seemed to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">sink into the trees behind them. They thought of the slanting light of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">evening glittering on the Brandywine River, and the windows of Bucklebury<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">beginning to gleam with hundreds of lights. Great shadows fell across them;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">trunks and branches of trees hung dark and threatening over the path. White<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">mists began to rise and curl on the surface of the river and stray about the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">roots of the trees upon its borders. Out of the very ground at their feet a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">shadowy steam arose and mingled with the swiftly falling dusk.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It became difficult to follow the path, and they were very tired. Their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">legs seemed leaden. Strange furtive noises ran among the bushes and reeds on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">either side of them; and if they looked up to the pale sky, they caught<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">sight of queer gnarled and knobbly faces that gloomed dark against the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">twilight, and leered down at them from the high bank and the edges of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">wood. They began to feel that all this country was unreal, and that they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">were stumbling through an ominous dream that led to no awakening.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Just as they felt their feet slowing down to a standstill, they noticed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that the ground was gently rising. The water began to murmur. In the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">darkness they caught the white glimmer of foam, where the river flowed over<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">a short fall. Then suddenly the trees came to an end and the mists were left<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">behind. They stepped out from the Forest, and found a wide sweep of grass<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">welling up before them. The river, now small and swift, was leaping merrily<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">down to meet them, glinting here and there in the light of the stars, which<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">were already shining in the sky.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The grass under their feet was smooth and short, as if it had been mown<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">or shaven. The eaves of the Forest behind were clipped, and trim as a hedge.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The path was now plain before them, well -tended and bordered with stone. It<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">wound up on to the top of a grassy knoll, now grey under the pale starry<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">night; and there, still high above them on a further slope, they saw the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">twinkling lights of a house. Down again the path went, and then up again, up<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">a long smooth hillside of turf, towards the light. Suddenly a wide yellow<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">beam flowed out brightly from a door that was opened. There was Tom<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Bombadilâ€™s house before them, up, down, under hill. Behind it a steep<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">shoulder of the land lay grey and bare, and beyond that the dark shapes of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the Barrow-downs stalked away into the eastern night.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They all hurried forward, hobbits and ponies. Already half their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">weariness and all their fears had fallen from them. Hey! Come merry dol!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">rolled out the song to greet them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Hey! Come derry dol! Hop along, my hearties!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Hobbits! Ponies all! We are fond of parties.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Now let the fun begin! Let us sing together!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Then another clear voice, as young and as ancient as Spring, like the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">song of a glad water flowing down into the night from a bright morning in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the hills, came falling like silver to meet them:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Now let the song begin! Let us sing together<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Of sun, stars, moon and mist, rain and cloudy weather,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Light on the budding leaf, dew on the feather,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Wind on the open hill, bells on the heather,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Reeds by the shady pool, lilies on the water:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Old Tom Bombadil and the River-daughter!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And with that song the hobbits stood upon the threshold, and a golden<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">light was all about them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Chapter 7 . In the House of Tom Bombadil<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The four hobbits stepped over the wide stone threshold, and stood<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">still, blinking. They were in a long low room, filled with the light of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">lamps swinging from the beams of the roof; and on the table of dark polished<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">wood stood many candles, tall and yellow, burning brightly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In a chair, at the far side of the room facing the outer door, sat a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">woman. Her long yellow hair rippled down her shoulders; her gown was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">green,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">green as young reeds, shot with silver like beads of dew; and her belt was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of gold, shaped like a chain of flag-lilies set with the pale-blue eyes of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">forget-me-nots. About her feel in wide vessels of green and brown<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">earthenware, white water-lilies were floating, so that she seemed to be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">enthroned in the midst of a pool.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">â€™Enter, good guests!' she said, and as she spoke they knew that it was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">her clear voice they had heard singing. They came a few timid steps further<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">into the room, and began to bow low, feeling strangely surprised and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">awkward, like folk that, knocking at a cottage door to beg for a drink of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">water, have been answered by a fair young elf-queen clad in living flowers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But before they could say anything, she sprang lightly up and over the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">lily -bowls, and ran laughing towards them; and as she ran her gown rustled<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">softly like the wind in the flowering borders of a river.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">â€™Come dear folk!' she said, taking Frodo by the hand. Faugh and be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">merry! I am Goldberry, daughter of the River.' Then lightly she passed them<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and closing the door she turned her back to it, with her white arms spread<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">out across it. 'Let us shut out the night!' she said. 'For you are still<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">afraid, perhaps, of mist and tree-shadows and deep water, and untame things.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fear nothing! For tonight you are under the roof of Tom Bombadil.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The hobbits looked at her in wonder; and she looked at each of them and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">smiled. 'Fair lady Goldberry!' said Frodo at last, feeling his heart moved<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">with a joy that he did not understand. He stood as he had at times stood<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">enchanted by fair el ven- voices; but the spell that was now laid upon him was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">different: less keen and lofty was the delight, but deeper and nearer to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">mortal heart; marvellous and yet not strange. 'Fair lady Goldberry!' he said<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">again. 'Now the joy that was hidden in the songs we heard is made plain to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">me.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">O slender as a willow-wand! O clearer than clear water !<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">O reed by the living pool! Fair River-daughter!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">O spring-time and summer-time, and spring again after!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">O wind on the waterfall, and the leaves' laughter!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Suddenly he stopped and stammered, overcome with surprise to hear<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">himself saying such things. But Goldberry laughed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Welcome!' she said. 'I had not heard that folk of the Shire were so<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">sweet -tongued. But I see you are an elf-friend; the light in your eyes and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the ring in your voice tells it. This is a merry meeting! Sit now, and wait<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">for the Master of the house! He will not be long. He is tending your tired<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">beasts.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The hobbits sat down gladly in low rush-seated chairs, while Goldberry<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">busied herself about the table; and their eyes followed her, for the slender<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">grace of her movement filled them with quiet delight. From somewhere behind<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the house came the sound of singing. Every now and again they caught, among<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">many a derry dol and a merry dol and a ring a ding dillo the repeated words:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Old Tom Bombadil is a merry fellow;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Bright blue his jacket is, and his boots are yellow.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Fair lady!' said Frodo again after a while. 'Tell me, if my asking<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">does not seem foolish, who is Tom Bombadil?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'He is,' said Goldberry, staying her swift movements and smiling.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Frodo looked at her questioningly. 'He is, as you have seen him,' she<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">said in answer to his look. 'He is the Master of wood, water, and hill.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Then all this strange land belongs to him?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'No indeed!' she answered, and her smile faded. 'That would indeed be a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">burden,' she added in a low voice, as if to herself. 'The trees and the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">grasses and all things growing or living in the land belong each to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">themselves. Tom Bombadil is the Master. No one has ever caught old Tom<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">walking in the forest, wading in the water, leaping on the hill-tops under<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">light and shadow. He has no fear. Tom Bombadil is master.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A door opened and in came Tom Bombadil. He had now no hat and his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">thick<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">brown hair was crowned with autumn leaves. He laughed, and going to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Goldberry, took her hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Here's my pretty lady!' he said, bowing to the hobbits. 'Here's my<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Goldberry clothed all in silver -green with flowers in her girdle! Is the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">table laden? I see yellow cream and honeycomb, and white bread, and butter;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">milk, cheese, and green herbs and ripe berries gathered. Is that enough for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">us? Is the supper ready?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'It is,' said Goldberry; 'but the guests perhaps are not?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tom clapped his hands and cried: 'Tom, Tom! your guests are tired, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">you had near forgotten! Come now, my merry friends, and Tom will refresh<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">you! You shall clean grimy hands, and wash your weary faces; cast off your<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">muddy cloaks and comb out your tangles!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He opened the door, and they followed him down a short passage and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">round a sharp turn. They came to a low room with a sloping roof (a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">penthouse, it seemed, built on to the north end of the house). Its walls<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">were of clean stone, but they were mostly covered with green hanging mats<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and yellow curtains. The floor was flagged, and strewn with fresh green<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">rushes. There were four deep mattresses, each piled with white blankets,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">laid on the floor along one side. Against the opposite wall was a long bench<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">laden with wide earthenware basins, and beside it stood brown ewers filled<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">with water, some cold, some steaming hot. There were soft green slippers set<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">ready beside each bed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Before long, washed and refreshed, the hobbits were seated at the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">table, two on each side, while at either end sat Goldberry and the Master.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It was a long and merry meal. Though the hobbits ate, as only famished<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">hobbits can eat, there was no lack. The drink in their drinking -bowls seemed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to be clear cold water, yet it went to their hearts like wine and set free<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">their voices. The guests became suddenly aware that they were singing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">merrily, as if it was easier and more natural than talking.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At last Tom and Goldberry rose and cleared the table swiftly. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">guests were commanded to sit quiet, and were set in chairs, each with a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">footstool to his tired feet. There was a fire in the wide hearth before<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">them, and it was burning with a sweet smell, as if it were built of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">apple-wood. When everything was set in order, all the lights in the room<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">were put out, except one lamp and a pair of candles at each end of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">chimney-shelf. Then Goldberry came and stood before them, holding a candle;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and she wished them each a good night and deep sleep.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Have peace now,' she said, 'until the morning! Heed no nightly noises!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For nothing passes door and window here save moonlight and starlight and the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">wind off the hill-top. Good night!' She passed out of the room with a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">glimmer and a rustle. The sound of her footsteps was like a stream falling<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">gently away downhill over cool stones in the quiet of night.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tom sat on a while beside them in silence, while each of them tried to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">muster the courage to ask one of the many questions he had meant to ask at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">supper. Sleep gathered on their eyelids. At last Frodo spoke:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Did you hear me calling, Master, or was it just chance that brought<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">you at that moment?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tom stirred like a man shaken out of a pleasant dream. 'Eh, what?' said<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">he. 'Did I hear you calling? Nay, I did not hear: I was busy singing. Just<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">chance brought me then, if chance you call it. It was no plan of mine,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">though I was waiting for you. We heard news of you, and learned that you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">were wandering. We guessed you'd come ere long down to the water: all paths<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">lead that way, down to Withywindle. Old grey Willow-man, he's a mighty<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">singer; and it's hard for little folk to escape his cunning mazes. But Tom<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">had an errand there, that he dared not hinder.' Tom nodded as if sleep was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">taking him again; but he went on in a soft singing voice:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I had an errand there: gathering water-lilies,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">green leaves and lilies white to please my pretty lady,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the last ere the year's end to keep them from the winter,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to flower by her pretty feet tilt the snows are melted.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Each year at summer's end I go to find them for her,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">in a wide pool, deep and clear, far down Withywindle;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">there they open first in spring and there they linger latest.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By that pool long ago I found the River-daughter,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">fair young Goldberry sitting in the rushes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweet was her singing then, and her heart was beating!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He opened his eyes and looked at them with a sudden glint of blue:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And that proved well for you â€” for now I shall no longer<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">go down deep again along the forest-water,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">not while the year is old. Nor shall I be passing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Old Man Willow's house this side of spring-time,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">not till the merry spring, when the River-daughter<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">dances down the withy-path to bathe in the water.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He fell silent again; but Frodo could not help asking one more<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">question: the one he most desired to have answered. 'Tell us, Master,' he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">said, 'about the Willow-man. What is he? I have never heard of him before.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'No, don't!' said Merry and Pippin together, sitting suddenly upright.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Not now! Not until the morning!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That is right!' said the old man. 'Now is the time for resting. Some<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">things are ill to hear when the world's in shadow. Sleep till the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">morning -light, rest on the pillow ! Heed no nightly noise! Fear no grey<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">willow!' And with that he took down the lamp and blew it out, and grasping a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">candle in either hand he led them out of the room.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Their mattresses and pillows were soft as down, and the blankets were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of white wool. They had hardly laid themselves on the deep beds and drawn<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the light covers over them before they were asleep.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the dead night, Frodo lay in a dream without light. Then he saw the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">young moon rising; under its thin light there loomed before him a black wall<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of rock, pierced by a dark arch like a great gate. It seemed to Frodo that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">he was lifted up, and passing over he saw that the rock-wall was a circle of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">hills, and that within it was a plain, and in the midst of the plain stood a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">pinnacle of stone, like a vast tower but not made by hands. On its top stood<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the figure of a man. The moon as it rose seemed to hang for a moment above<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">his head and glistened in his white hair as the wind stirred it. Up from the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">dark plain below came the crying of fell voices, and the howling of many<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">wolves. Suddenly a shadow, like the shape of great wings, passed across the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">moon. The figure lifted his arms and a light flashed from the staff that he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">wielded. A mighty eagle swept down and bore him away. The voices wailed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the wolves yammered. There was a noise like a strong wind blowing, and on it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">was borne the sound of hoofs, galloping, galloping, galloping from the East.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Black Riders!' thought Frodo as he wakened, with the sound of the hoofs<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">still echoing in his mind. He wondered if he would ever again have the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">courage to leave the safety of these stone walls. He lay motionless, still<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">listening; but all was now silent, and at last he turned and fell asleep<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">again or wandered into some other unremembered dream.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At his side Pippin lay dreaming pleasantly; but a change came over his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">dreams and he turned and groaned. Suddenly he woke, or thought he had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">waked,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and yet still heard in the darkness the sound that had disturbed his dream:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">tip-tap, squeak : the noise was like branches fretting in the wind,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">twig-fingers scraping wall and window: creak, creak, creak. He wondered if<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">there were willow-trees close to the house; and then suddenly he had a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">dreadful feeling that he was not in an ordinary house at all, but inside the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">willow and listening to that horrible dry creaking voice laughing at him<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">again. He sat up, and felt the soft pillows yield to his hands, and he lay<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">down again relieved. He seemed to hear the echo of words in his ears: â€™Fear<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">nothing! Have peace until the morning! Heed no nightly noises!' Then he went<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to sleep again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It was the sound of water that Merry heard falling into his quiet<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">sleep: water streaming down gently, and then spreading, spreading<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">irresistibly all round the house into a dark shoreless pool. It gurgled<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">under the walls, and was rising slowly but surely. 'I shall be drowned!' he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">thought. It will find its way in, and then I shall drown.' He felt that he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">was lying in a soft slimy bog, and springing up he set his fool on the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">corner of a cold hard flagstone. Then he remembered where he was and lay<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">down again. He seemed to hear or remember hearing: 'Nothing passes doors or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">windows save moonlight and starlight and the wind off the hill-top.' A<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">little breath of sweet air moved the curtain. He breathed deep and fell<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">asleep again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As far as he could remember, Sam slept through the night in deep<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">content, if logs are contented.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They woke up, all four at once, in the morning light. Tom was moving<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">about the room whistling like a starling. When he heard them stir he clapped<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">his hands, and cried: 'Hey! Come merry dol! derry dol! My hearties!' He drew<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">back the yellow curtains, and the hobbits saw that these had covered the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">windows, at either end of the room, one looking east and the other looking<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">west.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They leapt up refreshed. Frodo ran to the eastern window, and found<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">himself looking into a kitchen-garden grey with dew. He had half expected to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">see turf right up to the walls, turf all pocked with hoof-prints. Actually<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">his view was screened by a tall line of beans on poles; but above and far<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">beyond them the grey top of the hill loomed up against the sunrise. It was a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">pale morning: in the East, behind long clouds like lines of soiled wool<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">stained red at the edges, lay glimmering deeps of yellow. The sky spoke of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">rain to come; but the light was broadening quickly, and the red flowers on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the beans began to glow against the wet green leaves.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Pippin looked out of the western window, down into a pool of mist. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Forest was hidden under a fog. It was like looking down on to a sloping<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">cloud-roof from above. There was a fold or channel where the mist was broken<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">into many plumes and billows; the valley of the Withywindle. The stream ran<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">down the hill on the left and vanished into the white shadows. Near at hand<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">was a flower-garden and a clipped hedge silver -netted, and beyond that grey<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">shaven grass pale with dew-drops. There was no willow-tree to be seen.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Good morning, merry friends!' cried Tom, opening the eastern window<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">wide. A cool air flowed in; it had a rainy smell. 'Sun won't show her face<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">much today. I'm thinking. I have been walking wide, leaping on the hilltops,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">since the grey dawn began, nosing wind and weather, wet grass underfoot, wet<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">sky above me. I wakened Goldberry singing under window; but nought<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">wakes<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">hobbit-folk in the early morning. In the night little folk wake up in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">darkness, and sleep after light has come! Ring a ding dillo! Wake now, my<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">merry friends! Forget the nightly noises! Ring a ding dillo del! derry del,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">my hearties! If you come soon you'll find breakfast on the table. If you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">come late you'll get grass and rain-water!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Needless to say - not that Tom's threat sounded very serious - the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">hobbits came soon, and left the table late and only when it was beginning lo<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">look rather empty. Neither Tom nor Goldberry were there. Tom could be heard<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">about the house, clattering in the kitchen, and up and down the stairs, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">singing here and there outside. The room looked westward over the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">mist-clouded valley, and the window was open. Water dripped down from the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">thatched eaves above. Before they had finished breakfast the clouds had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">joined into an unbroken roof, and a straight grey rain came softly and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">steadily down. Behind its deep curtain the Forest was completely veiled.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As they looked out of the window there came falling gently as if it was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">flowing down the rain out of the sky, the clear voice of Goldberry singing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">up above them. They could hear few words, but it seemed plain to them that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the song was a rain-song, as sweet as showers on dry hills, that told the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">tale of a river from the spring in the highlands to the Sea far below. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">hobbits listened with delight; and Frodo was glad in his heart, and blessed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the kindly weather, because it delayed them from departing. The thought of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">going had been heavy upon him from the moment he awoke; but he guessed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">now<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that they would not go further that day.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The upper wind settled in the West and deeper and wetter clouds rolled<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">up to spill their laden rain on the bare heads of the Downs. Nothing could<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">be seen all round the house but falling water. Frodo stood near the open<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">door and watched the white chalky path turn into a little river of milk and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">go bubbling away down into the valley. Tom Bombadil came trotting round<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">corner of the house, waving his arms as if he was warding off the rain - and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">indeed when he sprang over the threshold he seemed quite dry, except for his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">boots. These he took off and put in the chimney-corner. Then he sat in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">largest chair and called the hobbits to gather round him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is Goldberry's washing day,' he said, â€™and her autumn-cleaning.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Too wet for hobbit-folk - let them rest while they are able! Itâ€™s a good day<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">for long tales, for questions and for answers, so Tom will start the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">talking.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He then told them many remarkable stories, sometimes half as if<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">speaking to himself, sometimes looking at them suddenly with a bright blue<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">eye under his deep brows. Often his voice would turn to song, and he would<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">get out of his chair and dance about. He told them tales of bees and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">flowers, the ways of trees, and the strange creatures of the Forest, about<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the evil things and good things, things friendly and things unfriendly,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">cruel things and kind things, and secrets hidden under brambles.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As they listened, they began to understand the lives of the Forest,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">apart from themselves, indeed to feel themselves as the strangers where all<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">other things were at home. Moving constantly in and out of his talk was Old<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Man Willow, and Frodo learned now enough to content him, indeed more<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">than<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">enough, for it was not comfortable lore. Tomâ€™s words laid bare the hearts of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">trees and their thoughts, which were often dark and strange, and filled with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">a hatred of things that go free upon the earth, gnawing, biting, breaking,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">hacking, burning: destroyers and usurpers. It was not called the Old Forest<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">without reason, for it was indeed ancient, a survivor of vast forgotten<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">woods; and in it there lived yet, ageing no quicker than the hills, the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">fathers of the fathers of trees, remembering times when they were lords. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">countless years had filled them with pride and rooted wisdom, and with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">malice. But none were more dangerous than the Great Willow: his heart was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">rotten, but his strength was green; and he was cunning, and a master of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">winds, and his song and thought ran through the woods on both sides of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">river. His grey thirsty spirit drew power out of the earth and spread like<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">fine root-threads in the ground, and invisible twig-fingers in the air, till<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">it had under its dominion nearly all the trees of the Forest from the Hedge<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to the Downs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Suddenly Tomâ€™s talk left the woods and went leaping up the young<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">stream, over bubbling waterfalls, over pebbles and worn rocks, and among<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">small flowers in close grass and wet crannies, wandering at last up on to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the Downs. They heard of the Great Barrows, and the green mounds, and the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">stone-rings upon the hills and in the hollows among the hills. Sheep were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">bleating in flocks. Green walls and white walls rose. There were fortresses<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">on the heights. Kings of little kingdoms fought together, and the young Sun<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">shone like fire on the red metal of their new and greedy swords. There was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">victory and defeat; and towers fell, fortresses were burned, and flames went<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">up into the sky. Gold was piled on the biers of dead kings and queens; and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">mounds covered them, and the stone doors were shut; and the grass grew over<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">all. Sheep walked for a while biting the grass, but soon the hills were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">empty again. A shadow came out of dark places far away, and the bones were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">stirred in the mounds. Barrow- wights walked in the hollow places with a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">clink of rings on cold fingers, and gold chains in the wind.' Stone rings<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">grinned out of the ground like broken teeth in the moonlight.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The hobbits shuddered. Even in the Shire the rumour of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Barrow- wights of the Barrow-downs beyond the Forest had been heard. But it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">was not a tale that any hobbit liked to listen to, even by a comfortable<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">fireside far away. These four now suddenly remembered what the joy of this<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">house had driven from their minds: the house of Tom Bombadil nestled under<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the very shoulder of those dreaded hills. They lost the thread of his tale<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and shifted uneasily, looking aside at one another.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When they caught his words again they found that he had now wandered<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">into strange regions beyond their memory and beyond their waking thought,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">into limes when the world was wider, and the seas flowed straight to the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">western Shore; and still on and back Tom went singing out into ancient<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">starlight, when only the Elf-sires were awake. Then suddenly he slopped, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">they saw that he nodded as if he was falling asleep. The hobbits sat still<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">before him, enchanted; and it seemed as if, under the spell of his words,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the wind had gone, and the clouds had dried up, and the day had been<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">withdrawn, and darkness had come from East and West, and all the sky was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">filled with the light of white stars.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Whether the morning and evening of one day or of many days had passed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Frodo could not tell. Ele did not feel either hungry or tired, only filled<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">with wonder. The stars shone through the window and the silence of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">heavens seemed to be round him. He spoke at last out of his wonder and a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">sudden fear of that silence:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">â€™Who are you, Master?' he asked.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">â€™Eh, what?' said Tom sitting up, and his eyes glinting in the gloom.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Don't you know my name yet? That's the only answer. Tell me, who are you,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">alone, yourself and nameless? But you are young and I am old. Eldest, that's<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">what I am. Mark my words, my friends: Tom was here before the river and the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">trees; Tom remembers the first raindrop and the first acorn. He made paths<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">before the Big People, and saw the little People arriving. He was here<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">before the Kings and the graves and the Barrow- wights. When the Elves passed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">westward, Tom was here already, before the seas were bent. He knew the dark<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">under the stars when it was fearless - before the Dark Lord came from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Outside.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A shadow seemed to pass by the window, and the hobbits glanced hastily<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">through the panes. When they turned again, Goldberry stood in the door<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">behind, framed in light. She held a candle, shielding its flame from the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">draught with her hand; and the light flowed through it, like sunlight<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">through a white shell.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'The rain has ended,' she said; 'and new waters are running downhill,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">under the stars. Let us now laugh and be glad!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'And let us have food and drink!' cried Tom. 'Long tales are thirsty.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And long listening's hungry work, morning, noon, and evening!' With that he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">jumped out of his chair, and with a bound took a candle from the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">chimney-shelf and lit it in the flame that Goldberry held; then he danced<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">about the table. Suddenly he hopped through the door and disappeared.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Quickly he returned, bearing a large and laden tray. Then Tom and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Goldberry set the table; and the hobbits sat half in wonder and half in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">laughter: so fair was the grace of Goldberry and so merry and odd the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">caperings of Tom. Yet in some fashion they seemed to weave a single dance,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">neither hindering the other, in and out of the room, and round about the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">table; and with great speed food and vessels and lights were set in order.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The boards blazed with candles, white and yellow. Tom bowed to his guests.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Supper is ready,' said Goldberry; and now the hobbits saw that she was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">clothed all in silver with a white girdle, and her shoes were like fishes'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">mail. But Tom was all in clean blue, blue as rain-washed forget-me-nots, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">he had green stockings.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It was a supper even better than before. The hobbits under the spell of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tom's words may have missed one meal or many, but when the food was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">before<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">them it seemed at least a week since they had eaten. They did not sing or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">even speak much for a while, and paid close attention to business. But after<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">a time their hearts and spirit rose high again, and their voices rang out in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">mirth and laughter.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After they had eaten, Goldberry sang many songs for them, songs that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">began merrily in the hills and fell softly down into silence; and in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">silences they saw in their minds pools and waters wider than any they had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">known, and looking into them they saw the sky below them and the stars like<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">jewels in the depths. Then once more she wished them each good night and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">left them by the fireside. But Tom now seemed wide awake and plied them<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">questions.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He appeared already to know much about them and all their families, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">indeed to know much of all the history and doings of the Shire down from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">days hardly remembered among the hobbits themselves. It no longer surprised<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">them; but he made no secret that he owed his recent knowledge largely to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Farmer Maggot, whom he seemed to regard as a person of more importance<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">than<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">they had imagined. 'There's earth under his old feet, and clay on his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">fingers; wisdom in his bones, and both his eyes are open,' said Tom. It was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">also clear that Tom had dealings with the Elves, and it seemed that in some<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">fashion, news had reached him from Gildor concerning the flight of Frodo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Indeed so much did Tom know, and so cunning was his questioning, that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Frodo found himself telling him more about Bilbo and his own hopes and fears<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">than he had told before even to Gandalf. Tom wagged his head up and down,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and there was a glint in his eyes when he heard of the Riders.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Show me the precious Ring!' he said suddenly in the midst of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">story: and Frodo, to his own astonishment, drew out the chain from his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">pocket, and unfastening the Ring handed it at once to Tom.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It seemed to grow larger as it lay for a moment on his big<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">brown-skinned hand. Then suddenly he put it to his eye and laughed. For a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">second the hobbits had a vision, both comical and alarming, of his bright<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">blue eye gleaming through a circle of gold. Then Tom put the Ring round the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">end of his little finger and held it up to the candlelight. For a moment the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">hobbits noticed nothing strange about this. Then they gasped. There was no<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">sign of Tom disappearing!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tom laughed again, and then he spun the Ring in the air - and it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">vanished with a flash. Frodo gave a cry - and Tom leaned forward and handed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">it back to him with a smile.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Frodo looked at it closely, and rather suspiciously (like one who has<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">lent a trinket to a juggler). It was the same Ring, or looked the same and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">weighed the same: for that Ring had always seemed to Frodo to weigh<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">strangely heavy in the hand. But something prompted him to make sure. He<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">perhaps a trifle annoyed with Tom for seeming to make so light of what even<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Gandalf thought so perilously important. He waited for an opportunity, when<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the talk was going again, and Tom was telling an absurd story about badgers<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and their queer ways - then he slipped the Ring on.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Merry turned towards him to say something and gave a start, and checked<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">an exclamation. Frodo was delighted (in a way): it was his own ring all<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">right, for Merry was staring blankly at his chair, and obviously could not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">see him. He got up and crept quietly away from the fireside towards the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">outer door.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Hey there!' cried Tom, glancing towards him with a most seeing look in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">his shining eyes. 'Hey! Come Frodo, there! Where be you a-going? Old Tom<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Bombadil's not as blind as that yet. Take off your golden ring! Your hand's<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">more fair without it. Come back! Leave your game and sit down beside me!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">must talk a while more, and think about the morning. Tom must teach the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">right road, and keep your feet from wandering.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Frodo laughed (trying to feel pleased), and taking off the Ring he came<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and sat down again. Tom now told them that he reckoned the Sun would shine<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">tomorrow, and it would be a glad morning, and setting out would be hopeful.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But they would do well to start early; for weather in that country was a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">thing that even Tom could not be sure of for long, and it would change<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">sometimes quicker than he could change his jacket. 'I am no weather-master,'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">he said; 'nor is aught that goes on two legs.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By his advice they decided to make nearly due North from his house,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">over the western and lower slopes of the Downs: they might hope in that way<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to strike the East Road in a day's journey, and avoid the Barrows. He told<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">them not to be afraid - but to mind their own business.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Keep to the green grass. Don't you go a-meddling with old stone or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">cold Wights or prying in their houses, unless you be strong folk with hearts<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that never falter!' He said this more than once; and he advised them to pass<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">barrows by on the west-side, if they chanced to stray near one. Then he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">taught them a rhyme to sing, if they should by ill-luck fall into any danger<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">or difficulty the next day.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ho! Tom Bombadil, Tom Bombadillo!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By fire, sun and moon, harken now and hear us!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Come, Tom Bombadil, for our need is near us!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When they had sung this altogether after him, he clapped them each on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the shoulder with a laugh, and taking candles led them back to their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That night they heard no noises. But either in his dreams or out of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">them, he could not tell which, Frodo heard a sweet singing running in his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">mind; a song that seemed to come like a pale light behind a grey<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">rain-curtain, and growing stronger to turn the veil all to glass and silver,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">until at last it was rolled back, and a far green country opened before him<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">under a swift sunrise.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The vision melted into waking; and there was Tom whistling like a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">tree-full of birds; and the sun was already slanting down the hill and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">through the open window. Outside everything was green and pale gold.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After breakfast, which they again ate alone, they made ready to say<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">farewell, as nearly heavy of heart as was possible on such a morning: cool,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">bright, and clean under a washed autumn sky of thin blue. The air came fresh<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">from the North-west. Their quiet ponies were almost frisky, sniffing and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">moving restlessly. Tom came out of the house and waved his hat and danced<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">upon the doorstep, bidding the hobbits to get up and be off and go with good<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">speed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They rode off along a path that wound away from behind the house, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">went slanting up towards the north end of the hill -brow under which it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">sheltered. They had just dismounted to lead their ponies up the last steep<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">slope, when suddenly Frodo stopped.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Goldberry!' he cried. 'My fair lady, clad all in silver green! We have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">never said farewell to her, nor seen her since the evening!' He was so<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">distressed that he turned back; but at that moment a clear call came<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">rippling down. There on the hill-brow she stood beckoning to them: her hair<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">was flying loose, and as it caught the sun it shone and shimmered. A light<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">like the glint of water on dewy grass flashed from under her feet as she<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">danced.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They hastened up the last slope, and stood breathless beside her. They<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">bowed, but with a wave of her arm she bade them look round; and they looked<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">out from the hill-top over lands under the morning. It was now as clear and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">far-seen as it had been veiled and misty when they stood upon the knoll in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the Forest, which could now be seen rising pale and green out of the dark<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">trees in the West. In that direction the land rose in wooded ridges, green,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">yellow, russet under the sun, beyond which lay hidden the valley of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Brandywine. To the South, over the line of the Withywindle, there was a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">distant glint like pale glass where the Brandywine River made a great loop<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">in the lowlands and flowed away out of the knowledge of the hobbits.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Northward beyond the dwindling downs the land ran away in flats and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">swellings of grey and green and pale earth -colours, until it faded into a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">featureless and shadowy distance. Eastward the Barrow-downs rose, ridge<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">behind ridge into the morning, and vanished out of eyesight into a guess: it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">was no more than a guess of blue and a remote white glimmer blending with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the hem of the sky, but it spoke to them, out of memory and old tales, of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the high and distant mountains.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They took a deep draught of the air, and felt that a skip and a few<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">stout strides would bear them wherever they wished. It seemed fainthearted<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to go jogging aside over the crumpled skirts of the downs towards the Road,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">when they should be leaping, as lusty as Tom, over the stepping stones of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the hills straight towards the Mountains.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Goldberry spoke to them and recalled their eyes and thoughts. â€™Speed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">now, fair guests!â€™ she said. 'And hold to your purpose! North with the wind<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">in the left eye and a blessing on your footsteps! Make haste while the Sun<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">shines!' And to Frodo she said: 'Farewell, Elf-friend, it was a merry<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">meeting!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But Frodo found no words to answer. He bowed low, and mounted his pony,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and followed by his friends jogged slowly down the gentle slope behind the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">hill. Tom Bombadil's house and the valley, and the Forest were lost to view.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The air grew warmer between the green walls of hillside and hillside, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the scent of turf rose strong and sweet as they breathed. Turning back, when<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">they reached the bottom of the green hollow, they saw Goldberry, now small<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and slender like a sunlit flower against the sky: she was standing still<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">watching them, and her hands were stretched out towards them. As they looked<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">she gave a clear call, and lifting up her hand she turned and vanished<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">behind the hill .<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Their way wound along the floor of the hollow, and round the green feet<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of a steep hill into another deeper and broader valley, and then over the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">shoulder of further hills, and down their long limbs, and up their smooth<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">sides again, up on to new hill-tops and down into new valleys. There was no<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">tree nor any visible water: it was a country of grass and short springy<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">turf, silent except for the whisper of the air over the edges of the land,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and high lonely cries of strange birds. As they journeyed the sun mounted,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and grew hot. Each time they climbed a ridge the breeze seemed to have grown<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">less. When they caught a glimpse of the country westward the distant Forest<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">seemed to be smoking, as if the fallen rain was steaming up again from leaf<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and root and mould. A shadow now lay round the edge of sight, a dark haze<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">above which the upper sky was like a blue cap, hot and heavy.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">About mid-day they came to a hill whose top was wide and flattened,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">like a shallow saucer with a green mounded rim. Inside there was no air<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">stirring, and the sky seemed near their heads. They rode across and looked<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">northwards. Then their hearts rose, for it seemed plain that they had come<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">further already than they had expected. Certainly the distances had now all<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">become hazy and deceptive, but there could be no doubt that the Downs were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">coming to an end. A long valley lay below them winding away northwards,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">until it came to an opening between two steep shoulders. Beyond, there<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">seemed to be no more hills. Due north they faintly glimpsed a long dark<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">line. That is a line of trees,' said Merry, 'and that must mark the Road.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All along it for many leagues east of the Bridge there are trees growing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some say they were planted in the old days.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Splendid!' said Frodo. 'If we make as good going this afternoon as we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">have done this morning, we shall have left the Downs before the Sun sets and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">be jogging on in search of a camping place.' But even as he spoke he turned<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">his glance eastwards, and he saw that on that side the hills were higher and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">looked down upon them; and all those hills were crowned with green mounds,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and on some were standing stones, pointing upwards like jagged teeth out of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">green gums.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That view was somehow disquieting; so they turned from the sight and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">went down into the hollow circle. In the midst of it there stood a single<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">stone, standing tall under the sun above, and at this hour casting no<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">shadow. It was shapeless and yet significant: like a landmark, or a guarding<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">finger, or more like a warning. But they were now hungry, and the sun was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">still at the fearless noon; so they set their backs against the east side of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the stone. It was cool, as if the sun had had no power to warm it; but at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that time this seemed pleasant. There they took food and drink, and made as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">good a noon-meal under the open sky as anyone could wish; for the food came<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">from 'down under Hill'. Tom had provided them with plenty for the comfort of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the day. Their ponies unburdened strayed upon the grass.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Riding over the hills, and eating their fill, the warm sun and the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">scent of turf, lying a little too long, stretching out their legs and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">looking at the sky above their noses: these things are, perhaps, enough to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">explain what happened. However, that may be: they woke suddenly and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">uncomfortably from a sleep they had never meant to take. The standing stone<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">was cold, and it cast a long pale shadow that stretched eastward over them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The sun, a pale and watery yellow, was gleaming through the mist just above<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the west wall of the hollow in which they lay; north, south, and east,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">beyond the wall the fog was thick, cold and white. The air was silent, heavy<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and chill. Their ponies were standing crowded together with their heads<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">down.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The hobbits sprang to their feet in alarm, and ran to the western rim.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They found that they were upon an island in the fog. Even as they looked out<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">in dismay towards the setting sun, it sank before their eyes into a white<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">sea, and a cold grey shadow sprang up in the East behind. The fog rolled up<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to the walls and rose above them, and as it mounted it bent over their heads<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">until it became a roof: they were shut in a hall of mist whose central<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">pillar was the standing stone.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They felt as if a trap was closing about them; but they did not quite<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">lose heart. They still remembered the hopeful view they had had of the line<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of the Road ahead, and they still knew in which direction it lay. In any<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">case, they now had so great a dislike for that hollow place about the stone<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that no thought of remaining there was in their minds. They packed up as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">quickly as their chilled fingers would work.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Soon they were leading their ponies in single file over the rim and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">down the long northward slope of the hill, down into a foggy sea. As they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">went down the mist became colder and damper, and their hair hung lank and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">dripping on their foreheads. When they reached the bottom it was so cold<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that they halted and got out cloaks and hoods, which soon became bedewed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">with grey drops. Then, mounting their ponies, they went slowly on again,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">feeling their way by the rise and fall of the ground. They were steering, as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">well as they could guess, for the gate-like opening at the far northward end<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of the long valley which they had seen in the morning. Once they were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">through the gap, they had only lo keep on in anything like a straight line<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and they were bound in the end to strike the Road. Their thoughts did not go<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">beyond that, except for a vague hope that perhaps away beyond the Downs<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">there might be no fog.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Their going was very slow. To prevent their getting separated and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">wandering in different directions they went in file, with Frodo leading. Sam<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">was behind him, and after him came Pippin, and then Merry. The valley<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">seemed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to stretch on endlessly. Suddenly Frodo saw a hopeful sign. On either side<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">ahead a darkness began to loom through the mist; and he guessed that they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">were at last approaching the gap in the hills, the north-gate of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Barrow-downs. If they could pass that, they would be free.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Come on! Follow me!' he called back over his shoulder, and he hurried<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">forward. But his hope soon changed to bewilderment and alarm. The dark<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">patches grew darker, but they shrank; and suddenly he saw, towering ominous<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">before him and leaning slightly towards one another like the pillars of a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">headless door, two huge standing stones. He could not remember having seen<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">any sign of these in the valley, when he looked out from the hill in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">morning. He had passed between them almost before he was aware: and even<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">he did so darkness seemed to fall round him. His pony reared and snorted,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and he fell off. When he looked back he found that he was alone: the others<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">had not followed him. 'Sam!' he called. 'Pippin! Merry! Come along! Why<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">don't you keep up?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There was no answer. Fear took him, and he ran back past the stones<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">shouting wildly: 'Sam! Sam! Merry! Pippin!' The pony bolted into the mist<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and vanished. From some way off, or so it seemed, he thought he heard a cry:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Hoy! Frodo! Hoy!' It was away eastward, on his left as he stood under the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">great stones, staring and straining into the gloom. He plunged off in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">direction of the call, and found himself going steeply uphill.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As he struggled on he called again, and kept on calling more and more<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">frantically; but he heard no answer for some time, and then it seemed faint<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and far ahead and high above him. 'Frodo! Hoy!' came the thin voices out of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the mist: and then a cry that sounded like help, help! often repeated,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">ending with a last help! that trailed off into a long wail suddenly cut<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">short. He stumbled forward with all the speed he could towards the cries;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">but the light was now gone, and clinging night had closed about him, so that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">it was impossible to be sure of any direction. He seemed all the time to be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">climbing up and up.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Only the change in the level of the ground at his feet told him when he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">at last came to the top of a ridge or hill. He was weary, sweating and yet<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">chilled. It was wholly dark.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Where are you?' he cried out miserably.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There was no reply. He stood listening. He was suddenly aware that it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">was getting very cold, and that up here a wind was beginning to blow, an icy<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">wind. A change was coming in the weather. The mist was flowing past him<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">now<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">in shreds and tatters. His breath was smoking, and the darkness was less<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">near and thick. He looked up and saw with surprise that faint stars were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">appearing overhead amid the strands of hurrying cloud and fog. The wind<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">began to hiss over the grass.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He imagined suddenly that he caught a muffled cry, and he made towards<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">it; and even as he went forward the mist was rolled up and thrust aside, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the starry sky was unveiled. A glance showed him that he was now facing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">southwards and was on a round hill-top, which he must have climbed from the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">north. Out of the east the biting wind was blowing. To his right there<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">loomed against the westward stars a dark black shape. A great barrow stood<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">there.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">â€™Where are you?' he cried again, both angry and afraid.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Here!' said a voice, deep and cold, that seemed to come out of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">ground. 'I am waiting for you!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'No!' said Frodo; but he did not run away. His knees gave, and he fell<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">on the ground. Nothing happened, and there was no sound. Trembling he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">looked<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">up, in time to see a tall dark figure like a shadow against the stars. It<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">leaned over him. He thought there were two eyes, very cold though lit with a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">pale light that seemed to come from some remote distance. Then a grip<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">stronger and colder than iron seized him. The icy touch froze his bones, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">he remembered no more.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When he came to himself again, for a moment he could recall nothing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">except a sense of dread. Then suddenly he knew that he was imprisoned,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">caught hopelessly; he was in a barrow. A Barrow-wight had taken him, and he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">was probably already under the dreadful spells of the Barrow- wights about<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">which whispered tales spoke. He dared not move, but lay as he found himself:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">flat on his back upon a cold stone with his hands on his breast.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But though his fear was so great that it seemed to be part of the very<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">darkness that was round him, he found himself as he lay thinking about Bilbo<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Baggins and his stories, of their jogging along together in the lanes of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Shire and talking about roads and adventures. There is a seed of courage<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">hidden (often deeply, it is true) in the heart of the fattest and most timid<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">hobbit, wailing for some final and desperate danger to make it grow. Frodo<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">was neither very fat nor very timid; indeed, though he did not know it,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Bilbo (and Gandalf) had thought him the best hobbit in the Shire. He thought<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">he had come to the end of his adventure, and a terrible end, but the thought<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">hardened him. He found himself stiffening, as if for a final spring; he no<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">longer felt limp like a helpless prey.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As he lay there, thinking and getting a hold of himself, he noticed all<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">at once that the darkness was slowly giving way: a pale greenish light was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">growing round him. It did not at first show him what kind of a place he was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">in, for the light seemed to be coming out of himself, and from the floor<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">beside him, and had not yet reached the roof or wall. He turned, and there<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">in the cold glow he saw lying beside him Sam, Pippin, and Merry. They were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">on their backs, and their faces looked deathly pale; and they were clad in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">white. About them lay many treasures, of gold maybe, though in that light<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">they looked cold and unlovely. On their heads were circlets, gold chains<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">were about their waists, and on their fingers were many rings. Swords lay by<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">their sides, and shields were at their feet. But across their three necks<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">lay one long naked sword.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Suddenly a song began: a cold murmur, rising and falling. The voice<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">seemed far away and immeasurably dreary, sometimes high in the air and thin,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">sometimes like a low moan from the ground. Out of the formless stream of sad<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">but horrible sounds, strings of words would now and again shape themselves:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">grim, hard, cold words, heartless and miserable. The night was railing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">against the morning of which it was bereaved, and the cold was cursing the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">warmth for which it hungered. Frodo was chilled to the marrow. After a while<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the song became clearer, and with dread in his heart he perceived that it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">had changed into an incantation:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Cold be hand and heart and bone,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and cold be sleep under stone:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">never mare to wake on stony bed,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">never, till the Sun fails and the Moon is dead.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the black wind the stars shall die,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and still on gold here let them lie,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">till the dark lord lifts his hand<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">over dead sea and withered land.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He heard behind his head a creaking and scraping sound. Raising himself<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">on one arm he looked, and saw now in the pale light that they were in a kind<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of passage which behind them turned a corner. Round the corner a long arm<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">was groping, walking on its fingers towards Sam, who was lying nearest, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">towards the hilt of the sword that lay upon him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At first Frodo felt as if he had indeed been turned into stone by the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">incantation. Then a wild thought of escape came to him. He wondered if he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">put on the Ring, whether the Barrow-wight would miss him, and he might find<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">some way out. He thought of himself running free over the grass, grieving<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">for Merry, and Sam, and Pippin, but free and alive himself. Gandalf would<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">admit that there had been nothing else he could do.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But the courage that had been awakened in him was now too strong: he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">could not leave his friends so easily. He wavered, groping in his pocket,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and then fought with himself again; and as he did so the arm crept nearer.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Suddenly resolve hardened in him, and he seized a short sword that lay<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">beside him, and kneeling he stooped low over the bodies of his companions.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With what strength he had he hewed at the crawling arm near the wrist, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the hand broke off; but at the same moment the sword splintered up to the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">hilt. There was a shriek and the light vanished. In the dark there was a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">snarling noise.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Frodo fell forward over Merry, and Merry's face felt cold. All at once<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">back into his mind, from which it had disappeared with the first coming of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the fog, came the memory of the house down under the Hill, and of Tom<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">singing. He remembered the rhyme that Tom had taught them. In a small<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">desperate voice he began: Ho! Tom Bombadil! and with that name his voice<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">seemed to grow strong: it had a full and lively sound, and the dark chamber<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">echoed as if to drum and trumpet.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ho! Tom Bombadil, Tom Bombadillo!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By water, wood and hill, by the reed and willow,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By fire, sun and moon, harken now and hear us!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Come, Tom Bombadil, for our need is near us!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There was a sudden deep silence, in which Frodo could hear his heart<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">beating. After a long slow moment he heard plain, but far away, as if it was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">coming down through the ground or through thick walls, an answering voice<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">singing:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Old Tom Bombadil is a merry fellow,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Bright blue his jacket is, and his boots are yellow.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">None has ever caught him yet, for Tom, he is the master:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">His songs are stronger songs, and his feet are faster.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There was a loud rumbling sound, as of stones rolling and falling, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">suddenly light streamed in, real light, the plain light of day. A low<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">door -like opening appeared at the end of the chamber beyond Frodo's feet;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and there was Tom's head (hat, feather, and all) framed against the light of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the sun rising red behind him. The light fell upon the floor, and upon the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">faces of the three hobbits lying beside Frodo. They did not stir, but the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">sickly hue had left them. They looked now as if they were only very deeply<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">asleep.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tom stooped, removed his hat, and came into the dark chamber, singing:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Get out, you old Wight! Vanish in the sunlight!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Shrivel like the cold mist, like the winds go wailing,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Out into the barren lands far beyond the mountains!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Come never here again! Leave your barrow empty!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Lost and forgotten be, darker than the darkness,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Where gates stand for ever shut, till the world is mended.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At these words there was a cry and part of the inner end of the chamber<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">fell in with a crash. Then there was a long trailing shriek, fading away<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">into an unguessable distance; and after that silence.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">â€™Come, friend Frodo!' said Tom. 'Let us get out on to clean grass! You<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">must help me bear them.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Together they carried out Merry, Pippin, and Sam. As Frodo left the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">barrow for the last time he thought he saw a severed hand wriggling still,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">like a wounded spider, in a heap of fallen earth. Tom went back in again,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and there was a sound of much thumping and stamping. When he came out he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">bearing in his arms a great load of treasure: things of gold, silver,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">copper, and bronze; many beads and chains and jewelled ornaments. He<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">climbed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the green barrow and laid them all on top in the sunshine.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There he stood, with his hat in his hand and the wind in his hair, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">looked down upon the three hobbits, that had been laid on their backs upon<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the grass at the west side of the mound. Raising his right hand he said in a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">clear and commanding voice:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Wake now my merry tads! Wake and hear me calling!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Warm now be heart and limb! The cold stone is fallen;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dark door is standing wide; dead hand is broken.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Night under Night is flown, and the Gate is open!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To Frodoâ€™s great joy the hobbits stirred, stretched their arms, rubbed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">their eyes, and then suddenly sprang up. They looked about in amazement,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">first at Frodo, and then at Tom standing large as life on the barrow-top<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">above them; and then at themselves in their thin white rags, crowned and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">belted with pale gold, and jingling with trinkets.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'What in the name of wonder?' began Merry, feeling the golden circlet<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that had slipped over one eye. Then he stopped, and a shadow came over his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">face, and he closed his eyes. 'Of course, I remember!' he said. 'The men of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Carn Dym came on us at night, and we were worsted. Ah! the spear in my<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">heart!' He clutched at his breast. 'No! No!' he said, opening his eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'What am I saying? I have been dreaming. Where did you get to, Frodo?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'I thought that I was lost,' said Frodo; 'but I don't want to speak of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">it. Let us think of what we are to do now! Let us go on!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Dressed up like this, sir?' said Sam. 'Where are my clothes?' He flung<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">his circlet, belt, and rings on the grass, and looked round helplessly, as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">if he expected to find his cloak, jacket, and breeches, and other<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">hobbit-garments lying somewhere to hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'You won't find your clothes again,' said Tom, bounding down from the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">mound, and laughing as he danced round them in the sunlight. One would have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">thought that nothing dangerous or dreadful had happened; and indeed the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">horror faded out of their hearts as they looked at him, and saw the merry<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">glint in his eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'What do you mean?' asked Pippin, looking at him, half puzzled and half<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">amused. 'Why not?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But Tom shook his head, saying: 'You've found yourselves again, out of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the deep water. Clothes are but little loss, if you escape from drowning. Be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">glad, my merry friends, and let the warm sunlight heal now heart and limb!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Cast off these cold rags! Run naked on the grass, while Tom goes a-hunting!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He sprang away down hill, whistling and calling. Looking down after him<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Frodo saw him running away southwards along the green hollow between<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">hill and the next, still whistling and crying:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Hey! now! Come hoy now! Whither do you wander?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Up, down, near or far, here, there or yonder?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sharp-ears, Wise-nose, Swish-tail and Bumpkin,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">White-socks my little lad, and old Fatty Lumpkin!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So he sang, running fast, tossing up his hat and catching it, until he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">was hidden by a fold of the ground: but for some time his hey now! hoy now!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">came floating back down the wind, which had shifted round towards the south.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The air was growing very warm again. The hobbits ran about for a while<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">on the grass, as he told them. Then they lay basking in the sun with the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">delight of those that have been wafted suddenly from bitter winter to a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">friendly clime, or of people that, after being long ill and bedridden, wake<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">one day to find that they are unexpectedly well and the day is again full of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">promise.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By the time that Tom returned they were feeling strong (and hungry). He<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">reappeared, hat first, over the brow of the hill, and behind him came in an<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">obedient line six ponies: their own five and one more. The last was plainly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">old Fatty Lumpkin: he was larger, stronger, fatter (and older) than their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">own ponies. Merry, to whom the others belonged, had not, in fact, given them<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">any such names, but they answered to the new names that Tom had given<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">them<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">for the rest of their lives. Tom called them one by one and they climbed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">over the brow and stood in a line. Then Tom bowed to the hobbits.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Here are your ponies, now!' he said. 'They've more sense (in some<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">ways) than you wandering hobbits have - more sense in their noses. For they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">sniff danger ahead which you walk right into; and if they run to save<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">themselves, then they run the right way. You must forgive them all; for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">though their hearts are faithful, to face fear of Barrow- wights is not what<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">they were made for. See, here they come again, bringing all their burdens!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Merry, Sam, and Pippin now clothed themselves in spare garments from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">their packs; and they soon felt too hot, for they were obliged to put on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">some of the thicker and warmer things that they had brought against the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">oncoming of winter.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Where does that other old animal, that Fatty Lumpkin, come from?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">asked Frodo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'He's mine,' said Tom. 'My four-legged friend; though I seldom ride<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">him, and he wanders often far, free upon the hillsides. When your ponies<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">stayed with me, they got to know my Lumpkin; and they smelt him in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">night, and quickly ran to meet him. I thought he'd look for them and with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">his words of wisdom take all their fear away. But now, my jolly Lumpkin, old<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tom's going to ride. Hey! he's coming with you, just to set you on the road;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">so he needs a pony. For you cannot easily talk to hobbits that are riding,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">when you're on your own legs trying to trot beside them.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The hobbits were delighted to hear this, and thanked Tom many times;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">but he laughed, and said that they were so good at losing themselves that he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">would not feel happy till he had seen them safe over the borders of his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">land. Tve got things to do,' he said: 'my making and my singing, my<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">talking and my walking, and my watching of the country. Tom can't be always<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">near to open doors and willow-cracks. Tom has his house to mind, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Goldberry is waiting.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It was still fairly early by the sun, something between nine and ten,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and the hobbits turned their minds to food. Their last meal had been lunch<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">beside the standing stone the day before. They breakfasted now off the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">remainder of Tom's provisions, meant for their supper, with additions that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tom had brought with him. It was not a large meal (considering hobbits and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the circumstances), but they felt much better for it. While they were eating<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tom went up to the mound, and looked through the treasures. Most of these he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">made into a pile that glistened and sparkled on the grass. He bade them lie<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">there 'free to all finders, birds, beasts. Elves or Men, and all kindly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">creatures'; for so the spell of the mound should be broken and scattered and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">no Wight ever come back to it. He chose for himself from the pile a brooch<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">set with blue stones, many-shaded like flax-flowers or the wings of blue<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">butterflies. He looked long at it, as if stirred by some memory, shaking his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">head, and saying at last:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Here is a pretty toy for Tom and for his lady! Fair was she who long<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">ago wore this on her shoulder. Goldberry shall wear it now, and we will not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">forget her!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For each of the hobbits he chose a dagger, long, leaf-shaped, and keen,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of marvellous workmanship, damasked with serpent-forms in red and gold.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">gleamed as he drew them from their black sheaths, wrought of some strange<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">metal, light and strong, and set with many fiery stones. Whether by some<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">virtue in these sheaths or because of the spell that lay on the mound, the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">blades seemed untouched by time, unrusted, sharp, glittering in the sun.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Old knives are long enough as swords for hobbit-people,' he said.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Sharp blades are good to have, if Shire-folk go walking, east, south, or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">far away into dark and danger.' Then he told them that these blades were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">forged many long years ago by Men of Westernesse: they were foes of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dark<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Lord, but they were overcome by the evil king of Carn Dym in the Land of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Angmar.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Few now remember them,' Tom murmured, 'yet still some go wandering,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">sons of forgotten kings walking in loneliness, guarding from evil things<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">folk that are heedless.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The hobbits did not understand his words, but as he spoke they had a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">vision as it were of a great expanse of years behind them, like a vast<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">shadowy plain over which there strode shapes of Men, tall and grim with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">bright swords, and last came one with a star on his brow. Then the vision<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">faded, and they were back in the sunlit world. It was time to start again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They made ready, packing their bags and lading their ponies. Their new<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">weapons they hung on their leather belts under their jackets, feeling them<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">very awkward, and wondering if they would be of any use. Fighting had not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">before occurred to any of them as one of the adventures in which their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">flight would land them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At last they set off. They led their ponies down the hill; and then<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">mounting they trotted quickly along the valley. They looked back and saw the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">top of the old mound on the hill, and from it the sunlight on the gold went<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">up like a yellow flame. Then they turned a shoulder of the Downs and it was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">hidden from view.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Though Frodo looked about him on every side he saw no sign of the great<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">stones standing like a gate, and before long they came to the northern gap<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and rode swiftly through, and the land fell away before them. It was a merry<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">journey with Tom Bombadil trotting gaily beside them, or before them, on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fatty Lumpkin, who could move much faster than his girth promised. Tom<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">sang<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">most of the time, but it was chiefly nonsense, or else perhaps a strange<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">language unknown to the hobbits, an ancient language whose words were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">mainly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">those of wonder and delight.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They went forward steadily, but they soon saw that the Road was further<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">away than they had imagined. Even without a fog, their sleep at mid-day<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">would have prevented them from reaching it until after nightfall on the day<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">before. The dark line they had seen was not a line of trees but a line of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">bushes growing on the edge of a deep dike with a steep wall on the further<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">side. Tom said that it had once been the boundary of a kingdom, but a very<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">long lime ago. He seemed to remember something sad about it, and would not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">say much.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They climbed down and out of the dike and through a gap in the wall,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and then Tom turned due north, for they had been bearing somewhat to the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">west. The land was now open and fairly level, and they quickened their pace,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">but the sun was already sinking low when at last they saw a line of tall<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">trees ahead, and they knew that they had come back to the Road after many<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">unexpected adventures. They galloped their ponies over the last furlongs,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and halted under the long shadows of the trees. They were on the top of a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">sloping bank, and the Road, now dim as evening drew on, wound away<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">below<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">them. At this point it ran nearly from South-west to North-east, and on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">their right it fell quickly down into a wide hollow. It was rutted and bore<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">many signs of the recent heavy rain; there were pools and pot-holes full of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">water. They rode down the bank and looked up and down. There was nothing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">be seen. 'Well, here we are again at last!' said Frodo. 'I suppose we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">havenâ€™t lost more than two days by my short cut through the Forest! But<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">perhaps the delay will prove useful - it may have put them off our trail.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The others looked at him. The shadow of the fear of the Black Riders<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">came suddenly over them again. Ever since they had entered the Forest they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">had thought chiefly of getting back to the Road; only now when it lay<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">beneath their feet did they remember the danger which pursued them, and was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">more than likely to be lying in wait for them upon the Road itself. They<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">looked anxiously back towards the setting sun, but the Road was brown and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">empty.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Do you think,' asked Pippin hesitatingly, 'do you think we may be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">pursued, tonight?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'No, I hope not tonight,' answered Tom Bombadil; 'nor perhaps the next<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">day. But do not trust my guess; for I cannot tell for certain. Out east my<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">knowledge fails. Tom is not master of Riders from the Black Land far beyond<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">his country.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All the same the hobbits wished he was coming with them. They felt that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">he would know how to deal with Black Riders, if anyone did. They would<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">soon<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">now be going forward into lands wholly strange to them, and beyond all but<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the most vague and distant legends of the Shire, and in the gathering<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">twilight they longed for home. A deep loneliness and sense of loss was on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">them. They stood silent, reluctant to make the final parting, and only<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">slowly became aware that Tom was wishing them farewell, and telling them to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">have good heart and to ride on till dark without halting.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">â€™Tom will give you good advice, till this day is over (after that your<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">own luck must go with you and guide you): four miles along the Road you'll<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">come upon a village, Bree under Bree-hill, with doors looking westward.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There you'll find an old inn that is called The Prancing Pony. Barliman<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Butterbur is the worthy keeper. There you can stay the night, and afterwards<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the morning will speed you upon your way. Be bold, but wary! Keep up your<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">merry hearts, and ride to meet your fortune!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They begged him to come at least as far as the inn and drink once more<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">with them; but he laughed and refused, saying:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tom's country ends here: he will not pass the borders.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tom has his house to mind, and Goldberry is waiting!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Then he turned, tossed up his hat, leaped on Lumpkin's back, and rode<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">up over the bank and away singing into the dusk.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The hobbits climbed up and watched him until he was out of sight.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'I am sorry to take leave of Master Bombadil,' said Sam. 'He's a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">caution and no mistake. I reckon we may go a good deal further and see<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">naught better, nor queerer. But I won't deny I'll be glad to see this<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Prancing Pony he spoke of. I hope it'll be like The Green Dragon away back<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">home! What sort of folk are they in Bree?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'There are hobbits in Bree,' said Merry, 'as well as Big Folk. I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">daresay it will be homelike enough. The Pony is a good inn by all accounts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My people ride out there now and again.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'It may be all we could wish,' said Frodo; 'but it is outside the Shire<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">all the same. Don't make yourselves too much at home ! Please remember -all<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of you - that the name of Baggins must NOT be mentioned. I am Mr. Underhill,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">if any name must be given.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They now mounted their ponies and rode off silently into the evening.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Darkness came down quickly, as they plodded slowly downhill and up again,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">until at last they saw lights twinkling some distance ahead.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Before them rose Bree-hill barring the way, a dark mass against misty<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">stars; and under its western flank nestled a large village. Towards it they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">now hurried desiring only to find a fire, and a door between them and the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">night.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">like an island in the empty lands round about. Besides Bree itself, there<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">was Staddle on the other side of the hill, Combe in a deep valley a little<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">further eastward, and Archet on the edge of the Chetwood. Lying round<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Men of Bree were brown-haired, broad, and rather short, cheerful<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and independent: they belonged to nobody but themselves; but they were more<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of the first Men that ever wandered into the West of the middle-world. Few<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">had survived the turmoils of the Elder Days; but when the Kings returned<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">again over the Great Sea they had found the Bree-men still there, and they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">a hundred leagues of the Shire. But in the wild lands beyond Bree there were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">mysterious wanderers. The Bree-folk called them Rangers, and knew nothing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">their origin. They were taller and darker than the Men of Bree and were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">believed to have strange powers of sight and hearing, and to understand the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">languages of beasts and birds. They roamed at will southwards, and eastwards<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">even as far as the Misty Mountains; but they were now few and rarely seen.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When they appeared they brought news from afar, and told strange forgotten<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">tales which were eagerly listened to; but the Bree-folk did not make friends<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There were also many families of hobbits in the Bree-land and they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">founded long before even the Brandywine was crossed and the Shire colonized.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They lived mostly in Staddle though there were some in Bree itself,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">especially on the higher slopes of the hill, above the houses of the Men.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">rustic than most of their distant relatives Inside. It was not yet forgotten<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that there had been a time when there was much coming and going between<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Shire and Bree. There was Bree-blood in the Brandybucks by all accounts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The village of Bree had some hundred stone houses of the Big Folk,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">mostly above the Road, nestling on the hillside with windows looking west.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On that side, running in more than half a circle from the hill and back to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">it, there was a deep dike with a thick hedge on the inner side. Over this<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the Road crossed by a causeway; but where it pierced the hedge it was barred<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">by a great gate. There was another gate in the southern comer where the Road<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">ran out of the village. The gates were closed at nightfall; but just inside<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">them were small lodges for the gatekeepers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Down on the Road, where it swept to the right to go round the foot of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the hill, there was a large inn. It had been built long ago when the traffic<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">on the roads had been far greater. For Bree stood at an old meeting of ways;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">another ancient road crossed the East Road just outside (he dike at the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">western end of the village, and in former days Men and other folk of various<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">sorts had travelled much on it. Strange as News from Bree was still a saying<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">in the Eastfarthing, descending from those days, when news from North,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">South, and East could be heard in the inn, and when the Shire-hobbits used<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to go more often to hear it. But the Northern Lands had long been desolate,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and the North Road was now seldom used: it was grass-grown, and the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Bree-folk called it the Greenway.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Inn of Bree was still there, however, and the innkeeper was an<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">important person. His house was a meeting place for the idle, talkative, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">inquisitive among the inhabitants, large and small, of the four villages;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and a resort of Rangers and other wanderers, and for such travellers (mostly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">dwarves) as still journeyed on the East Road, to and from the Mountains.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It was dark, and white stars were shining, when Frodo and his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">companions came at last to the Greenway-crossing and drew near the village.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They came to the West-gate and found it shut, but at the door of the lodge<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">beyond it, there was a man sitting. He jumped up and fetched a lantern and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">looked over the gate at them in surprise.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">â€™What do you want, and where do you come from?' he asked gruffly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'We are making for the inn here,' answered Frodo. 'We are journeying<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">east and cannot go further tonight.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Hobbits ! Four hobbits ! And what's more, out of the Shire by their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">talk,' said the gatekeeper, softly as if speaking to himself. He stared at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">them darkly for a moment, and then slowly opened the gate and let them ride<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">through.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'We don't often see Shire-folk riding on the Road at night,' he went<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">on, as they halted a moment by his door. 'You'll pardon my wondering what<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">business takes you away east of Bree! What may your names be, might I ask?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Our names and our business are our own, and this does not seem a good<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">place to discuss them,' said Frodo, not liking the look of the man or the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">tone of his voice.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Your business is your own, no doubt,' said the man; 'but it's my<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">business to ask questions after nightfall.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'We are hobbits from Buckland, and we have a fancy to travel and to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">stay at the inn here,' put in Merry. 'I am Mr. Brandybuck. Is that enough<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">for you? The Bree-folk used to be fair-spoken to travellers, or so I had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">heard.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'All right, all right!' said the man. 'I meant no offence. But you'll<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">find maybe that more folk than old Harry at the gate will be asking you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">questions. There's queer folk about. If you go on to The Pony, you'll find<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">you're oat the only guests.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He wished them good night, and they said no more; but Frodo could see<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">in the lantern-light that the man was still eyeing them curiously. He was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">glad to hear the gate clang to behind them, as they rode forward. He<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">wondered why the man was so suspicious, and whether any one had been<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">asking<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">for news of a party of hobbits. Could it have been Gandalf? He might have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">arrived, while they were delayed in the Forest and the Downs. But there was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">something in the look and the voice of the gatekeeper that made him uneasy.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The man stared after the hobbits for a moment, and then he went back to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">his house. As soon as his back was turned, a dark figure climbed quickly in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">over the gate and melted into the shadows of the village street.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The hobbits rode on up a gentle slope, passing a few detached houses,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and drew up outside the inn. The houses looked large and strange to them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sam stared up at the inn with its three storeys and many windows, and felt<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">his heart sink. He had imagined himself meeting giants taller than trees,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and other creatures even more terrifying, some time or other in the course<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of his journey; but at the moment he was finding his first sight of Men and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">their tall houses quite enough, indeed too much for the dark end of a tiring<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">day. He pictured black horses standing all saddled in the shadows of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">inn-yard, and Black Riders peering out of dark upper windows.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'We surely aren't going to stay here for the night, are we, sir?' he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">exclaimed. 'If there are hobbit-folk in these pans, why don't we look for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">some that would be willing to take us in? It would be more homelike.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'What's wrong with the inn?' said Frodo. 'Tom Bombadil recommended it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I expect it's homelike enough inside.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Even from the outside the inn looked a pleasant house to familiar eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It had a front on the Road, and two wings running back on land partly cut<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">out of the lower slopes of the hill, so that at the rear the second-floor<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">windows were level with the ground. There was a wide arch leading to a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">courtyard between the two wings, and on the left under the arch there was a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">large doorway reached by a few broad steps. The door was open and light<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">streamed out of it. Above the arch there was a lamp, and beneath it swung a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">large signboard: a fat white pony reared up on its hind legs. Over the door<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">was painted in white letters: THE PRANCING PONY by BARLIMAN<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">BUTTERBUR. Many<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of the lower windows showed lights behind thick curtains.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As they hesitated outside in the gloom, someone began singing a merry<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">song inside, and many cheerful voices joined loudly in the chorus. They<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">listened to this encouraging sound for a moment and then got off their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">ponies. The song ended and there was a burst of laughter and clapping.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They led their ponies under the arch, and leaving them standing in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">yard they climbed up the steps. Frodo went forward and nearly bumped into a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">short fat man with a bald head and a red face. He had a white apron on, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">was bustling out of one door and in through another, carrying a tray laden<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">with full mugs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">â€™Can weâ€”' began Frodo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Half a minute, if you please!' shouted the man over his shoulder, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">vanished into a babel of voices and a cloud of smoke. In a moment he was out<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">again, wiping his hands on his apron.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Good evening, little master!' he said, bending down. 'What may you be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">wanting?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Beds for four, and stabling for five ponies, if that can be managed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Are you Mr. Butterbur?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'That's right! Barliman is my name. Barliman Butterbur at your service!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You're from the Shire, eh?' he said, and then suddenly he clapped his hand<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to his forehead, as if trying to remember something. 'Hobbits!' he cried.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Now what does that remind me of? Might I ask your names, sir?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Mr. Took and Mr. Brandybuck,' said Frodo; 'and this is Sam Gamgee. My<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">name is Underhill.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'There now!' said Mr. Butterbur, snapping his fingers. 'It's gone<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">again! But it'll come back, when I have time to think. I'm run off my feet;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">but I'll see what I can do for you. We don't often get a party out of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Shire nowadays, and I should be sorry not to make you welcome. But there is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">such a crowd already in the house tonight as there hasn't been for long<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">enough. It never rains but it pours, we say in Bree.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Hi! Nob!' he shouted. 'Where are you, you woolly -footed slow-coach?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Nob!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Coming, sir! Coming!' A cheery-looking hobbit bobbed out of a door,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and seeing the travellers, stopped short and stared at them with great<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">interest.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Where's Bob?' asked the landlord. 'You don't know? Well find him!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Double sharp! I haven't got six legs, nor six eyes neither! Tell Bob there's<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">five ponies that have to be stabled. He must find room somehow.' Nob trotted<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">off with a grin and a wink.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Well, now, what was I going to say?' said Mr. Butterbur, tapping his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">forehead. 'One thing drives out another, so to speak. I'm that busy tonight,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">my head is going round. There's a party that came up the Greenway from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">down<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">South last night - and that was strange enough to begin with. Then there's a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">travelling company of dwarves going West come in this evening. And now<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">there's you. If you weren't hobbits, I doubt if we could house you. But<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">we've got a room or two in the north wing that were made special for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">hobbits, when this place was built. On the ground floor as they usually<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">prefer; round windows and all as they like it. I hope you'll be comfortable.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You'll be wanting supper, I don't doubt. As soon as may be. This way now!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He led them a short way down a passage, and opened a door. 'Here is a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">nice little parlour!' he said. 'I hope it will suit. Excuse me now. I'm that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">busy. No time for talking. I must be trotting. It's hard work for two legs,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">but I don't get thinner. I'll look in again later. If you want anything,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">ring the hand-bell, and Nob will come. If he don't come, ring and shout!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Off he went at last, and left them feeling rather breathless. He seemed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">capable of an endless stream of talk, however busy he might be. They found<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">themselves in a small and cosy room. There was a bit of bright fire burning<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">on the hearth, and in front of it were some low and comfortable chairs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There was a round table, already spread with a white cloth, and on it was a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">large hand-bell. But Nob, the hobbit servant, came bustling in long before<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">they thought of ringing. He brought candles and a tray full of plates.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Will you be wanting anything to drink, masters?' he asked. 'And shall<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I show you the bedrooms, while your supper is got ready?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They were washed and in the middle of good deep mugs of beer when Mr.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Butterbur and Nob came in again. In a twinkling the table was laid. There<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">was hot soup, cold meats, a blackberry tart, new loaves, slabs of butter,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and half a ripe cheese: good plain food, as good as the Shire could show,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and homelike enough to dispel the last of Sam's misgivings (already much<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">relieved by the excellence of the beer).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The landlord hovered round for a link, and then prepared to leave them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'I don't know whether you would care to join the company, when you have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">supped,' he said, standing at the door. 'Perhaps you would rather go to your<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">beds. Still the company would be very pleased to welcome you, if you had a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">mind. We don't get Outsiders - travellers from the Shire, I should say,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">begging your pardon - often; and we like to hear a bit of news, or any story<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">or song you may have in mind. But as you please! Ring the bell, if you lack<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">anything!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So refreshed and encouraged did they feel at the end of their supper<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">(about three quarters of an hour's steady going, not hindered by unnecessary<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">talk) that Frodo, Pippin, and Sam decided to join the company. Merry said it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">would be too stuffy. 'I shall sit here quietly by the fire for a bit, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">perhaps go out later for a sniff of the air. Mind your Ps and Qs, and don't<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">forget that you are supposed to be escaping in secret, and are still on the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">high-road and not very far from the Shire!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'All right!' said Pippin. 'Mind yourself! Don't get lost, and don't<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">forget that it is safer indoors!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The company was in the big common-room of the inn. The gathering was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">large and mixed, as Frodo discovered, when his eyes got used to the light.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This came chiefly from a blazing log-fire, for the three lamps hanging from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the beams were dim, and half veiled in smoke. Barliman Butterbur was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">standing near the fire, talking to a couple of dwarves and one or two<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">strange-looking men. On the benches were various folk: men of Bree, a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">collection of local hobbits (sitting chattering together), a few more<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">dwarves, and other vague figures difficult to make out away in the shadows<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and comers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As soon as the Shire-hobbits entered, there was a chorus of welcome<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">from the Bree-landers. The strangers, especially those that had come up the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Greenway, stared at them curiously. The landlord introduced the newcomers to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the Bree-folk, so quickly that, though they caught many names, they were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">seldom sure who the names belonged to. The Men of Bree seemed all to have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">rather botanical (and to the Shire-folk rather odd) names, like Rushlight,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Goatleaf, Heathertoes, Appledore, Thistlewool and Ferny (not to mention<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Butterbur). Some of the hobbits had similar names. The Mug worts, for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">instance, seemed numerous. But most of them had natural names, such as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Banks, Brockhouse, Longholes, Sandheaver, and Tunnelly, many of which<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">used in the Shire. There were several Underhills from Saddle, and as they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">could not imagine sharing a name without being related, they took Frodo to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">their hearts as a long-lost cousin.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Bree-hobbits were, in fact, friendly and inquisitive, and Frodo<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">soon found that some explanation of what he was doing would have to be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">given. He gave out that he was interested in history and geography (at which<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">there was much wagging of heads, although neither of these words were much<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">used in the Bree-dialect). He said he was thinking of writing a book (at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">which there was silent astonishment), and that he and his friends wanted to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">collect information about hobbits living outside the Shire, especially in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the eastern lands.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At this a chorus of voices broke out. If Frodo had really wanted to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">write a book, and had had many ears, he would have learned enough for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">several chapters in a few minutes. And if that was not enough, he was given<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">a whole list of names, beginning with 'Old Barliman here', to whom he could<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">go for further information. But after a time, as Frodo did not show any sign<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of writing a book on the spot, the hobbits returned to their questions about<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">doings in the Shire. Frodo did not prove very communicative, and he soon<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">found himself sitting alone in a comer, listening and looking around.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Men and Dwarves were mostly talking of distant events and telling<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">flews of a kind that was becoming only too familiar. There was trouble away<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">in the South, and it seemed that the Men who had come up the Greenway<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">on the move, looking for lands where they could find some peace. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Bree-folk were sympathetic, but plainly not very ready to take a large<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">number of strangers into their little land. One of the travellers, a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">squint-eyed ill-favoured fellow, was foretelling that more and more people<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">would be coming north in the near future. 'If room isn't found for them,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">they'll find it for themselves. They've a right to live, same as other<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">folk,' he said loudly. The local inhabitants did not look pleased at the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">prospect.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The hobbits did not pay much attention to all this, and it did not at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the moment seem to concern hobbits. Big Folk could hardly beg for lodgings<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">in hobbit-holes. They were more interested in Sam and Pippin, who were now<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">feeling quite at home, and were chatting gaily about events in the Shire.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Pippin roused a good deal of laughter with an account of the collapse of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">roof of the Town Hole in Michel Delving: Will Whitfoot, the Mayor, and the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">fattest hobbit in the Westfarthing, had been buried in chalk, and came out<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">like a floured dumpling. But there were several questions asked that made<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Frodo a little uneasy. One of the Bree-landers, who seemed to have been in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the Shire several times, wanted to know where the Underhills lived and who<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">they were related to.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Suddenly Frodo noticed that a strange-looking weather-beaten man,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">sitting in the shadows near the wall, was also listening intently to the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">hobbit-talk. He had a tall tankard in front of him, and was smoking a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">long-stemmed pipe curiously carved. His legs were stretched out before him,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">showing high boots of supple leather that fitted him well, but had seen much<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">wear and were now caked with mud. A travel -stained cloak of heavy dark-<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">green<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">cloth was drawn close about him, and in spite of the heat of the room he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">wore a hood that overshadowed his face; but the gleam of his eyes could be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">seen as he watched the hobbits.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">â€™Who is that?' Frodo asked, when he got a chance to whisper to Mr.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Butterbur. 'I don't think you introduced him?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Him?' said the landlord in an answering whisper, cocking an eye<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">without turning his head. 'I don't rightly know. He is one of the wandering<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">folk -Rangers we call them. He seldom talks: not but what he can tell a rare<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">tale when he has the mind. He disappears for a month, or a year, and then he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">pops up again. He was in and out pretty often last spring; but I haven't<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">seen him about lately. What his right name is I've never heard: but he's<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">known round here as Strider. Goes about at a great pace on his long shanks;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">though he don't tell nobody what cause he has to hurry. But there's no<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">accounting for East and West, as we say in Bree, meaning the Rangers and the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Shire-folk, begging your pardon. Funny you should ask about him.' But at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that moment Mr. Butterbur was called away by a demand for more ale and his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">last remark remained unexplained.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Frodo found that Strider was now looking at him, as if he had heard or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">guessed all that had been said. Presently, with a wave of his hand and a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">nod, he invited Frodo to come over and sit by him. As Frodo drew near be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">threw back his hood, showing a shaggy head of dark hair necked with grey,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and in a pale stem face a pair of keen grey eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'I am called Strider,' he said in a low voice. 'I am very pleased to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">meet you. Master - Underhill, if old Butterbur got your name right.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'He did,' said Frodo stiffly. He felt far from comfortable under the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">stare of those keen eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Well, Master Underhill,' said Strider, 'if I were you, I should stop<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">your young friends from talking too much. Drink, fire, and chance -meeting<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">are pleasant enough, but, well - this isn't the Shire. There are queer folk<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">about. Though I say it as shouldn't, you may think,' he added with a wry<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">smile, seeing Frodo's glance. 'And there have been even stranger travellers<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">through Bree lately,' he went on, watching Frodo's face.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Frodo returned his gaze but said nothing; and Strider made no further<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">sign. His attention seemed suddenly to be fixed on Pippin. To his alarm<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Frodo became aware that the ridiculous young Took, encouraged by his success<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">with the fat Mayor of Michel Delving, was now actually giving a comic<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">account of Bilbo's farewell party. He was already giving an imitation of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Speech, and was drawing near to the astonishing Disappearance.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Frodo was annoyed. It was a harmless enough tale for most of the local<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">hobbits, no doubt: just a funny story about those funny people away beyond<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the River; but some (old Butterbur, for instance) knew a thing or two, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">had probably heard rumours long ago about Bilbo's vanishing. It would bring<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the name of Baggins to their minds, especially if there had been inquiries<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">in Bree after that name.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Frodo fidgeted, wondering what to do. Pippin was evidently much<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">enjoying the attention he was getting, and had become quite forgetful of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">their danger. Frodo had a sudden fear that in his present mood he might even<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">mention the Ring; and that might well be disastrous.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'You had better do something quick!' whispered Strider in his ear.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Frodo jumped up and stood on a table, and began to talk. The attention<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of Pippin's audience was disturbed. Some of the hobbits looked at Frodo and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">laughed and clapped, thinking that Mr. Underhill had taken as much ale as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">was good for him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Frodo suddenly felt very foolish, and found himself (as was his habit<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">when making a speech) fingering the things in his pocket. He felt the Ring<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">on its chain, and quite unaccountably the desire came over him to slip it on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and vanish out of the silly situation. It seemed to him, somehow, as if me<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">suggestion came to him from outside, from someone or something a the room.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He resisted the temptation firmly, and clasped the Ring in his hand, as if<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to keep a hold on it and prevent it from escaping or doing any mischief. At<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">any rate it gave him no inspiration. He spoke 'a few suitable words', as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">they would have said in the Shire: We are all very much gratified by the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">kindness of your reception, and I venture to hope that my brief visit will<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">help to renew the old ties of friendship between the Shire and Bree; and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">then he hesitated and coughed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Everyone in the room was now looking at him. 'A song!' shouted one of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the hobbits. 'A song! A song!' shouted all the others. 'Come on now, master,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">sing us something that we havenâ€™t heard before!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For a moment Frodo stood gaping. Then in desperation he began a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">ridiculous song that Bilbo had been rather fond of (and indeed rather proud<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of, for he had made up the words himself). It was about an inn; and that is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">probably why it came into Frodo's mind just then. Here it is in full. Only a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">few words of it are now, as a rule, remembered.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There is an inn, a merry old inn<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">beneath an old grey hill,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And there they brew a beer so brown<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That the Man in the Moon himself came down<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">one night to drink his fill.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The ostler has a tipsy cat<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that plays a five-stringed fiddle;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And up and down he runs his bow,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Now squeaking high, now purring low,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">now sawing in the middle.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The landlord keeps a little dog<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that is mighty fond of jokes;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When there's good cheer among the guests,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He cocks an ear at all the jests<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and laughs until he chokes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They also keep a horned cow<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">as proud as any queen;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But music turns her head like ale,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And makes her wave her tufted tail<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and dance upon the green.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And O! the rows of silver dishes<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and the store of silver spoons!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For Sunday* there's a special pair,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And these they polish up with care<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">on Saturday afternoons.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Man in the Moon was drinking deep,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and the cat began to wail;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A dish and a spoon on the table danced,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The cow in the garden madly pranced,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and the little dog chased his tail.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Man in the Moon took another mug,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and then rolled beneath his chair;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And there he dozed and dreamed of ale,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Till in the sky the stars were pale,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and dawn was in the air.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Then the ostler said to his tipsy cat:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'The white horses of the Moon,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They neigh and champ their silver bits;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But their master's been and drowned his wits,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and the Sun'll be rising soon!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So the cat on his fiddle played hey-diddle-diddle,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">a jig that would wake the dead:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He squeaked and sawed and quickened the tune,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While the landlord shook the Man in the Moon:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'It's after three!' he said.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They rolled the Man slowly up the hill<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and bundled him into the Moon,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While his horses galloped up in rear,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And the cow came capering like a deer,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and a dish ran up with the spoon.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Now quicker the fiddle went deedle-dum-diddle;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the dog began to roar,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The cow and the horses stood on their heads;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The guests all bounded from their beds<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and danced upon the floor.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With a ping and a pong the fiddle-strings broke!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the cow jumped over the Moon,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And the little dog laughed to see such fun,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And the Saturday dish went off at a run<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">with the silver Sunday spoon.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The round Moon rolled behind the hill<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">as the Sun raised up her head.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">She * hardly believed her fiery eyes;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For though it was day, to her surprise<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">they all went back to bed!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There was loud and long applause. Frodo had a good voice, and the song<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">tickled their fancy. 'Where's old Barley?' they cried. 'He ought to hear<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">this. Bob ought to learn his cat the fiddle, and then we'd have a dance.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They called for more ale, and began to shout: 'Let's have it again, master!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Come on now! Once more!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They made Frodo have another drink, and then begin his song again,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">while many of them joined in; for the tune was well known, and they were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">quick at picking up words. It was now Frodo's turn to feel pleased with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">himself. He capered about on the table; and when he came a second time to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the cow jumped over the Moon, he leaped in the air. Much too vigorously; for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">he came down, bang, into a tray full of mugs, and slipped, and rolled off<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the table with a crash, clatter, and bump! The audience all opened their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">mouths wide for laughter, and stopped short a gaping silence; for the singer<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">disappeared. He simply vanished, as if he had gone slap through the floor<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">without leaving a hole !<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The local hobbits stared in amazement, and then sprang to their feet<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and shouted for Barliman. All the company drew away from Pippin and Sam,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">who<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">found themselves left alone in a comer, and eyed darkly and doubtfully from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">a distance. It was plain that many people regarded them now as the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">companions of a travelling magician of unknown powers and purpose. But<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">there<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">was one swarthy Bree-lander, who stood looking at them with a knowing and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">half-mocking expression that made them feel very uncomfortable. Presently he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">slipped out of the door, followed by the squint-eyed southerner: the two had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">been whispering together a good deal during the evening. Harry the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">gatekeeper also went out just behind them..<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Frodo felt a fool. Not knowing what else to do, he crawled away under<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the tables to the dark comer by Strider, who sat unmoved, giving no sign of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">his thoughts. Frodo leaned back against the wall and took off the Ring. How<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">it came to be on his finger he could not tell. He could only suppose that he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">had been handling it in his pocket while he sang, and that somehow it had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">slipped on when he stuck out his hand with a jerk to save his fall. For a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">moment he wondered if the Ring itself had not played him a trick; perhaps it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">had tried to reveal itself in response to some wish or command that was felt<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">in the room. He did not like the looks of the men that had gone out.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Well?' said Strider, when he reappeared. â€™Why did you do that? Worse<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">than anything your friends could have said! You have put your foot in it! Or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">should I say your finger?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'I don't know what you mean,' said Frodo, annoyed and alarmed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Oh yes, you do,' answered Strider; 'but we had better wait until the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">uproar has died down. Then, if you please, Mr. Baggins, I should like a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">quiet word with you.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'What about?' asked Frodo, ignoring the sudden use of his proper name.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'A matter of some importance - to us both,' answered Strider, looking<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Frodo in the eye. 'You may hear something to your advantage.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Very well,' said Frodo, trying to appear unconcerned. 'I'll talk to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">you later.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Meanwhile an argument was going on by the fireplace. Mr. Butterbur had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">come trotting in, and he was now trying to listen to several conflicting<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">accounts of the event at the same time.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'I saw him, Mr. Butterbur,' said a hobbit; 'or leastways I didn't see<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">him, if you take my meaning. He just vanished into thin air, in a manner of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">speaking.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'You don't say, Mr. Mugwort!' said the landlord, looking puzzled.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Yes I do!' replied Mugwort. 'And I mean what I say, what's more.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'There's some mistake somewhere,' said Butterbur, shaking his head.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There was too much of that Mr. Underhill to go vanishing into thin air; or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">into thick air, as is more likely in this room.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Well, where is he now?' cried several voices.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'How should I know? He's welcome to go where he will, so long as he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">pays in the morning. There's Mr. Took, now: he's not vanished.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Well, I saw what I saw, and I saw what I didn't,' said Mugwort<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">obstinately.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'And I say there's some mistake,' repeated Butterbur, picking up the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">tray and gathering up the broken crockery.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Of course there's a mistake!' said Frodo. 'I haven't vanished. Here I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">am! I've just been having a few words with Strider in the comer.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He came forward into the firelight; but most of the company backed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">away,, even more perturbed than before. They were not in the least satisfied<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">by his explanation that he had crawled away quickly under the tables after<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">he had fallen. Most of the Hobbits and the Men of Bree went off then and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">there in a huff, having no fancy for further entertainment that evening. One<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">or two gave Frodo a black look and departed muttering among themselves.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dwarves and the two or three strange Men that still remained got up and said<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">good night to the landlord, but not to Frodo and his friends. Before long no<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">one was left but Strider, who sat on, unnoticed, by the wall.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Mr. Butterbur did not seem much put out. He reckoned, very probably,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that his house would be full again on many future nights, until the present<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">mystery had been thoroughly discussed. 'Now what have you been doing, Mr.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Underhill?' he asked. 'Frightening my customers and breaking up my crocks<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">with your acrobatics!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'I am very sorry to have caused any trouble,' said Frodo. 'It was quite<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">unintentional, I assure you. A most unfortunate accident.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'All right, Mr. Underhill! But if you're going to do any more tumbling,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">or conjuring, or whatever it was, you'd best warn folk beforehand - and warn<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">me. We're a bit suspicious round here of anything out of the way -uncanny,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">if you understand me; and we don't take to it all of a sudden.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'I shan't be doing anything of the sort again, Mr. Butterbur, I promise<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">you. And now I think I'll be getting to bed. We shall be making an early<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">start. Will you see that our ponies are ready by eight o'clock?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Very good! But before you go, I should like a word with you in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">private, Mr. Underhill. Something has just come back to my mind that I ought<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to tell you. I hope that you'll not take it amiss. When I've seen to a thing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">or two, I'll come along to your room, if you're willing.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Certainly!' said Frodo; but his heart sank. He wondered how many<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">private talks he would have before he got to bed, and what they would<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">reveal. Were these people all in league against him? He began to suspect<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">even old Butterbur's fat face of concealing dark designs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Chapter 10. Strider<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Frodo, Pippin, and Sam made their way back to the parlour. There was no<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">light. Merry was not there, and the fire had burned low. It was not until<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">they had puffed up the embers into a blaze and thrown on a couple of faggots<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that they discovered Strider had come with them. There he was calmly sitting<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">in a chair by the door!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Hallo!' said Pippin. 'Who are you, and what do you want?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'I am called Strider,' he answered: 'and though he may have forgotten<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">it, your friend promised to have a quiet talk with me.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'You said I might hear something to my advantage, I believe,' said<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Frodo. 'What have you to say?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Several things,' answered Strider. 'But, of course, I have my price.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'What do you mean?' asked Frodo sharply.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Don't be alarmed! I mean just this: I will tell you what I know, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">give you some good advice - but I shall want a reward.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'And what will that be, pray?' said Frodo. He suspected now that he had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">fallen in with a rascal, and he thought uncomfortably that he had brought<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">only a little money with him. All of it would hardly satisfy a rogue, and he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">could not spare any of it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'No more than you can afford,' answered Strider with a slow smile, as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">if he guessed Frodo's thoughts. 'Just this: you must take me along with you,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">until I wish to leave you.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Oh, indeed!' replied Frodo, surprised, but not much relieved. 'Even if<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I wanted another companion, I should not agree to any such thing, until I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">knew a good deal more about you, and your business.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Excellent!' exclaimed Strider, crossing his legs and sitting back<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">comfortably. 'You seem to be coming to your senses again, and that is all to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the good. You have been much too careless so far. Very well! I will tell you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">what I know, and leave the reward to you. You may be glad to grant it, when<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">you have heard me.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Go on then!' said Frodo. 'What do you know?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Too much; too many dark things,' said Strider grimly. 'But as for your<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">business â€” ' He got up and went to the door, opened it quickly and looked<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">out. Then he shut it quietly and sat down again. 'I have quick ears,' he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">went on, lowering his voice, 'and though I cannot disappear, I have hunted<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">many wild and wary things and I can usually avoid being seen, if I wish.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Now, I was behind the hedge this evening on the Road west of Bree, when four<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">hobbits came out of the Downlands. I need not repeat all that they said to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">old Bombadil or to one another, but one thing interested me. Please<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">remember, said one of them, that the name Baggins must not be mentioned. I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">am Mr. Underhill, if any name must be given. That interested me so much that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I followed them here. I slipped over the gate just behind them. Maybe Mr.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Baggins has an honest reason for leaving his name behind; but if so, I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">should advise him and his friends to be more careful.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'I don't see what interest my name has for any one in Bree,' said Frodo<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">angrily, 'and I have still to learn why it interests you. Mr. Strider may<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">have an honest reason for spying and eavesdropping; but if so, I should<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">advise him to explain it.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Well answered!' said Strider laughing. 'But the explanation is simple:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I was looking for a Hobbit called Frodo Baggins. I wanted to find him<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">quickly. I had learned that he was carrying out of the Shire, well, a secret<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that concerned me and my friends.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Now, don't mistake me!' he cried, as Frodo rose from his seat, and Sam<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">jumped up with a scowl. 'I shall take more care of the secret than you do.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And care is needed!' He leaned forward and looked at them. 'Watch every<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">shadow!' he said in a low voice. 'Black horsemen have passed through Bree.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On Monday one came down the Greenway, they say; and another appeared<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">later,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">coming up the Greenway from the south.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There was a silence. At last Frodo spoke to Pippin and Sam: 'I ought to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">have guessed it from the way the gatekeeper greeted us,' he said. 'And the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">landlord seems to have heard something. Why did he press us to join the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">company? And why on earth did we behave so foolishly: we ought to have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">stayed quiet in here.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'It would have been better,' said Strider. 'I would have stopped your<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">going into the common-room, if I could; but the innkeeper would not let me<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">in to see you, or take a message.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Do you think he ' began Frodo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'No, I don't think any harm of old Butterbur. Only he does not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">altogether like mysterious vagabonds of my sort.' Frodo gave him a puzzled<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">look. 'Well, I have rather a rascally look, have I not?' said Strider with a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">curl of his lip and a queer gleam in his eye. 'But I hope we shall get to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">know one another better. When we do, I hope you will explain what happened<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">at the end of your song. For that little prank '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'It was sheer accident!' interrupted Frodo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'I wonder,' said Strider. 'Accident, then. That accident has made your<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">position dangerous.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Hardly more than it was already,' said Frodo. 'I knew these horsemen<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">were pursuing me; but now at any rate they seem to have missed me and to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">have gone away.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'You must not count on that!' said Strider sharply. 'They will return.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And more are coming. There are others. I know their number. I know these<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Riders.' He paused, and his eyes were cold and hard. 'And there are some<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">folk in Bree who are not to be trusted,' he went on. 'Bill Ferny, for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">instance. He has an evil name in the Bree-land, and queer folk call at his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">house. You must have noticed him among the company: a swarthy sneering<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">fellow. He was very close with one of the Southern strangers, and they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">slipped out together just after your "accident". Not all of those<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Southerners mean well; and as for Ferny, he would sell anything to anybody;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">or make mischief for amusement.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'What will Ferny sell, and what has my accident got to do with him?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">said Frodo, still determined not to understand Strider's hints.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'News of you, of course,' answered Strider. 'An account of your<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">performance would be very interesting to certain people. After that they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">would hardly need to be told your real name. It seems to me only too likely<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that they will hear of it before this night is over. Is that enough? You can<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">do as you like about my reward: take me as a guide or not. But I may say<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that I know all the lands between the Shire and the Misty Mountains, for I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">have wandered over them for many years. I am older than I look. I might<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">prove useful. You will have to leave the open road after tonight; for the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">horsemen will watch it night and day. You may escape from Bree, and be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">allowed to go forward while the Sun is up; but you won't go far. They will<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">come on you in the wild, in some dark place where there is no help. Do you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">wish them to find you? They are terrible!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The hobbits looked at him, and saw with surprise that his face was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">drawn as if with pain, and his hands clenched the arms of his chair. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">room was very quiet and still, and the light seemed to have grown dim. For a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">while he sat with unseeing eyes as if walking in distant memory or listening<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to sounds in the Night far away.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'There!' he cried after a moment, drawing his hand across his brow.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Perhaps I know more about these pursuers than you do. You fear them, but<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">you do not fear them enough, yet. Tomorrow you will have to escape, if you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">can. Strider can take you by paths that are seldom trodden. Will you have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">him?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There was a heavy silence. Frodo made no answer, his mind was confused<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">with doubt and fear. Sam frowned, and looked at his master; and at last he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">broke out:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'With your leave, Mr. Frodo, I'd say no! This Strider here, he warns<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and he says take care; and I say yes to that, and let's begin with him. He<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">comes out of the Wild, and I never heard no good of such folk. He knows<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">something, that's plain, and more than I like; but it's no reason why we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">should let him go leading us out into some dark place far from help, as he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">puts it.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Pippin fidgeted and looked uncomfortable. Strider did not reply to Sam,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">but turned his keen eyes on Frodo. Frodo caught his glance and looked away.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'No,' he said slowly. 'I don't agree. I think, I think you are not really as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">you choose to look. You began to talk to me like the Bree-folk, but your<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">voice has changed. Still Sam seems right in this: I don't see why you should<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">warn us to take care, and yet ask us to take you on trust. Why the disguise?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Who are you? What do you really know about - about my business; and how<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">do<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">you know it?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'The lesson in caution has been well learned,' said Strider with a grim<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">smile. 'But caution is one thing and wavering is another. You will never get<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to Rivendell now on your own, and to trust me is your only chance. You must<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">make up your mind. I will answer some of your questions, if that will help<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">you to do so. But why should you believe my story, if you do not trust me<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">already? Still here it is '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At that moment there came a knock at the door. Mr. Butterbur had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">arrived with candles, and behind him was Nob with cans of hot water. Strider<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">withdrew into a dark corner.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'I've come to bid you good night,' said the landlord, putting the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">candles on the table. 'Nob! Take the water to the rooms!' He came in and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">shut the door.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'It's like this,' he began, hesitating and looking troubled. 'If I've<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">done any harm, I'm sorry indeed. But one thing drives out another, as you'll<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">admit; and I'm a busy man. But first one thing and then another this week<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">have jogged my memory, as the saying goes; and not too late I hope. You see,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I was asked to look out for hobbits of the Shire, and for one by the name of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Baggins in particular.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'And what has that got to do with me?' asked Frodo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Ah! you know best,' said the landlord, knowingly. 'I won't give you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">away; but I was told that this Baggins would be going by the name of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Underhill, and I was given a description that fits you well enough, if I may<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">say so.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Indeed! Let's have it then!' said Frodo, unwisely interrupting.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'A stout little fellow with red cheeks, ' said Mr. Butterbur solemnly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Pippin chuckled, but Sam looked indignant. 'That won't help you much; it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">goes for most hobbits. Barley, he says to me,' continued Mr. Butterbur with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">a glance at Pippin. 'But this one is taller than some and fairer than most,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and he has a cleft in his chin: perky chap with a bright eye. Begging your<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">pardon, but he said it, not me.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'He said it? And who was he?' asked Frodo eagerly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Ah! That was Gandalf, if you know who I mean. A wizard they say he is,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">but he's a good friend of mine, whether or no. But now I don't know what<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">he'll have to say to me, if I see him again: turn all my ale sour or me into<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">a block of wood, I shouldn't wonder. He's a bit hasty. Still what's done<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">can't be undone. '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Well, what have you done?' said Frodo, getting impatient with the slow<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">unravelling of Butterbur's thoughts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Where was I?' said the landlord, pausing and snapping his fingers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Ah, yes ! Old Gandalf. Three months back he walked right into my room<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">without a knock. Barley, he says, I'm off in the morning. Will you do<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">something for me? You've only to name it, I said. I'm in a hurry, said he,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and I've no time myself, but I want a message took to the Shire. Have you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">anyone you can send, and trust to go? I can find someone, I said, tomorrow,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">maybe, or the day after. Make it tomorrow, he says, and then he gave me a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">letter.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'It's addressed plain enough,' said Mr. Butterbur, producing a letter<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">from his pocket, and reading out the address slowly and proudly (he valued<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">his reputation as a lettered man):<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Mr FRODO BAGGINS, BAG END, HOBBITON in the SHIRE.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'A letter for me from Gandalf!' cried Frodo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Ah!' said Mr. Butterbur. 'Then your right name is Baggins?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'It is,' said Frodo, 'and you had better give me that letter at once,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and explain why you never sent it. That's what you came to tell me, I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">suppose, though you've taken a long time to come to the point.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Poor Mr. Butterbur looked troubled. 'You're right, master,' he said,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'and I beg your pardon. And I'm mortal afraid of what Gandalf will say, if<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">harm comes of it. But I didn't keep it back a-purpose. I put it by safe.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Then I couldn't find nobody willing to go to the Shire next day, nor the day<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">after, and none of my own folk were to spare; and then one thing after<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">another drove it out of my mind. I'm a busy man. I'll do what I can to set<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">matters right, and if there's any help I can give, you've only to name it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Leaving the letter aside, I promised Gandalf no less. Barley, he says<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to me, this friend of mine from the Shire, he may be coming out this way<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">before long, him and another. He'll be calling himself Underhill. Mind that!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But you need ask no questions. And if I'm not with him, he may be in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">trouble, and he may need help. Do whatever you can for him, and I'll be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">grateful, he says. And here you are, and trouble is not far off, seemingly.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'What do you mean?' asked Frodo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'These black men,' said the landlord lowering his voice. 'They're<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">looking for Baggins, and if they mean well, then I'm a hobbit. It was on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Monday, and all the dogs were yammering and the geese screaming. Uncanny,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">called it. Nob, he came and told me that two black men were at the door<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">asking for a hobbit called Baggins. Nob's hair was all stood on end. I bid<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the black fellows be off, and slammed the door on them; but they've been<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">asking the same question all the way to Archet, I hear. And that Ranger,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Strider, he's been asking questions, too. Tried to get in here to see you,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">before you'd had bite or sup, he did.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Fie did!' said Strider suddenly, coming forward into the light. 'And<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">much trouble would have been saved, if you had let him in, Barliman.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The landlord jumped with surprise. 'You!' he cried. 'You're always<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">popping up. What do you want now?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'He's here with my leave,' said Frodo. 'He came to offer me his help.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Well, you know your own business, maybe,' said Mr. Butterbur, looking<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">suspiciously at Strider. 'But if I was in your plight, I wouldn't take up<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">with a Ranger.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Then who would you take up with?' asked Strider. 'A fat innkeeper who<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">only remembers his own name because people shout it at him all day? They<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">cannot stay in The Pony for ever, and they cannot go home. They have a long<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">road before them. Will you go with them and keep the black men off?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Me? Leave Bree! I wouldn't do that for any money,' said Mr. Butterbur,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">looking really scared. 'But why can't you stay here quiet for a bit, Mr.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Underhill? What are all these queer goings on? What are these black men<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">after, and where do they come from, I'd like to know?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'I'm sorry I can't explain it all,' answered Frodo. 'I am tired and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">very worried, and it's a long tale. But if you mean to help me, I ought to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">warn you that you will be in danger as long as I am in your house. These<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Black Riders: I am not sure, but I think, I fear they come from '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'They come from Mordor,' said Strider in a low voice. 'From Mordor,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Barliman, if that means anything to you.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Save us!' cried Mr. Butterbur turning pale; the name evidently was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">known to him. 'That is the worst news that has come to Bree in my time.' 'It<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">is,' said Frodo. 'Are you still willing to help me?' 'I am,' said Mr.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Butterbur. 'More than ever. Though I don't know what the likes of me can do<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">against, against ' he faltered.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Against the Shadow in the East,' said Strider quietly. 'Not much,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Barliman, but every little helps. You can let Mr. Underhill stay here<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">tonight, as Mr. Underhill, and you can forget the name of Baggins, till he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">is far away.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'I'll do that,' said Butterbur. 'But they'll find out he's here without<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">help from me, I'm afraid. It's a pity Mr. Baggins drew attention to himself<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">this evening, to say no more. The story of that Mr. Bilbo's going off has<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">been heard before tonight in Bree. Even our Nob has been doing some guessing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">in his slow pate: and there are others in Bree quicker in the uptake than he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">is.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Well, we can only hope the Riders won't come back yet,' said Frodo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'I hope not, indeed,' said Butterbur. 'But spooks or no spooks, they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">won't get in The Pony so easy. Don't you worry till the morning. Nob'll say<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">no word. No black man shall pass my doors, while I can stand on my legs. Me<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and my folk'll keep watch tonight; but you had best get some sleep, if you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">can.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'In any case we must be called at dawn,' said Frodo. 'We must get off<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">as early as possible. Breakfast at six-thirty, please.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Right! I'll see to the orders,' said the landlord. 'Good night, Mr.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Baggins - Underhill, I should say! Good night - now, bless me! Where's your<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Mr. Brandybuck?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'I donâ€™t know,' said Frodo with sudden anxiety. They had forgotten all<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">about Merry, and it was getting late. 'I am afraid he is out. He said<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">something about going for a breath of air.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Well, you do want looking after and no mistake: your party might be on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">a holiday!' said Butterbur. 'I must go and bar the doors quick, but I'll see<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">your friend is let in when he comes. I'd better send Nob to look for him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Good night to you all!' At last Mr. Butterbur went out, with another<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">doubtful look at Strider and a shake of his head. His footsteps retreated<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">down the passage.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Well?' said Strider. 'When are you going to open that letter?' Frodo<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">looked carefully at the seal before he broke it. It seemed certainly to be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Gandalf s. Inside, written in the wizard's strong but graceful script, was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the following message:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dear Frodo,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Bad news has reached me here. I must go off at once. You had better<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">leave Bag End soon, and get out of the Shire before the end of July at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">latest. I will return as soon as I can; and I will follow you, if I find<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that you are gone. Leave a message for me here, if you pass through Bree.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You can trust the landlord (Butterbur). You may meet a friend of mine on the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">PPS. Make sure that it is the real Strider. There are many strange men<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">on the roads. His true name is Aragorn.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">PPPS. I hope Butterbur sends this promptly. A worthy man, but his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">memory is like a lumber-roam: thing wanted always buried. If he forgets, I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Frodo read the letter to himself, and then passed it to Pippin and Sam.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Really old Butterbur has made a mess of things!' he said. 'He deserves<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">roasting. If I had got this at once, we might all have been safe in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Rivendell by now. But what can have happened to Gandalf? He writes as if he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">was going into great danger.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'He has been doing that for many years,' said Strider.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Frodo turned and looked at him thoughtfully, wondering about Gandalf s<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">second postscript. 'Why didn't you tell me that you were Gandalf s friend at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">once?' he asked. 'It would have saved time.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Would it? Would any of you have believed me till now?' said Strider.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'I knew nothing of this letter. For all I knew I had to persuade you to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">trust me without proofs, if I was to help you. In any case, I did not intend<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to tell you all about myself at once. I had to study you first, and make<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">sure of you. The Enemy has set traps for me before now. As soon as I had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">made up my mind, I was ready to tell you whatever you asked. But I must<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">admit,' he added with a queer laugh, 'that I hoped you would take to me for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">my own sake. A hunted man sometimes wearies of distrust and longs for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">friendship. But there, I believe my looks are against me.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'They are - at first sight at any rate,' laughed Pippin with sudden<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">relief after reading Gandalf's letter. 'But handsome is as handsome does, as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">we say in the Shire; and I daresay we shall all look much the same after<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">lying for days in hedges and ditches.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'It would take more than a few days, or weeks, or years, of wandering<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">in the Wild to make you look like Strider,' he answered. 'And you would die<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">first, unless you are made of sterner stuff than you look to be.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Pippin subsided; but Sam was not daunted, and he still eyed Strider<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">dubiously. 'How do we know you are the Strider that Gandalf speaks about?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">he demanded. 'You never mentioned Gandalf, till this letter came out. You<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">might be a play-acting spy, for all I can see, trying to get us to go with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">you. You might have done in the real Strider and took his clothes. What have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">you to say to that?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'That you are a stout fellow,' answered Strider; 'but I am afraid my<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">only answer to you, Sam Gamgee, is this. If I had killed the real Strider, I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">could kill you. And I should have killed you already without so much talk.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If I was after the Ring, I could have it - NOW!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He stood up, and seemed suddenly to grow taller. In his eyes gleamed a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">light, keen and commanding. Throwing back his cloak, he laid his hand on the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">hilt of a sword that had hung concealed by his side. They did not dare to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">move. Sam sat wide-mouthed staring at him dumbly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'But I am the real Strider, fortunately,' he said, looking down at them<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">with his face softened by a sudden smile. 'I am Aragorn son of Arathorn; and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">if by life or death I can save you, I will.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There was a long silence. At last Frodo spoke with hesitation. 'I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">believed that you were a friend before the letter came,' he said, 'or at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">least I wished to. You have frightened me several times tonight, but never<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">in the way that servants of the Enemy would, or so I imagine. I think one of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">his spies would - well, seem fairer and feel fouler, if you understand.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'I see,' laughed Strider. 'I look foul and feel fair. Is that it? All<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that is gold does not glitter, not all those who wander are lost '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Did the verses apply to you then?' asked Frodo. 'I could not make out<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">what they were about. But how did you know that they were in Gandalf s<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">letter, if you have never seen it?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'I did not know,' he answered. 'But I am Aragorn, and those verses go<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">with that name.' He drew out his sword, and they saw that the blade was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">indeed broken a foot below the hilt. 'Not much use is it, Sam?' said<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Strider. 'But the time is near when it shall be forged anew.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sam said nothing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Well,' said Strider, 'with Sam's permission we will call that settled.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Strider shall be your guide. We shall have a rough road tomorrow. Even if we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">are allowed to leave Bree unhindered, we can hardly hope now to leave it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">unnoticed. But I shall try to get lost as soon as possible. I know one or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">two ways out of Bree-land other than the main road. If once we shake off the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">pursuit, I shall make for Weathertop.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Weathertop?' said Sam. 'What's that?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'It is a hill, just to the north of the Road, about half way from here<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to Rivendell. It commands a wide view all round; and there we shall have a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">chance to look about us. Gandalf will make for that point, if he follows us.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After Weathertop our journey will become more difficult, and we shall have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to choose between various dangers.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">â€™When did you last see Gandalf?' asked Frodo. 'Do you know where he is,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">or what he is doing?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Strider looked grave. 'I do not know,' he said. 'I came west with him<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">in the spring. I have often kept watch on the borders of the Shire in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">last few years, when he was busy elsewhere. He seldom left it unguarded. We<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">last met on the first of May: at Sam Ford down the Brandywine. He told me<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that his business with you had gone well, and that you would be starting for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Rivendell in the last week of September. As I knew he was at your side, I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">went away on a journey of my own. And that has proved ill; for plainly some<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">news reached him, and I was not at hand to help.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'I am troubled, for the first time since I have known him. We should<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">have had messages, even if he could not come himself. When I returned, many<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">days ago, I heard the ill news. The tidings had gone far and wide that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Gandalf was missing and the horsemen had been seen. It was the Elven-folk of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Gildor that told me this; and later they told me that you had left your<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">home; but there was no news of your leaving Buckland. I have been watching<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the East Road anxiously.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Do you think the Black Riders have anything to do with it - with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Gandalf's absence, I mean?' asked Frodo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'I do not know of anything else that could have hindered him, except<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the Enemy himself,' said Strider. 'But do not give up hope ! Gandalf is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">greater than you Shire-folk know - as a rule you can only see his jokes and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">toys. But this business of ours will be his greatest task.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Pippin yawned. 'I am sorry,' he said, 'but I am dead tired. In spite of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">all the danger and worry I must go to bed, or sleep where I sit. Where is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that silly fellow, Merry? It would be the last straw, if we had to go out in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the dark to look for him.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At that moment they heard a door slam; then feet came running along the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">passage. Merry came in with a rush followed by Nob. He shut the door<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">hastily, and leaned against it. He was out of breath. They stared at him in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">alarm for a moment before he gasped: 'I have seen them, Frodo! I have seen<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">them! Black Riders!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Black Riders!' cried Frodo. 'Where?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Here. In the village. I stayed indoors for an hour. Then as you did<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">not come back, I went out for a stroll. I had come back again and was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">standing just outside the light of the lamp looking at the stars. Suddenly I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">shivered and felt that something horrible was creeping near: there was a son<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of deeper shade among the shadows across the road, just beyond the edge of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the lamplight. It slid away at once into the dark without a sound. There was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">no horse.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Which way did it go?' asked Strider, suddenly and sharply. Merry<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">started, noticing the stranger for the first time. 'Go on!' said Frodo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'This is a friend of Gandalf's. I will explain later.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'It seemed to make off up the Road, eastward,' continued Merry. 'I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">tried to follow. Of course, it vanished almost at once; but I went round the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">corner and on as far as the last house on the Road.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Strider looked at Merry with wonder. 'You have a stout heart,' he said;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'but it was foolish.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'I don't know,' said Merry. 'Neither brave nor silly, I think. I could<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">hardly help myself. I seemed to be drawn somehow. Anyway, I went, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">suddenly I heard voices by the hedge. One was muttering; and the other was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">whispering, or hissing. I couldn't hear a word that was said. I did not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">creep any closer, because I began to tremble all over. Then I felt<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">terrified, and I turned back, and was just going to bolt home, when<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">something came behind me and I... I fell over.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'I found him, sir,' put in Nob. 'Mr. Butterbur sent me out with a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">lantern. I went down to West-gate, and then back up towards South-gate. Just<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">nigh Bill Ferny's house I thought I could see something in the Road. I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">couldn't swear to it, but it looked to me as if two men was stooping over<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">something, lilting it. I gave a shout, but where I got up to the spot there<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">was no signs of them, and only Mr. Brandybuck lying by the roadside. He<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">seemed to be asleep. "I thought I had fallen into deep water," he says to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">me, when I shook him. Very queer he was, and as soon as I had roused him, he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">got up and ran back here like a hare.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'I am afraid that's true,' said Merry, 'though I don't know what I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">said. I had an ugly dream, which I can't remember. I went to pieces. I don't<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">know what came over me.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'I do,' said Strider. 'The Black Breath. The Riders must have left<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">their horses outside, and passed back through the South-gate in secret. They<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">will know all the news now, for they have visited Bill Ferny; and probably<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that Southerner was a spy as well. Something may happen in the night, before<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">we leave Bree.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'What will happen?' said Merry. 'Will they attack the inn?' 'No, I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">think not,' said Strider. 'They are not all here yet. And in any case that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">is not their way. In dark and loneliness they are strongest; they will not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">openly attack a house where there are lights and many people -not until they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">are desperate, not while all the long leagues of Eriador still lie before<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">us. But their power is in terror, and already some in Bree are in their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">clutch. They will drive these wretches to some evil work: Ferny, and some of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the strangers, and, maybe, the gatekeeper too. They had words with Harry at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">West-gate on Monday. I was watching them. He was white and shaking when<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">left him.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'We seem to have enemies all round,' said Frodo. 'What are we to do?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Stay here, and do not go to your rooms ! They are sure to have found<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">out which those are. The hobbit-rooms have windows looking north and close<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to the ground. We will all remain together and bar this window and the door.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But first Nob and I will fetch your luggage.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While Strider was gone, Frodo gave Merry a rapid account of all that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">had happened since supper. Merry was still reading and pondering Gandalf's<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">letter when Strider and Nob returned.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Well Masters,' said Nob, 'I've ruffled up the clothes and put in a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">bolster down the middle of each bed. And I made a nice imitation of your<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">head with a brown woollen mat, Mr. Bag - Underhill, sir,' he added with a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">grin.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Pippin laughed. 'Very life-like!' he said. 'But what will happen when<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">they have penetrated the disguise?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'We shall see,' said Strider. 'Fet us hope to hold the fort till<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">morning.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Good night to you,' said Nob, and went off to take his part in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">watch on the doors.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Their bags and gear they piled on the parlour-floor. They pushed a low<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">chair against the door and shut the window. Peering out, Frodo saw that the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">night was still clear. The Sickle was swinging bright above the shoulders of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Bree-hill. He then closed and barred the heavy inside shutters and drew the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">curtains together. Strider built up the fire and blew out all the candles.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The hobbits lay down on their blankets with their feet towards the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">hearth; but Strider settled himself in the chair against the door. They<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">talked for a little, for Merry still had several questions to ask.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Jumped over the Moon!' chuckled Merry as he rolled himself in his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">blanket. 'Very ridiculous of you, Frodo! But I wish I had been there to see.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The worthies of Bree will be discussing it a hundred years hence.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'I hope so,' said Strider. Then they all fell silent, and one by one<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the hobbits dropped off to sleep.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As they prepared for sleep in the inn at Bree, darkness lay on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Buckland; a mist strayed in the dells and along the river -bank. The house at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Crickhollow stood silent. Fatty Bolger opened the door cautiously and peered<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">out. A feeling of fear had been growing on him all day, and he was unable to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">rest or go to bed: there was a brooding threat in the breathless night-air.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As he stared out into the gloom, a black shadow moved under the trees; the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">gate seemed to open of its own accord and close again without a sound.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Terror seized him. He shrank back, and for a moment he stood trembling in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the hall. Then he shut and locked the door.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The night deepened. There came the soft sound of horses led with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">stealth along the lane. Outside the gate they stopped, and three black<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">figures entered, like shades of night creeping across the ground. One went<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to the door, one to the corner of the house on either side; and there they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">stood, as still as the shadows of stones, while night went slowly on. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">house and the quiet trees seemed to be waiting breathlessly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There was a faint stir in the leaves, and a cock crowed far away. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">cold hour before dawn was passing. The figure by the door moved. In the dark<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">without moon or stars a drawn blade gleamed, as if a chill light had been<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">unsheathed. There was a blow, soft but heavy, and the door shuddered.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">'Open, in the name of Mordor!' said a voice thin and menacing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At a second blow the door yielded and fell back, with timbers burst and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">lock broken. The black figures passed swiftly in.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At that moment, among the trees nearby, a horn rang out. It rent the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">night like fire on a hill -top.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">AWAKE! FEAR! FIRE! FOES! AWAKE!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fatty Bolger had not been idle. As soon as he saw the dark shapes creep<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">from the garden, he knew that he must run for it, or perish. And run he did,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">out of the back door, through the garden, and over the fields. When he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">reached the nearest house, more than a mile away, he collapsed on the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">doorstep. 'No, no, no!' he was crying. 'No, not me! I haven't got it!' It<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">was some time before anyone could make out what he was babbling about.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">last they got the idea that enemies were in Buckland, some strange invasion<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">from the Old Forest. And then they lost no more time.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">FEAR! FIRE! FOES!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Brandybucks were blowing the Horn-call of Buckland, that had not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">been sounded for a hundred years, not since the white wolves came in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fell Winter, when the Brandywine was frozen over.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">AWAKE! AWAKE!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Far-away answering horns were heard. The alarm was spreading. The black<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">figures fled from the house. One of them let fall a hobbit-cloak on the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">step, as he ran. In the lane the noise of hoofs broke out, and gathering to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">a gallop, went hammering away into the darkness. All about Crickhollow there<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">was the sound of horns blowing, and voices crying and feet running. But the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Black Riders rode like a gale to the North-gate. Let the little people blow!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sauron would deal with them later. Meanwhile they had another errand: they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">knew now that the house was empty and the Ring had gone. They rode down<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">guards at the gate and vanished from the Shire.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the early night Frodo woke from deep sleep, suddenly, as if some<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">sound or presence had disturbed him. He saw that Strider was sitting alert<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">in his chair: his eyes gleamed in the light of the fire, which had been<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">tended and was burning brightly; but he made no sign or movement.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Frodo soon went to sleep again; but his dreams were again troubled with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the noise of wind and of galloping hoofs. The wind seemed to be curling<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">round the house and shaking it; and far off he heard a horn blowing wildly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He opened his eyes, and heard a cock crowing lustily in the inn-yard.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Strider had drawn the curtains and pushed back the shutters with a clang.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The first grey light of day was in the room, and a cold air was coming<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">through the open window.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As soon as Strider had roused them all, he led the way to their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">bedrooms. When they saw them they were glad that they had taken his advice:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the windows had been forced open and were swinging, and the curtains were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">flapping; the beds were tossed about, and the bolsters slashed and flung<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">upon the floor; the brown mat was torn to pieces.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Strider immediately went to fetch the landlord. Poor Mr. Butterbur<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">looked sleepy and frightened. He had hardly closed his eyes all night (so he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">said), but he had never heard a sound.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
