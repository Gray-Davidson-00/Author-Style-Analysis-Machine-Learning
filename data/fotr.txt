<p class="p4"><span class="s3">War of the Ring and included many glimpses of the yet more ancient history<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that preceded it. It was begun soon after The Hobbit was written and before<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">its publication in 1937; but I did not go on with this sequel, for I wished<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">first to complete and set in order the mythology and legends of the Elder<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Days, which had then been taking shape for some years. I desired to do this<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">for my own satisfaction, and I had little hope that other people would be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">interested in this work, especially since it was primarily linguistic in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">inspiration and was begun in order to provide the necessary background of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'history' for Elvish tongues.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">When those whose advice and opinion I sought corrected little hope to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">no hope, I went back to the sequel, encouraged by requests from readers for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">more information concerning hobbits and their adventures. But the story was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">drawn irresistibly towards the older world, and became an account, as it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were, of its end and passing away before its beginning and middle had been<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">told. The process had begun in the writing of The Hobbit, in which there<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were already some references to the older matter: Elrond, Gondolin, the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">High-elves, and the ores, as well as glimpses that had arisen unbidden of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">things higher or deeper or darker than its surface: Durin, Moria, Gandalf,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Necromancer, the Ring. The discovery of the significance of these<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">glimpses and of their relation to the ancient histories revealed the Third<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Age and its culmination in the War of the Ring.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Those who had asked for more information about hobbits eventually got<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it, but they had to wait a long time; for the composition of The Lord of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Rings went on at intervals during the years 1936 to 1949, a period in which<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I had many duties that I did not neglect, and many other interests as a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">learner and teacher that often absorbed me. The delay was, of course, also<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">increased by the outbreak of war in 1939, by the end of which year the tale<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">had not yet reached the end of Book One. In spite of the darkness of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">next five years I found that the story could not now be wholly abandoned,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and I plodded on, mostly by night, till I stood by Balin's tomb in Moria.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There I halted for a long while. It was almost a year later when I went on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and so came to Lothlurien and the Great River late in 1941. In the next year<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I wrote the first drafts of the matter that now stands as Book Three, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the beginnings of chapters I and III of Book Five; and there as the beacons<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">flared in Anurien and Thjoden came to Harrowdale I stopped. Foresight had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">failed and there was no time for thought.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It was during 1944 that, leaving the loose ends and perplexities of a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">war which it was my task to conduct, or at least to report, 1 forced myself<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to tackle the journey of Frodo to Mordor. These chapters, eventually to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">become Book Four, were written and sent out as a serial to my son,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Christopher, then in South Africa with the RAF. Nonetheless it took another<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">five years before the tale was brought to its present end; in that time I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">changed my house, my chair, and my college, and the days though less dark<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were no less laborious. Then when the â€™endâ€™ had at last been reached the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">whole story had to be revised, and indeed largely re-written backwards. And<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it had to be typed, and re-typed: by me; the cost of professional typing by<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the ten-fingered was beyond my means.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Lord of the Rings has been read by many people since it finally<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">appeared in print; and I should like to say something here with reference to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the many opinions or guesses that I have received or have read concerning<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the motives and meaning of the tale. The prime motive was the desire of a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">tale-teller to try his hand at a really long story that would hold the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">attention of readers, amuse them, delight them, and at times maybe excite<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">them or deeply move them. As a guide I had only my own feelings for what is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">appealing or moving, and for many the guide was inevitably often at fault.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Some who have read the book, or at any rate have reviewed it, have found it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">boring, absurd, or contemptible; and I have no cause to complain, since I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">have similar opinions of their works, or of the kinds of writing that they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">evidently prefer. But even from the points of view of many who have enjoyed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">my story there is much that fails to please. It is perhaps not possible in a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">long tale to please everybody at all points, nor to displease everybody at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the same points; for I find from the letters that I have received that the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">passages or chapters that are to some a blemish are all by others specially<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">approved. The most critical reader of all, myself, now finds many defects,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">minor and major, but being fortunately under no obligation either to review<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the book or to write it again, he will pass over these in silence, except<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">one that has been noted by others: the book is too short.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As for any inner meaning or 'message', it has in the intention of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">author none. It is neither allegorical nor topical. As the story grew it put<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">down roots (into the past) and threw out unexpected branches: but its main<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">theme was settled from the outset by the inevitable choice of the Ring as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the link between it and The Hobbit. The crucial chapter, "The Shadow of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Past', is one of the oldest parts of the tale. It was written long before<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the foreshadow of 1939 had yet become a threat of inevitable disaster, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">from that point the story would have developed along essentially the same<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">lines, if that disaster had been averted. Its sources are things long before<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in mind, or in some cases already written, and little or nothing in it was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">modified by the war that began in 1939 or its sequels.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The real war does not resemble the legendary war in its process or its<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">conclusion. If it had inspired or directed the development of the legend,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">then certainly the Ring would have been seized and used against Sauron; he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">would not have been annihilated but enslaved, and Barad-dyr would not have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">been destroyed but occupied. Saruman, failing to get possession of the Ring,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">would m the confusion and treacheries of the time have found in Mordor the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">missing links in his own researches into Ring-lore, and before long he would<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">have made a Great Ring of his own with which to challenge the self-styled<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Ruler of Middle-earth. In that conflict both sides would have held hobbits<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in hatred and contempt: they would not long have survived even as slaves.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Other arrangements could be devised according to the tastes or views of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">those who like allegory or topical reference. But I cordially dislike<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">allegory in all its manifestations, and always have done so since I grew old<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and wary enough to detect its presence. I much prefer history, true or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">feigned, with its varied applicability to the thought and experience of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">readers. I think that many confuse 'applicability' with 'allegory'; but the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">one resides in the freedom of the reader, and the other in the purposed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">domination of the author.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">An author cannot of course remain wholly unaffected by his experience,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">but the ways in which a story-germ uses the soil of experience are extremely<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">complex, and attempts to define the process are at best guesses from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">evidence that is inadequate and ambiguous. It is also false, though<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">naturally attractive, when the lives of an author and critic have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">overlapped, to suppose that the movements of thought or the events of times<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">common to both were necessarily the most powerful influences. One has<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">indeed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">personally to come under the shadow of war to feel fully its oppression; but<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">as the years go by it seems now often forgotten that to be caught in youth<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">by 1914 was no less hideous an experience than to be involved in 1939 and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the following years. By 1918 all but one of my close friends were dead. Or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to take a less grievous matter: it has been supposed by some that The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was finishing my tale. It does not. It is an essential part of the plot,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">foreseen from the outset, though in the event modified by the character of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Saruman as developed in the story without, need I say, any allegorical<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">significance or contemporary political reference whatsoever. It has indeed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">some basis in experience, though slender (for the economic situation was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">entirely different), and much further back. The country in which I lived in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">by Bilbo himself, the first Hobbit to become famous in the world at large,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">few notes on the more important points are here collected from Hobbit-lore,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and the first adventure is briefly recalled.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Hobbits are an unobtrusive but very ancient people, more numerous<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">formerly than they are today; for they love peace and quiet and good tilled<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">earth: a well-ordered and well-farmed countryside was their favourite haunt.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They do not and did not understand or like machines more complicated than a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">forge -bellows, a water-mill, or a hand-loom, though they were skilful with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">tools. Even in ancient days they were, as a rule, shy of 'the Big Folk', as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they call us, and now they avoid us with dismay and are becoming hard to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">find. They are quick of hearing and sharp-eyed, and though they are inclined<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to be fat and do not hurry unnecessarily, they are nonetheless nimble and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">deft in their movements. They possessed from the first the art of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">disappearing swiftly and silently, when large folk whom they do not wish to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">meet come blundering by; and this an they have developed until to Men it may<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">seem magical. But Hobbits have never, in fact, studied magic of any kind,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and their elusiveness is due solely to a professional skill that heredity<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and practice, and a close friendship with the earth, have rendered<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">inimitable by bigger and clumsier races.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For they are a little people, smaller than Dwarves: less tout and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stocky, that is, even when they are not actually much shorter. Their height<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">is variable, ranging between two and four feet of our measure. They seldom<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">now reach three feet; but they hive dwindled, they say, and in ancient days<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they were taller. According to the Red Book, Bandobras Took (Bullroarer),<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">son of Isengrim the Second, was four foot five and able to ride a horse. He<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was surpassed in all Hobbit records only by two famous characters of old;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">but that curious matter is dealt with in this book.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As for the Hobbits of the Shire, with whom these tales are concerned,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in the days of their peace and prosperity they were a merry folk. They<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dressed in bright colours, being notably fond of yellow and green; but they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">seldom wore shoes, since their feet had tough leathery soles and were clad<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in a thick curling hair, much like the hair of their heads, which was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">commonly brown. Thus, the only craft little practised among them was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shoe-making; but they had long and skilful fingers and could make many other<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">useful and comely things. Their faces were as a rule good-natured rather<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">than beautiful, broad, bright-eyed, red-cheeked, with mouths apt to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">laughter, and to eating and drinking. And laugh they did, and eat, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">drink, often and heartily, being fond of simple jests at all times, and of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">six meals a day (when they could get them). They were hospitable and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">delighted in parties, and in presents, which they gave away freely and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">eagerly accepted.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It is plain indeed that in spite of later estrangement Hobbits are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">relatives of ours: far nearer to us than Elves, or even than Dwarves. Of old<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they spoke the languages of Men, after their own fashion, and liked and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">disliked much the same things as Men did. But what exactly our relationship<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">is can no longer be discovered. The beginning of Hobbits lies far back in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Elder Days that are now lost and forgotten. Only the Elves still<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">preserve any records of that vanished time, and their traditions are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">concerned almost entirely with their own history, in which Men appear seldom<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and Hobbits are not mentioned at all. Yet it is clear that Hobbits had, in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fact, lived quietly in Middle-earth for many long years before other folk<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">became even aware of them. And the world being after all full of strange<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">creatures beyond count, these little people seemed of very little<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">importance. But in the days of Bilbo, and of Frodo his heir, they suddenly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">became, by no wish of their own, both important and renowned, and troubled<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the counsels of the Wise and the Great.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Those days, the Third Age of Middle -earth, are now long past, and the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shape of all lands has been changed; but the regions in which Hobbits then<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">lived were doubtless the same as those in which they still linger: the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">North-West of the Old World, east of the Sea. Of their original home the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Hobbits in Bilbo's time preserved no knowledge. A love of learning (other<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">than genealogical lore) was far from general among them, but there remained<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">still a few in the older families who studied their own books, and even<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">gathered reports of old times and distant lands from Elves, Dwarves, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Men. Their own records began only after the settlement of the Shire, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">their most ancient legends hardly looked further back than their Wandering<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Days. It is clear, nonetheless, from these legends, and from the evidence of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">their peculiar words and customs, that like many other folk Hobbits had in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the distant past moved westward. Their earliest tales seem to glimpse a time<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">when they dwelt in the upper vales of Anduin, between the eaves of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Greenwood<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Great and the Misty Mountains. Why they later undertook the hard and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">perilous crossing of the mountains into Eriador is no longer certain. Their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">own accounts speak of the multiplying of Men in the land, and of a shadow<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that fell on the forest, so that it became darkened and its new name was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mirkwood.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Before the crossing of the mountains the Hobbits had already become<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">divided into three somewhat different breeds: Harfoots, Stoors, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Fallohides. The Harfoots were browner of skin, smaller, and shorter, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they were beardless and bootless; their hands and feet were neat and nimble;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and they preferred highlands and hillsides. The Stoors were broader, heavier<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in build; their feet and hands were larger, and they preferred flat lands<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and riversides. The Fallohides were fairer of skin and also of hair, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they were taller and slimmer than the others; they were lovers of trees and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of woodlands.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Harfoots had much to do with Dwarves in ancient times, and long<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">lived in the foothills of the mountains. They moved westward early, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">roamed over Eriador as far as Weathertop while the others were still in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Wilderland. They were the most normal and representative variety of Hobbit,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and far the most numerous. They were the most inclined to settle in one<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">place, and longest preserved their ancestral habit of living in tunnels and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">holes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Stoors lingered long by the banks of the Great River Anduin, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were less shy of Men. They came west after the Harfoots and followed the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">course of the Loudwater southwards; and there many of them long dwelt<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">between Tharbad and the borders of Dunland before they moved north again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Fallohides, the least numerous, were a northerly branch. They were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">more friendly with Elves than the other Hobbits were, and had more skill in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">language and song than in handicrafts; and of old they preferred hunting to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">tilling. They crossed the mountains north of Rivendell and came down the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">River Hoarwell. In Eriador they soon mingled with the other kinds that had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">preceded them, but being somewhat bolder and more adventurous, they were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">often found as leaders or chieftains among clans of Harfoots or Stoors. Even<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in Bilbo's time the strong Fallohidish strain could still be noted among the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">greater families, such as the Tooks and the Masters of Buckland.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the westlands of Eriador, between the Misty Mountains and the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mountains of Lune, the Hobbits found both Men and Elves. Indeed, a remnant<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">still dwelt there of the DÂ®nedain, the kings of Men that came over the Sea<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">out of Westernesse; but they were dwindling fast and the lands of their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">North Kingdom were falling far and wide into waste. There was room and to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">spare for incomers, and ere long the Hobbits began to settle in ordered<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">communities. Most of their earlier settlements had long disappeared and been<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">forgotten in Bilbo's time; but one of the first to become important still<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">endured, though reduced in size; this was at Bree and in the Chetwood that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">lay round about, some forty miles east of the Shire.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It was in these early days, doubtless, that the Hobbits learned their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">letters and began to write after the manner of the DÂ®nedain, who had in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">their turn long before learned the art from the Elves. And in those days<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">also they forgot whatever languages they had used before, and spoke ever<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">after the Common Speech, the Westron as it was named, that was current<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">through all the lands of the kings from Arnor to Gondor, and about all the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">coasts of the Sea from B elf alas to Lune. Yet they kept a few words of their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">own, as well as their own names of months and days, and a great store of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">personal names out of the past.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">About this time legend among the Hobbits first becomes history with a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">reckoning of years. For it was in the one thousand six hundred and first<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">year of the Third Age that the Fallohide brothers, Marcho and Blanco, set<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">out from Bree; and having obtained permission from the high king at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Fornostl, they crossed the brown river Baranduin with a great following of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Hobbits. They passed over the Bridge of Stonebows, that had been built in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the days of the power of the North Kingdom, and they took ail the land<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">beyond to dwell in, between the river and the Far Downs. All that was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">demanded of them was that they should keep the Great Bridge in repair, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">all other bridges and roads, speed the king's messengers, and acknowledge<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his lordship.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Thus began the Shire-reckoning, for the year of the crossing of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Brandywine (as the Hobbits turned the name) became Year One of the Shire,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and all later dates were reckoned from it. 2 At once the western Hobbits fell<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in love with their new land, and they remained there, and soon passed once<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">more out of the history of Men and of Elves. While there was still a king<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they were in name his subjects, but they were, in fact, ruled by their own<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">chieftains and meddled not at all with events in the world outside. To the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">last battle at Fornost with the Witch-lord of Angmar they sent some bowmen<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to the aid of the king, or so they maintained, though no tales of Men record<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it. But in that war the North Kingdom ended; and then the Hobbits took the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">land for their own, and they chose from their own chiefs a Thain to hold the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">authority of the king that was gone. There for a thousand years they were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">little troubled by wars, and they prospered and multiplied after the Dark<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Plague (S.R. 37) until the disaster of the Long Winter and the famine that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">followed it. Many thousands then perished, but the Days of Dearth (1158-60)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were at the time of this tale long past and the Hobbits had again become<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">accustomed to plenty. The land was rich and kindly, and though it had long<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">been deserted when they entered it, it had before been well tilled, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">there the king had once had many farms, cornlands, vineyards, and woods.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and fifty from the northern moors to the marshes in the south. The Hobbits<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">named it the Shire, as the region of the authority of their Thain, and a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">district of well-ordered business; and there in that pleasant comer of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">world they plied their well-ordered business of living, and they heeded less<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and less the world outside where dark things moved, until they came to think<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that peace and plenty were the rule in Middle-earth and the right of all<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sensible folk. They forgot or ignored what little they had ever known of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Guardians, and of the labours of those that made possible the long peace of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Shire. They were, in fact, sheltered, but they had ceased to remember<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At no time had Hobbits of any kind been warlike, and they had never<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fought among themselves. In olden days they had, of course, been often<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">obliged to fight to maintain themselves in a hard world; but in Bilbo's time<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that was very ancient history. The last battle, before this story opens, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">indeed the only one that had ever been fought within the borders of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Shire, was beyond living memory: the Battle of Greenfields, S.R. 1147, in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">which Bandobras Took routed an invasion of Ores. Even the weathers had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">grown<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">milder, and the wolves that had once come ravening out of the North in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">bitter white winters were now only a grandfather's tale. So, though there<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was still some store of weapons in the Shire, these were used mostly as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">trophies, hanging above hearths or on walls, or gathered into the museum at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Michel Delving. The Mathom-house it was called; for anything that Hobbits<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">had no immediate use for, but were unwilling to throw away, they called a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mathom. Their dwellings were apt to become rather crowded with mathoms,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">many of the presents that passed from hand to hand were of that son.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Nonetheless, ease and peace had left this people still curiously tough.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They were, if it came to it, difficult to daunt or to kill; and they were,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">perhaps, so unwearyingly fond of good things not least because they could,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">when put to it, do without them, and could survive rough handling by grief,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">foe, or weather in a way that astonished those who did not know them well<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and looked no further than their bellies and their well-fed faces. Though<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">slow to quarrel, and for sport killing nothing that lived, they were doughty<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">at bay, and at need could still handle arms. They shot well with the bow,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">for they were keen-eyed and sure at the mark. Not only with bows and arrows.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">If any Hobbit stooped for a stone, it was well to get quickly under cover,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">as all trespassing beasts knew very well.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">All Hobbits had originally lived in holes in the ground, or so they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">believed, and in such dwellings they still felt most at home; but in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">course of time they had been obliged to adopt other forms of abode. Actually<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in the Shire in Bilbo's days it was, as a rule, only the richest and the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">poorest Hobbits that maintained the old custom. The poorest went on living<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in burrows of the most primitive kind, mere holes indeed, with only one<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">window or none; while the well-to-do still constructed more luxurious<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">versions of the simple diggings of old. But suitable sites for these large<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and ramifying tunnels (or smicils as they called them) were not everywhere to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">be found; and in the flats and the low-lying districts the Hobbits, as they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">multiplied, began to build above ground. Indeed, even in the hilly regions<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and the older villages, such as Hobbiton or Tuckborough, or in the chief<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">township of the Shire, Michel Delving on the White Downs, there were now<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">many houses of wood, brick, or stone. These were specially favoured by<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">millers, smiths, ropers, and Cartwrights, and others of that sort; for even<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">when they had holes to live in. Hobbits had long been accustomed to build<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sheds and workshops.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The habit of building farmhouses and barns was said to have begun among<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the inhabitants of the Marish down by the Brandywine. The Hobbits of that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">quarter, the Eastfarthing, were rather large and heavy-legged, and they wore<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dwarf-boots in muddy weather. But they were well known to be Stoors in a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">large part of their blood, as indeed was shown by the down that many grew on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">their chins. No Harfoot or Fallohide had any trace of a beard. Indeed, the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">folk of the Marish, and of Buckland, east of the River, which they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">afterwards occupied, came for the most part later into the Shire up from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">south-away; and they still had many peculiar names and strange words not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">found elsewhere in the Shire.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It is probable that the craft of building, as many other crafts beside,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was derived from the DÂ®nedain. But the Hobbits may have learned it direct<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">from the Elves, the teachers of Men in their youth. For the Elves of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">High Kindred had not yet forsaken Middle-earth, and they dwelt still at that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">time at the Grey Havens away to the west, and in other places within reach<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of the Shire. Three Elf-towers of immemorial age were still to be seen on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Tower Hills beyond the western marches. They shone far off in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">moonlight. The tallest was furthest away, standing alone upon a green mound.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Hobbits of the Westfarthing said that one could see the Sea from the lop<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of that tower; but no Hobbit had ever been known to climb it. Indeed, few<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Hobbits had ever seen or sailed upon the Sea, and fewer still had ever<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">returned to report it. Most Hobbits regarded even rivers and small boats<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with deep misgivings, and not many of them could swim. And as the days of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Shire lengthened they spoke less and less with the Elves, and grew<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">afraid of them, and distrustful of those that had dealings with them; and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Sea became a word of fear among them, and a token of death, and they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">turned their faces away from the hills in the west.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The craft of building may have come from Elves or Men, but the Hobbits<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">used it in their own fashion. They did not go in for towers. Their houses<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were usually long, low, and comfortable. The oldest kind were, indeed, no<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">more than built imitations of smials, thatched with dry grass or straw, or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">roofed with turves, and having walls somewhat bulged. That stage, however,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">belonged to the early days of the Shire, and hobbit -building had long since<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">been altered, improved by devices, learned from Dwarves, or discovered by<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">themselves. A preference for round windows, and even round doors, was the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">chief remaining peculiarity of hobbit-architecture.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The houses and the holes of Shire-hobbits were often large, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">inhabited by large families. (Bilbo and Frodo Baggins were as bachelors very<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">exceptional, as they were also in many other ways, such as their friendship<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with the Elves.) Sometimes, as in the case of the Tooks of Great Smials, or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Brandybucks of Brandy Hall, many generations of relatives lived in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">(comparative) peace together in one ancestral and many -tunnelled mansion.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">All Hobbits were, in any case, clannish and reckoned up their relationships<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with great care. They drew long and elaborate family -trees with innumerable<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">branches. In dealing with Hobbits it is important to remember who is related<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to whom, and in what degree. It would be impossible in this book to set out<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a family -tree that included even the more important members of the more<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">important families at the time which these tales tell of. The genealogical<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">trees at the end of the Red Book of Westmarch are a small book in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">themselves, and all but Hobbits would find them exceedingly dull. Hobbits<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">delighted in such things, if they were accurate: they liked to have books<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">filled with things that they already knew, set out fair and square with no<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">contradictions.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There is another astonishing thing about Hobbits of old that must be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mentioned, an astonishing habit: they imbibed or inhaled, through pipes of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">clay or wood, the smoke of the burning leaves of a herb, which they called<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">pipe-weed or leaf, a variety probably of Nicotiana. A great deal of mystery<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">surrounds the origin of this peculiar custom, or 'art' as the Hobbits<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">preferred to call it. All that could be discovered about it in antiquity was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">put together by Meriadoc Brandybuck (later Master of Buckland), and since he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and the tobacco of the Southfarthing play a part in the history that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">follows, his remarks in the introduction to his Herblore of the Shire may be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">quoted.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™This,' he says, 'is the one art that we can certainly claim to be our<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">own invention. When Hobbits first began to smoke is not known, all the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">legends and family histories take it for granted; for ages folk in the Shire<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">smoked various herbs, some fouler, some sweeter. But all accounts agree that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Tobold Hornblower of Longbottom in the Southfarthing first grew the true<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">pipe-weed in his gardens in the days of Isengrim the Second, about the year<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">1070 of Shire-reckoning. The best home-grown still comes from that district,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">especially the varieties now known as Longbottom Leaf, Old Toby, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Southern Star.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'How Old Toby came by the plant is not recorded, for to his dying day<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he would not tell. He knew much about herbs, but he was no traveller. It is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">said that in his youth he went often to Bree, though he certainly never went<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">further from the Shire than that. It is thus quite possible that he learned<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of this plant in Bree, where now, at any rate, it grows well on the south<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">slopes of the hill. The Bree-hobbits claim to have been the first actual<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">smokers of the pipe-weed. They claim, of course, to have done everything<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">before the people of the Shire, whom they refer to as "colonists"; but in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">this case their claim is, I think, likely to be true. And certainly it was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">from Bree that the art of smoking the genuine weed spread in the recent<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">centuries among Dwarves and such other folk, Rangers, Wizards, or wanderers,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">as still passed to and fro through that ancient road-meeting. The home and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">centre of the an is thus to be found in the old inn of Bree, The Prancing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'All the same, observations that I have made on my own many journeys<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">suspect, originally brought over Sea by the Men of Westernesse. It grows<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">abundantly in Gondor, and there is richer and larger than in the North,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">for the fragrance of its flowers. From that land it must have been carried<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">up the Greenway during the long centuries between the coming of Elendil and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">our own day. But even the DÂ®nedain of Gondor allow us this credit: Hobbits<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">first put it into pipes. Not even the Wizards first thought of that before<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">we did. Though one Wizard that I knew took up the art long ago, and became<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">as skilful in it as in all other things that he put his mind to.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">3. Of the Ordering of the Shire<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Shire was divided into four quarters, the Farthings already<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">referred to. North, South, East, and West; and these again each into a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">number of folklands, which still bore the names of some of the old leading<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">families, although by the time of this history these names were no longer<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">found only in their proper folklands. Nearly all Tooks still lived in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Tookland, but that was not true of many other families, such as the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bagginses or the Boffins. Outside the Farthings were the East and West<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Marches: the Buckland (see beginning of Chapter V, Book I); and the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Westmarch added to the Shire in S.R. 1462.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Shire at this time had hardly any 'government'. Families for the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">most part managed their own affairs. Growing food and eating it occupied<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">most of their time. In other matters they were, as a rule, generous and not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">greedy, but contented and moderate, so that estates, farms, workshops, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">small trades tended to remain unchanged for generations.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There remained, of course, the ancient tradition concerning the high<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">king at Fornost, or Norbury as they called it, away north of the Shire. But<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">there had been no king for nearly a thousand years, and even the ruins of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Kings' Norbury were covered with grass. Yet the Hobbits still said of wild<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">folk and wicked things (such as trolls) that they had not heard of the king.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For they attributed to the king of old all their essential laws; and usually<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they kept the laws of free will, because they were The Rules (as they said),<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">both ancient and just.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It is true that the Took family had long been pre-eminent; for the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">office of Thain had passed to them (from the Oldbucks) some centuries<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">before, and the chief Took had borne that title ever since. The Thain was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the master of the Shire-moot, and captain of the Shire-muster and the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Hobbitry-in-arms, but as muster and moot were only held in times of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">emergency, which no longer occurred, the Thainship had ceased to be more<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">than a nominal dignity. The Took family was still, indeed, accorded a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">special respect, for it remained both numerous and exceedingly wealthy, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was liable to produce in every generation strong characters of peculiar<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">habits and even adventurous temperament. The latter qualities, however, were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">now rather tolerated (in the rich) than generally approved. The custom<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">endured, nonetheless, of referring to the head of the family as The Took,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and of adding to his name, if required, a number: such as Isengrim the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Second, for instance.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The only real official in the Shire at this date was the Mayor of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Michel Delving (or of the Shire), who was elected every seven years at the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Free Fair on the White Downs at the Lithe, that is at Midsummer. As mayor<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">almost his only duty was to preside at banquets, given on the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Shire-holidays, which occurred at frequent intervals. But the offices of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Postmaster and First Shirriff were attached to the mayoralty, so that he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">managed both the Messenger Service and the Watch. These were the only<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Shire-services, and the Messengers were the most numerous, and much the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">busier of the two. By no means all Hobbits were lettered, but those who were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wrote constantly to all their friends (and a selection of their relations)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">who lived further off than an afternoon's walk.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Shirriffs was the name that the Hobbits gave to their police, or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the nearest equivalent that they possessed. They had, of course, no uniforms<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">(such things being quite unknown), only a feather in their caps; and they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were in practice rather haywards than policemen, more concerned with the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">strayings of beasts than of people. There were in all the Shire only twelve<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of them, three in each Farthing, for Inside Work. A rather larger body,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">varying at need, was employed to 'beat the boundsâ€™, and to see that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Outsiders of any kind, great or small, did not make themselves a nuisance.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At the time when this story begins the Bounders, as they were called,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">had been greatly increased. There were many reports and complaints of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">strange persons and creatures prowling about the borders, or over them: the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">first sign that all was not quite as it should be, and always had been<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">except in tales and legends of long ago. Few heeded the sign, and not even<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bilbo yet had any notion of what it portended. Sixty years had passed since<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he set out on his memorable journey, and he was old even for Hobbits, who<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">reached a hundred as often as not; but much evidently still remained of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">considerable wealth that he had brought back. How much or how little he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">revealed to no one, not even to Frodo his favourite 'nephew'. And he still<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">kept secret the ring that he bad found.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">4. Of the Finding of the Ring<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As is told in The Hobbit , there came one day to Bilbo's door the great<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Wizard, Gandalf the Grey, and thirteen dwarves with him: none other, indeed,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">than Thorin Oakenshield, descendant of kings, and his twelve companions in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">exile. With them he set out, to his own lasting astonishment, on a morning<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of April, it being then the year 1341 Shire-reckoning, on a quest of great<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">treasure, the dwarf-hoards of the Kings under the Mountain, beneath Erebor<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in Dale, far off in the East. The quest was successful, and the Dragon that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">guarded the hoard was destroyed. Yet, though before all was won the Battle<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of Five Armies was fought, and Thorin was slain, and many deeds of renown<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were done, the matter would scarcely have concerned later history, or earned<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">more than a note in the long annals of the Third Age, but for an 'accident'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">by the way. The party was assailed by Ores in a high pass of the Misty<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mountains as they went towards Wilderland; and so it happened that Bilbo was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">lost for a while in the black ore-mines deep under the mountains, and there,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">as he groped in vain in the dark, he put his hand on a ring, lying on the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">floor of a tunnel. Ele put it in his pocket. It seemed then like mere luck.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Trying to find his way out. Bilbo went on down to the roots of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mountains, until he could go no further. At the bottom of the tunnel lay a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">cold lake far from the light, and on an island of rock in the water lived<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gollum. He was a loathsome little creature: he paddled a small boat with his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">large flat feet, peering with pale luminous eyes and catching blind fish<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with his long fingers, and eating them raw. He ate any living thing, even<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ore, if he could catch it and strangle it without a struggle. He possessed a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">secret treasure that had come to him long ages ago, when he still lived in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the light: a ring of gold that made its wearer invisible. It was the one<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">thing he loved, his 'precious', and he talked to it, even when it was not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with him. For he kept it hidden safe in a hole on his island, except when he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was hunting or spying on the ores of the mines.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Maybe he would have attacked Bilbo at once, if the ring had been on him<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">when they met; but it was not, and the hobbit held in his hand an Elvish<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">knife, which served him as a sword. So to gain time Gollum challenged Bilbo<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to the Riddle-game, saying that if he asked a riddle which Bilbo could not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">guess, then he would kill him and eat him; but if Bilbo defeated him, then<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he would do as Bilbo wished: he would lead him to a way out of the tunnels.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Since he was lost in the dark without hope, and could neither go on nor<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">back. Bilbo accepted the challenge; and they asked one another many riddles.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the end Bilbo won the game, more by luck (as it seemed) than by wits; for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he was stumped at last for a riddle to ask, and cried out, as his hand came<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">upon the ring he lad picked up and forgotten: What haw I got in my pocket?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">This Gollum failed to answer, though he demanded three guesses.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Authorities, it is true, differ whether this last question was a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mere 'question' and not a 'riddle' according to the strict rules of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Game; but all agree that, after accepting it and trying to guess the answer,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gollum was bound by his promise. And Bilbo pressed him to keep his word;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the thought came to him that this slimy creature might prove false, even<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">though such promises were held sacred, and of old all but the wickedest<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">things feared to break them. But after ages alone in the dark Gollum's heart<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was black, and treachery was in it. He slipped away, and returned to the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">island, of which Bilbo knew nothing, not far off in the dark water. There,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he thought, lay his ring. He was hungry now, and angry, and once his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'precious' was with him he would not fear any weapon at all.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But the ring was not on the island; he had lost it, it was gone. His<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">screech sent a shiver down Bilbo's back, though he did not yet understand<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">what had happened. But Gollum had at last leaped to a guess, too late. What<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">has it got in its pocketses? he cried. The light in his eyes was like a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">green flame as he sped back to murder the hobbit and recover his 'precious'.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Just in time Bilbo saw his peril, and he fled blindly up the passage away<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">from the water; and once more he was saved by his luck. For just as he ran<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he put his hand in his pocket, and the ring slipped quietly on to his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">finger. So it was that Gollum passed him without seeing him, and went to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">guard the way out, lest the 'thief should escape. Warily Bilbo followed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">him, as he went along, cursing, and talking to himself about his 'precious';<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">from which talk at last even Bilbo guessed the truth, and hope came to him<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in the darkness: he himself had found the marvellous ring and a chance of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">escape from the ores and from Gollum.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At length they came to a halt before an unseen opening that led to the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">lower gates of the mines, on the eastward side of the mountains. There<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gollum crouched at bay, smelling and listening; and Bilbo was tempted to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">slay him with his sword. But pity stayed him, and though he kept the ring,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in which his only hope lay, he would not use it to help him kill the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wretched creature at a disadvantage. In the end, gathering his courage, he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">leaped over Gollum in the dark, and fled away down the passage, pursued by<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his enemy's cries of hate and despair: Thief thief! Baggins! We hates it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">for ever!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Now it is a curious fact that this is not the story as Bilbo first told<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it to his companions. To them his account was that Gollum had promised to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">give him a present, if he won the game; but when Gollum went to fetch it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">from his island he found the treasure was gone: a magic ring, which had been<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">given to him long ago on his birthday. Bilbo guessed that this was the very<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ring that he had found, and as he had won the game, it was already his by<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">right. But being in a tight place, he said nothing about it, and made Gollum<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">show him the way out, as a reward instead of a present. This account Bilbo<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">set down in his memoirs, and he seems never to have altered it himself, not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">even after the Council of Elrond. Evidently it still appeared in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">original Red Book, as it did in several of the copies and abstracts. But<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">many copies contain the true account (as an alternative), derived no doubt<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">from notes by Frodo or Samwise, both of whom learned the truth, though they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">seem to have been unwilling to delete anything actually written by the old<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hobbit himself.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gandalf, however, disbelieved Bilbo's first story, as soon as he heard<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it, and he continued to be very curious about the ring. Eventually he got<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the true tale out of Bilbo after much questioning, which for a while<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">strained their friendship; but the wizard seemed to think the truth<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">important. Though he did not say so to Bilbo, he also thought it important,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and disturbing, to find that the good hobbit had not told the truth from the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">first: quite contrary to his habit. The idea of a 'present' was not mere<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hobbitlike invention, all the same. It was suggested to Bilbo, as he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">confessed, by Gollum's talk that he overheard; for Gollum did, in fact, call<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the ring his 'birthday present', many times. That also Gandalf thought<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">strange and suspicious; but he did not discover the truth in this point for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">many more years, as will be seen in this book.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Of Bilbo's later adventures little more need be said here. With the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">help of the ring he escaped from the ore-guards at the gate and rejoined his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">companions. He used the ring many times on his quest, chiefly for the help<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of his friends; but he kept it secret from them as long as he could. After<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and Frodo; and no one else in the Shire knew of its existence, or so he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">believed. Only to Frodo did he show the account of his Journey that he was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">writing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">marvellous mail, the gift of the Dwarves from the Dragon -hoard, he lent to a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">museum, to the Michel Delving Mathom-house in fact. But he kept in a drawer<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">at Bag End the old cloak and hood that he had worn on his travels; and the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At the end of the Third Age the part played by the Hobbits in the great<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">events that led to the inclusion of the Shire in the Reunited Kingdom<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">awakened among them a more widespread interest in their own history; and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">many of their traditions, up to that time still mainly oral, were collected<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and Written down. The greater families were also concerned with events in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Kingdom at large, and many of their members studied its ancient<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">histories and legends. By the end of the first century of the Fourth Age<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">there were already to be found in the Shire several libraries that contained<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">many historical books and records.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The largest of these collections were probably at Undertowers, at Great<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Smials, and at Brandy Hall. This account of the end of the Third Age is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">drawn mainly from the Red Book of Westmarch. That most important source<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the history of the War of the Ring was so called because it was long<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">preserved at Undertowers, the home of the Fairbairns, Wardens of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Westmarch. 1 It was in origin Bilbo's private diary, which he took with him<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to Rivendell. Frodo brought it back to the Shire, together with many loose<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">leaves of notes, and during S.R. 1420-1 he nearly filled its pages with his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">account of the War. But annexed to it and preserved with it, probably m a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">single red case, were the three large volumes, bound in red leather, that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bilbo gave to him as a parting gift. To these four volumes there was added<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in Westmarch a fifth containing commentaries, genealogies, and various other<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">matter concerning the hobbit members of the Fellowship.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The original Red Book has not been preserved, but many copies were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">made, especially of the first volume, for the use of the descendants of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">children of Master Samwise. The most important copy, however, has a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">different history. It was kept at Great Smials, but it was written in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Condor, probably at the request of the great-grandson of Peregrin, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">completed in S.R. 1592 (F.A. 172). Its southern scribe appended this note:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Findegil, King's Writer, finished this work in IV 172. It is an exact copy<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in all details of the Thain's Book m Minas Tirith. That book was a copy,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">made at the request of King Elessar, of the Red Book of the Periannath, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was brought to him by the Thain Peregrin when he retired to Gondor in IV 64.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Thainâ€™s Book was thus the first copy made of the Red Book and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">contained much that was later omitted or lost. In Minas Tirith it received<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">much annotation, and many corrections, especially of names, words, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">quotations in the Elvish languages; and there was added to it an abbreviated<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">version of those parts of The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen which lie outside<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the account of the War. The full tale is stated to have been written by<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Barahir, grandson of the Steward Faramir, some time after the passing of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">King. But the chief importance of Findegilâ€™s copy is that it alone contains<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the whole of Bilbo's â€™Translations from the Elvish'. These three volumes<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were found to be a work of great skill and learning in which, between 1403<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and 1418, he had used all the sources available to him in Rivendell, both<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">living and written. But since they were little used by Frodo, being almost<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">entirely concerned with the Elder Days, no more is said of them here.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Since Meriadoc and Peregrin became the heads of their great families,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and at the same time kept up their connexions with Rohan and Gondor, the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">libraries at Bucklebury and Tuckborough contained much that did not appear<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in the Red Book. In Brandy Hall there were many works dealing with Eriador<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and the history of Rohan. Some of these were composed or begun by<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Meriadoc<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">himself, though in the Shire he was chiefly remembered for his Herhlore of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Shire, and for his Reckoning of Years m which he discussed the relation<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of the calendars of the Shire and Bree to those of Rivendell, Gondor, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Rohan. He also wrote a short treatise on Old Words and Names in the Shire,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">having special interest in discovering the kinship with the language of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Rohirrim of such 'shire-words' as mathom and old elements in place names.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At Great Smials the books were of less interest to Shire-folk, though<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">more important for larger history. None of them was written by Peregrin, but<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he and his successors collected many manuscripts written by scribes of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gondor: mainly copies or summaries of histories or legends relating to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Elendil and his heirs. Only here in the Shire were to be found extensive<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">materials for the history of NÂ®menor and the arising of Sauron. It was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">probably at Great Smials that The Tale of Years 1 was put together, with the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">assistance of material collected by Meriadoc. Though the dates given are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">often conjectural, especially for the Second Age, they deserve attention. It<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">is probable that Meriadoc obtained assistance and information from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Rivendell, which he visited more than once. There, though Elrond had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">When Mr. Bilbo Baggins of Bag End announced that he would shortly be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">celebrating his eleventy -first birthday with a party of special<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">magnificence, there was much talk and excitement in Hobbiton.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bilbo was very rich and very peculiar, and had been the wonder of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Shire for sixty years, ever since his remarkable disappearance and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">unexpected return. The riches he had brought back from his travels had now<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">become a local legend, and it was popularly believed, whatever the old folk<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">might say, that the Hill at Bag End was full of tunnels stuffed with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">treasure. And if that was not enough for fame, there was also his prolonged<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">vigour to marvel at. Time wore on, but it seemed to have little effect on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mr. Baggins. At ninety he was much the same as at fifty. At ninety-nine they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">began to call him we//-preserved, but unchanged would have been nearer the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mark. There were some that shook their heads and thought this was too much<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of a good thing; it seemed unfair that anyone should possess (apparently)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">perpetual youth as well as (reputedly) inexhaustible wealth.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'It will have to be paid for,' they said. 'It isn't natural, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">trouble will come of it!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But so far trouble had not come; and as Mr. Baggins was generous with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his money, most people were willing to forgive him his oddities and his good<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fortune. He remained on visiting terms with his relatives (except, of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">course, the Sackville-Bagginses), and he had many devoted admirers among<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hobbits of poor and unimportant families. But he had no close friends, until<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">some of his younger cousins began to grow up.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The eldest of these, and Bilbo's favourite, was young Frodo Baggins.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">When Bilbo was ninety-nine, he adopted Frodo as his heir, and brought him to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">live at Bag End; and the hopes of the Sackville-Bagginses were finally<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dashed. Bilbo and Frodo happened to have the same birthday, September<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">22nd.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You had better come and live here, Frodo my lad,' said Bilbo one day; 'and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">then we can celebrate our birthday-parties comfortably together.' At that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">time Frodo was still in his tweens, as the hobbits called the irresponsible<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">twenties between childhood and coming of age at thirty-three.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Twelve more years passed. Each year the Bagginses had given very lively<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">combined birthday-parties at Bag End; but now it was understood that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">something quite exceptional was being planned for that autumn. Bilbo was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">going to be eleventy-one, 111, a rather curious number and a very<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">respectable age for a hobbit (the Old Took himself had only reached 130);<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and Frodo was going to be thirty-three, 33) an important number: the date of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his 'coming of age'.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Tongues began to wag in Flobbiton and By water; and rumour of the coming<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">event travelled all over the Shire. The history and character of Mr. Bilbo<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Baggins became once again the chief topic of conversation; and the older<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">folk suddenly found their reminiscences in welcome demand.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">No one had a more attentive audience than old Ham Gamgee, commonly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">known as the Gaffer. He held forth at The Ivy Bush , a small inn on the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bywater road; and he spoke with some authority, for he had tended the garden<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">at Bag End for forty years, and had helped old Holman in the same job before<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that. Now that he was himself growing old and stiff in the joints, the job<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was mainly carried on by his youngest son, Sam Gamgee. Both father and son<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were on very friendly terms with Bilbo and Frodo. They lived on the Hill<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">itself, in Number 3 Bagshot Row just below Bag End.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™A very nice well-spoken gentlehobbit is Mr. Bilbo, as I've always<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">said,' the Gaffer declared. With perfect truth: for Bilbo was very polite to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">him, calling him 'Master Hamfast', and consulting him constantly upon the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">growing of vegetables - in the matter of 'roots', especially potatoes, the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gaffer was recognized as the leading authority by all in the neighbourhood<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">(including himself).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'But what about this Frodo that lives with him?' asked Old Noakes of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">By water. 'Baggins is his name, but he's more than half a Brandybuck, they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">say. It beats me why any Baggins of Hobbiton should go looking for a wife<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">away there in Buckland, where folks are so queer.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'And no wonder they're queer,' put in Daddy Twofoot (the Gaffer's<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">next-door neighbour), 'if they live on the wrong side of the Brandywine<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">River, and right agin the Old Forest. That's a dark bad place, if half the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">tales be true.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You're right, Dad!' said the Gaffer. 'Not that the Brandybucks of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Buck-land live in the Old Forest; but they're a queer breed, seemingly. They<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fool about with boats on that big river - and that isnâ€™t natural. Small<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wonder that trouble came of it, I say. But be that as it may, Mr. Frodo is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">as nice a young hobbit as you could wish to meet. Very much like Mr. Bilbo,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and in more than looks. After all his father was a Baggins. A decent<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">respectable hobbit was Mr. Drogo Baggins; there was never much to tell of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">him, till he was drownded.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Drownded?' said several voices. They had heard this and other darker<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">rumours before, of course; but hobbits have a passion for family history,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and they were ready to hear it again. 'Well, so they say,' said the Gaffer.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You see: Mr. Drogo, he married poor Miss Primula Brandybuck. She was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">our<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mr. Bilbo's first cousin on the mother's side (her mother being the youngest<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of the Old Took's daughters); and Mr. Drogo was his second cousin. So Mr.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo is his first and second cousin, once removed either way, as the saying<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">is, if you follow me. And Mr. Drogo was staying at Brandy Flail with his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">father-in-law, old Master Gorbadoc, as he often did after his marriage (him<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">being partial to his vittles, and old Gorbadoc keeping a mighty generous<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">table); and he went out boating on the Brandywine River; and he and his wife<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were drownded, and poor Mr. Frodo only a child and all. '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I've heard they went on the water after dinner in the moonlight,' said<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Old Noakes; 'and it was Drogo's weight as sunk the boat.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'And / heard she pushed him in, and he pulled her in after him,' said<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sandy man, the Hobbiton miller.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You shouldn't listen to all you hear, Sandyman,' said the Gaffer, who<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">did not much like the miller. 'There isn't no call to go talking of pushing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and pulling. Boats are quite tricky enough for those that sit still without<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">looking further for the cause of trouble. Anyway: there was this Mr. Frodo<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">left an orphan and stranded, as you might say, among those queer<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bucklanders, being brought up anyhow in Brandy Hall. A regular warren, by<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">all accounts. Old Master Gorbadoc never had fewer than a couple of hundred<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">relations in the place. Mr. Bilbo never did a kinder deed than when he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">brought the lad back to live among decent folk.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'But I reckon it was a nasty shock for those Sackville-Bagginses. They<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">thought they were going to get Bag End, that time when he went off and was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">thought to be dead. And then he comes back and orders them off; and he goes<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">on living and living, and never looking a day older, bless him! And suddenly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he produces an heir, and has all the papers made out proper. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sackville-Bagginses wonâ€™t never see the inside of Bag End now, or it is to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">be hoped not.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'There's a tidy bit of money tucked away up there, I hear tell,' said a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stranger, a visitor on business from Michel Delving in the Westfarthing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'All the top of your hill is full of tunnels packed with chests of gold and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">silver, and jools, by what I've heard. '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Then you've heard more than I can speak to,' answered the Gaffer. I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">know nothing about jools. Mr. Bilbo is free with his money, and there seems<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">no lack of it; but I know of no tunnel -making. I saw Mr. Bilbo when he came<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">back, a matter of sixty years ago, when I was a lad. I'd not long come<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">prentice to old Holman (him being my dad's cousin), but he had me up at Bag<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">End helping him to keep folks from trampling and trapessing all over the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">garden while the sale was on. And in the middle of it all Mr. Bilbo comes up<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Hill with a pony and some mighty big bags and a couple of chests. I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">don't doubt they were mostly full of treasure he had picked up in foreign<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">parts, where there be mountains of gold, they say; but there wasn't enough<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to fill tunnels. But my lad Sam will know more about that. He's in and out<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of Bag End. Crazy about stories of the old days he is, and he listens to all<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mr. Bilbo's tales. Mr. Bilbo has learned him his letters - meaning no harm,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mark you, and I hope no harm will come of it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Elves and Dragons' Isays to him. 'Cabbages and potatoes are better<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">for me and you. Don 't go getting mixed up in the business of your betters,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">or you'll land in trouble too big for you, ' I says to him. And I might say<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it to others,' he added with a look at the stranger and the miller.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But the Gaffer did not convince his audience. The legend of Bilbo's<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wealth was now too firmly fixed in the minds of the younger generation of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hobbits.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Ah, but he has likely enough been adding to what he brought at first,'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">argued the miller, voicing common opinion. 'He's often away from home. And<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">look at the outlandish folk that visit him: dwarves coming at night, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that old wandering conjuror, Gandalf, and all. You can say what you like,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gaffer, but Bag End's a queer place, and its folk are queerer.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'And you can say what you like, about what you know no more of than you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">do of boating, Mr. Sandyman,' retorted the Gaffer, disliking the miller even<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">more than usual. If that's being queer, then we could do with a bit more<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">queerness in these parts. There's some not far away that wouldn't offer a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">pint of beer to a friend, if they lived in a hole with golden walls. But<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>

</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they do things proper at Bag End. Our Sam says that everyone's going to be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">invited to the party, and thereâ€™s going to be presents, mark you, presents<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">for all - this very month as is.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">That very month was September, and as fine as you could ask. A day or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">two later a rumour (probably started by the knowledgeable Sam) was spread<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">about that there were going to be fireworks - fireworks, what is more, such<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">as had not been seen in the Shire for nigh on a century, not indeed since<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Old Took died.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Days passed and The Day drew nearer. An odd-looking waggon laden with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">odd-looking packages rolled into Hobbiton one evening and toiled up the Hill<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to Bag End. The startled hobbits peered out of lamplit doors to gape at it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It was driven by outlandish folk, singing strange songs: dwarves with long<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">beards and deep hoods. A few of them remained at Bag End. At the end of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">second week in September a cart came in through Bywater from the direction<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of the Brandywine Bridge in broad daylight. An old man was driving it all<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">alone. He wore a tall pointed blue hat, a long grey cloak, and a silver<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">scarf. He had a long white beard and bushy eyebrows that stuck out beyond<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the brim of his hat. Small hobbit-children ran after the cart all through<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Hobbiton and right up the hill. It had a cargo of fireworks, as they rightly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">guessed. At Bilbo's front door the old man began to unload: there were great<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">bundles of fireworks of all sorts and shapes, each labelled with a large red<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">G and the elf-rune, .<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">That was Gandalf s mark, of course, and the old man was Gandalf the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Wizard, whose fame in the Shire was due mainly to his skill with fires,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">smokes, and lights. His real business was far more difficult and dangerous,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">but the Shire-folk knew nothing about it. To them he was just one of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'attractions' at the Party. Hence the excitement of the hobbit-children. 'G<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">for Grand!' they shouted, and the old man smiled. They knew him by sight,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">though he only appeared in Hobbiton occasionally and never stopped long; but<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">neither they nor any but the oldest of their elders had seen one of his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">firework displays - they now belonged to the legendary past.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">When the old man, helped by Bilbo and some dwarves, had finished<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">unloading. Bilbo gave a few pennies away; but not a single squib or cracker<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was forthcoming, to the disappointment of the onlookers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Run away now!' said Gandalf. 'You will get plenty when the time<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">comes.' Then he disappeared inside with Bilbo, and the door was shut. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">young hobbits stared at the door in vain for a while, and then made off,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">feeling that the day of the party would never come.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Inside Bag End, Bilbo and Gandalf were sitting at the open window of a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">small room looking out west on to the garden. The late afternoon was bright<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and peaceful. The flowers glowed red and golden: snap-dragons and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sun-flowers, and nasturtiums trailing all over the turf walls and peeping in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">at the round windows.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'How bright your garden looks!' said Gandalf.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Yes,' said Bilbo. I am very fond indeed of it, and of all the dear old<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Shire; but I think I need a holiday.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You mean to go on with your plan then?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I do. I made up my mind months ago, and I haven't changed it.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Very well. It is no good saying any more. Stick to your plan - your<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">whole plan, mind - and I hope it will turn out for the best, for you, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">for all of us.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I hope so. Anyway I mean to enjoy myself on Thursday, and have my<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">little joke.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Who will laugh, I wonder?' said Gandalf, shaking his head.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'We shall see,' said Bilbo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The next day more carts rolled up the Hill, and still more carts. There<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">might have been some grumbling about 'dealing locally', but that very week<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">orders began to pour out of Bag End for every kind of provision, commodity,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">or luxury that could be obtained in Hobbiton or Bywater or anywhere in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">neighbourhood. People became enthusiastic; and they began to tick off the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">days on the calendar; and they watched eagerly for the postman, hoping for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">invitations.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Before long the invitations began pouring out, and the Hobbiton<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">post-office was blocked, and the Bywater post-office was snowed under, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">voluntary assistant postmen were called for. There was a constant stream of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">them going up the Hill, carrying hundreds of polite variations on Thank you,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I shall certainly come.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A notice appeared on the gate at Bag End: NO ADMITTANCE EXCEPT<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ON PARTY<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">BUSINESS. Even those who had, or pretended to have Party Business were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">seldom allowed inside. Bilbo was busy: writing invitations, ticking off<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">answers, packing up presents, and making some private preparations of his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">own. From the time of Gandalf s arrival he remained hidden from view.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">One morning the hobbits woke to find the large field, south of Bilbo's<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">front door, covered with ropes and poles for tents and pavilions. A special<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">entrance was cut into the bank leading to the road, and wide steps and a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">large white gate were built there. The three hobbit-families of Bagshot Row,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">adjoining the field, were intensely interested and generally envied. Old<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gaffer Gamgee stopped even pretending to work in his garden.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The tents began to go up. There was a specially large pavilion, so big<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that the tree that grew in the field was right inside it, and stood proudly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">near one end, at the head of the chief table. Lanterns were hung on all its<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">branches. More promising still (to the hobbitsâ€™ mind): an enormous open-air<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">kitchen was erected in the north corner of the field. A draught of cooks,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">from every inn and eating-house for miles around, arrived to supplement the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dwarves and other odd folk that were quartered at Bag End. Excitement rose<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to its height.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Then the weather clouded over. That was on Wednesday the eve of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Party. Anxiety was intense. Then Thursday, September the 22nd, actually<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dawned. The sun got up, the clouds vanished, flags were unfurled and the fun<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">began.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bilbo Baggins called it a party, but it was really a variety of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">entertainments rolled into one. Practically everybody living near was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">invited. A very few were overlooked by accident, but as they turned up all<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the same, that did not matter. Many people from other parts of the Shire<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were also asked; and there were even a few from outside the borders. Bilbo<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">met the guests (and additions) at the new white gate in person. Ele gave away<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">presents to all and sundry - the latter were those who went out again by a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">back way and came in again by the gate. Hobbits give presents to other<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">people on their own birthdays. Not very expensive ones, as a rule, and not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">so lavishly as on this occasion; but it was not a bad system. Actually in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Hobbiton and Bywater every day in the year it was somebodyâ€™s birthday, so<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that every hobbit in those parts had a fair chance of at least one present<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">at least once a week. But they never got tired of them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">On this occasion the presents were unusually good. The hobbit-children<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were so excited that for a while they almost forgot about eating. There were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">toys the like of which they had never seen before, all beautiful and some<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">obviously magical. Many of them had indeed been ordered a year before, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">had come all the way from the Mountain and from Dale, and were of real<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dwarf-make.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">When every guest had been welcomed and was finally inside the gate,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">there were songs, dances, music, games, and, of course, food and drink.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There were three official meals: lunch, tea, and dinner (or supper). But<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">lunch and tea were marked chiefly by the fact that at those times all the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">guests were sitting down and eating together. At other times there were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">merely lots of people eating and drinking - continuously from elevenses<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">until six-thirty, when the fireworks started.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The fireworks were by Gandalf: they were not only brought by him, but<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">designed and made by him; and the special effects, set pieces, and flights<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of rockets were let off by him. But there was also a generous distribution<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of squibs, crackers, backarappers, sparklers, torches, dwarf-candles,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">elf-fountains, goblin -barkers and thunder -claps. They were all superb. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">art of Gandalf improved with age.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There were rockets like a flight of scintillating birds singing with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sweet voices. There were green trees with trunks of dark smoke: their leaves<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">opened like a whole spring unfolding in a moment, and their shining branches<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dropped glowing flowers down upon the astonished hobbits, disappearing with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a sweet scent just before they touched their upturned faces. There were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fountains of butterflies that flew glittering into the trees; there were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">pillars of coloured fires that rose and turned into eagles, or sailing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ships, or a phalanx of flying swans; there was a red thunderstorm and a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shower of yellow rain; there was a forest of silver spears that sprang<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">suddenly into the air with a yell like an embattled army, and came down<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">again into the Water with a hiss like a hundred hot snakes. And there was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">also one last surprise, in honour of Bilbo, and it startled the hobbits<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">exceedingly, as Gandalf intended. The lights went out. A great smoke went<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">up. It shaped itself like a mountain seen in the distance, and began to glow<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">at the summit. It spouted green and scarlet flames. Out flew a red -golden<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dragon - not life-size, but terribly life-like: fire came from his jaws, his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">eyes glared down; there was a roar, and he whizzed three times over the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">heads of the crowd. They all ducked, and many fell flat on their faces. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dragon passed like an express train, turned a somersault, and burst over<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bywater with a deafening explosion.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">That is the signal for supper!' said Bilbo. The pain and alarm<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">vanished at once, and the prostrate hobbits leaped to their feet. There was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a splendid supper for everyone; for everyone, that is, except those invited<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to the special family dinner-party. This was held in the great pavilion with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the tree. The invitations were limited to twelve dozen (a number also called<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">by the hobbits one Gross, though the word was not considered proper to use<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of people); and the guests were selected from all the families to which<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bilbo and Frodo were related, with the addition of a few special unrelated<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">friends (such as Gandalf). Many young hobbits were included, and present by<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">parental permission; for hobbits were easy-going with their children in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">matter of sitting up late, especially when there was a chance of getting<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">them a free meal. Bringing up young hobbits took a lot of provender.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There were many Bagginses and Boffins, and also many Tooks and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Brandybucks; there were various Grubbs (relations of Bilbo Baggins'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">grandmother), and various Chubbs (connexions of his Took grandfather); and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">selection of Burrowses, Bolgers, Bracegirdles, Brockhouses, Goodbodies,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Hornblowers and Proudfoots. Some of these were only very distantly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">connected<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with Bilbo, and some of them had hardly ever been in Hobbiton before, as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they lived in remote corners of the Shire. The Sackville-Bagginses were not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">forgotten. Otho and his wife Lobelia were present. They disliked Bilbo and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">detested Frodo, but so magnificent was the invitation card, written in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">golden ink, that they had felt it was impossible to refuse. Besides, their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">cousin, Bilbo, had been specializing in food for many years and his table<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">had a high reputation.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">All the one hundred and forty-four guests expected a pleasant feast;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">though they rather dreaded the after-dinner speech of their host (an<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">inevitable item). Fie was liable to drag in bits of what he called poetry;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and sometimes, after a glass or two, would allude to the absurd adventures<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of his mysterious journey. The guests were not disappointed: they had a very<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">pleasant feast, in fact an engrossing entertainment: rich, abundant, varied,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and prolonged. The purchase of provisions fell almost to nothing throughout<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the district in the ensuing weeks; but as Bilbo's catering had depleted the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stocks of most stores, cellars and warehouses for miles around, that did not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">matter much.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After the feast (more or less) came the Speech. Most of the company<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were, however, now in a tolerant mood, at that delightful stage which they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">called â€™filling up the cornersâ€™. They were sipping their favourite drinks,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and nibbling at their favourite dainties, and their fears were forgotten.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They were prepared to listen to anything, and to cheer at every full stop.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">My dear People, began Bilbo, rising in his place. â€™Flear! Flear! Hear!â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they shouted, and kept on repeating it in chorus, seeming reluctant to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">follow their own advice. Bilbo left his place and went and stood on a chair<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">under the illuminated tree. The light of the lanterns fell on his beaming<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">face; the golden buttons shone on his embroidered silk waistcoat. They could<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">all see him standing, waving one hand in the air, the other was in his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">trouser -pocket.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">My dear Bagginses and Boffins, he began again; and my dear Tooks and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Brandybucks, and Grubbs, and Chubbs, and Burrowses, and Hornblowers,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bolgers, Bracegirdles, Goodbodies, Brockhouses and Proudfoots.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'ProudFEET!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shouted an elderly hobbit from the back of the pavilion. His name, of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">course, was Proudfoot, and well merited; his feet were large, exceptionally<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">furry, and both were on the table.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Proudfoots, repeated Bilbo. Also my good Sackville-Bagginses that I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">welcome back at last to Bag End. Today is my one hundred and eleventh<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">birthday: I am eleventy -one today!' Hurray! Hurray! Many Happy Returns!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they shouted, and they hammered joyously on the tables. Bilbo was doing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">splendidly. This was the sort of stuff they liked: short and obvious.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I hope you are all enjoying yourselves as much as I am. Deafening<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">cheers. Cries of Yes (and No). Noises of trumpets and horns, pipes and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">flutes, and other musical instruments. There were, as has been said, many<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">young hobbits present. Hundreds of musical crackers had been pulled. Most of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">them bore the mark DALE on them; which did not convey much to most of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hobbits, but they all agreed they were marvellous crackers. They contained<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">instruments, small, but of perfect make and enchanting tones. Indeed, in one<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">corner some of the young Tooks and Brandybucks, supposing Uncle Bilbo to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">have finished (since he had plainly said all that was necessary), now got up<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">an impromptu orchestra, and began a merry dance-tune. Master Everard Took<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and Miss Melilot Brandybuck got on a table and with bells in their hands<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">began to dance the Springle-ring: a pretty dance, but rather vigorous.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But Bilbo had not finished. Seizing a horn from a youngster near by, he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">blew three loud hoots. The noise subsided. / shall not keep you long, he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">cried. Cheers from all the assembly. / have called you all together for a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Purpose. Something in the way that he said this made an impression. There<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was almost silence, and one or two of the Tooks pricked up their ears.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Indeed, for Three Purposes! First of all, to tell you that I am<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">immensely fond of you all, and that eleventy-one years is too short a time<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to live among such excellent and admirable hobbits. Tremendous outburst of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">approval.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">/ don 't know half of you half as well as I should like; and I like less<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">than half of you half as well as you deserve. This was unexpected and rather<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">difficult. There was some scattered clapping, but most of them were trying<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to work it out and see if it came to a compliment.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Secondly, to celebrate my birthday. Cheers again. I should say: OUR<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">birthday. For it is, of course, also the birthday of my heir and nephew,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo. He comes of age and into his inheritance today. Some perfunctory<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">clapping by the elders; and some loud shouts of â€™Frodo! Frodo! Jolly old<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo,' from the juniors. The Sackville-Bagginses scowled, and wondered what<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was meant by 'coming into his inheritance'. Together we score one hundred<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and forty-four. Your numbers were chosen to fit this remarkable total: One<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gross, if I may use the expression. No cheers. This was ridiculous. Many of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his guests, and especially the Sackville-Bagginses, were insulted, feeling<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sure they had only been asked to fill up the required number, like goods in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a package. 'One Gross, indeed! Vulgar expression.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It is also, if I may be allowed to refer to ancient history, the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">anniversary of my arrival by barrel at Esgaroth on the Long Lake; though the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fact that it was my birthday slipped my memory on that occasion. I was only<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fifty-one then, and birthdays did not seem so important. The banquet was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">very splendid, however, though I had a bad cold at the time, I remember, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">could only say 'thagyou very buch'. I now repeat it more correctly: Thank<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you very much for coming to my little party. Obstinate silence. They all<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">feared that a song or some poetry was now imminent; and they were getting<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">bored. Why couldn't he stop talking and let them drink his health? But Bilbo<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">did not sing or recite. Fie paused for a moment.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Thirdly and finally, he said, I wish to make an ANNOUNCEMENT. Fie<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">spoke<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">this last word so loudly and suddenly that everyone sat up who still could.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I regret to announce that - though, as I said, eleventy-one years is far too<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">short a time to spend among you - this is the END. I am going. I am leaving<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">NOW. GOOD-BYE 7<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He stepped down and vanished. There was a blinding flash of light, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the guests all blinked. When they opened their eyes Bilbo was nowhere to be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">seen. One hundred and forty-four flabbergasted hobbits sat back speechless.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Old Odo Proudfoot removed his feet from the table and stamped. Then there<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was a dead silence, until suddenly, after several deep breaths, every<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Baggins, Boffin, Took, Brandybuck, Grubb, Chubb, Burrows, Bolger,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bracegirdle, Brockhouse, Goodbody, Hornblower, and Proudfoot began to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">talk<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">at once.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It was generally agreed that the joke was in very bad taste, and more<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">food and drink were needed to cure the guests of shock and annoyance. 'He's<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mad. I always said so,' was probably the most popular comment. Even the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Tooks (with a few exceptions) thought Bilboâ€™s behaviour was absurd. For the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">moment most of them took it for granted that his disappearance was nothing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">more than a ridiculous prank.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But old Rory Brandybuck was not so sure. Neither age nor an enormous<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dinner had clouded his wits, and he said to his daughter-in-law, Esmeralda:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'There's something fishy in this, my dear! I believe that mad Baggins is off<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">again. Silly old fool. But why worry? He hasn't taken the vittles with him.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He called loudly to Frodo to send the wine round again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo was the only one present who had said nothing. For some time he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">had sat silent beside Bilbo's empty chair, and ignored all remarks and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">questions. He had enjoyed the joke, of course, even though he had been in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the know. He had difficulty in keeping from laughter at the indignant<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">surprise of the guests. But at the same time he felt deeply troubled: he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">realized suddenly that he loved the old hobbit dearly. Most of the guests<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">went on eating and drinking and discussing Bilbo Baggins' oddities, past and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">present; but the Sackville-Bagginses had already departed in wrath. Frodo<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">did not want to have any more to do with the party. He gave orders for more<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wine to be served; then he got up and drained his own glass silently to the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">health of Bilbo, and slipped out of the pavilion.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As for Bilbo Baggins, even while he was making his speech, he had been<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fingering the golden ring in his pocket: his magic ring that he had kept<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">secret for so many years. As he stepped down he slipped it on his finger,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and he was never seen by any hobbit in Hobbiton again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He walked briskly back to his hole, and stood for a moment listening<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with a smile to the din in the pavilion and to the sounds of merrymaking in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">other parts of the field. Then he went in. He took off his party clothes,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">folded up and wrapped in tissue-paper his embroidered silk waistcoat, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">put it away. Then he put on quickly some old untidy garments, and fastened<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">round his waist a worn leather belt. On it he hung a short sword in a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">battered black-leather scabbard. From a locked drawer, smelling of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">moth-balls, he took out an old cloak and hood. They had been locked up as if<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they were very precious, but they were so patched and weatherstained that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">their original colour could hardly be guessed: it might have been dark<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">green. They were rather too large for him. He then went into his study, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">from a large strong-box took out a bundle wrapped in old cloths, and a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">leather -bound manuscript; and also a large bulky envelope. The book and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">bundle he stuffed into the top of a heavy bag that was standing there,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">already nearly full. Into the envelope he slipped his golden ring, and its<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fine chain, and then sealed it, and addressed it to Frodo. At first he put<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it on the mantelpiece, but suddenly he removed it and stuck it in his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">pocket. At that moment the door opened and Gandalf came quickly in.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Hullo!' said Bilbo. 'I wondered if you would turn up.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I am glad to find you visible,' replied the wizard, sitting down in a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">chair, 'I wanted to catch you and have a few final words. I suppose you feel<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that everything has gone off splendidly and according to plan?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Yes, I do,' said Bilbo. "Though that flash was surprising: it quite<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">startled me, let alone the others. A little addition of your own, I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">suppose?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It was. You have wisely kept that ring secret all these years, and it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">seemed to me necessary to give your guests something else that would seem to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">explain your sudden vanishment.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'And would spoil my joke. You are an interfering old busybody,' laughed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bilbo, 'but I expect you know best, as usual.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I do - when I know anything. But I don't feel too sure about this<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">whole affair. It has now come to the final point. You have had your joke,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and alarmed or offended most of your relations, and given the whole Shire<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">something to talk about for nine days, or ninety-nine more likely. Are you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">going any further?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Yes, I am. I feel I need a holiday, a very long holiday, as I have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">told you before. Probably a permanent holiday: I don't expect I shall<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">return. In fact, I don't mean to, and I have made all arrangements.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I am old, Gandalf. I don't look it, but I am beginning to feel it in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">my heart of hearts. Well-preserved indeed!' he snorted. 'Why, I feel all<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">thin, sort of stretched, if you know what I mean: like butter that has been<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">scraped over too much bread. That can't be right. I need a change, or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">something.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gandalf looked curiously and closely at him. 'No, it does not seem<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">right,' he said thoughtfully. 'No, after all I believe your plan is probably<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the best.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well, I've made up my mind, anyway. I want to see mountains again,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gandalf, mountains, and then find somewhere where I can rest. In peace and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">quiet, without a lot of relatives prying around, and a string of confounded<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">visitors hanging on the bell. I might find somewhere where I can finish my<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">book. I have thought of a nice ending for it: and he lived happily ever<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">after to the end of his days. '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gandalf laughed. I hope he will. But nobody will read the book, however<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it ends.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Oh, they may, in years to come. Frodo has read some already, as far as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it has gone. You'll keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Yes, I will - two eyes, as often as I can spare them.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'He would come with me, of course, if I asked him. In fact he offered<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to once, just before the party. But he does not really want to, yet. I want<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to see the wild country again before I die, and the Mountains; but he is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">still in love with the Shire, with woods and fields and little rivers. He<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ought to be comfortable here. I am leaving everything to him, of course,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">except a few oddments. I hope he will be happy, when he gets used to being<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">on his own. It's time he was his own master now.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Everything?' said Gandalf. 'The ring as well? You agreed to that, you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">remember.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well, er, yes, I suppose so,' stammered Bilbo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Where is it?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'In an envelope, if you must know,' said Bilbo impatiently. 'There on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the mantelpiece. Well, no! Here it is in my pocket!' He hesitated. 'Isn't<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that odd now?' he said softly to himself. 'Yet after all, why not? Why<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shouldn't it stay there?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gandalf looked again very hard at Bilbo, and there was a gleam in his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">eyes. 'I think, Bilbo,' he said quietly, 'I should leave it behind. Don't<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you want to?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well yes - and no. Now it comes to it, I don't like parting with it at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">all, I may say. And I don't really see why I should. Why do you want me to?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he asked, and a curious change came over his voice. It was sharp with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">suspicion and annoyance. 'You are always badgering me about my ring; but<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">have never bothered me about the other things that I got on my journey.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'No, but I had to badger you,' said Gandalf. 'I wanted the truth. It<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was important. Magic rings are - well, magical; and they are rare and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">curious. I was professionally interested in your ring, you may say; and I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">still am. I should like to know where it is, if you go wandering again. Also<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I think you have had it quite long enough. You won't need it any more.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bilbo, unless I am quite mistaken.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bilbo flushed, and there was an angry light in his eyes. His kindly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">face grew hard. 'Why not?' he cried. 'And what business is it of yours,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">anyway, to know what I do with my own things? It is my own. I found it. It<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">came to me.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Yes, yes,' said Gandalf. 'But there is no need to get angry.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'If I am it is your fault,' said Bilbo. 'It is mine, I tell you. My<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">own. My precious. Yes, my precious.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The wizard's face remained grave and attentive, and only a flicker in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his deep eyes showed that he was startled and indeed alarmed. 'It has been<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">called that before,' he said, 'but not by you.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'But I say it now. And why not? Even if Gollum said the same once. It's<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">not his now, but mine. And I shall keep it, I say.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gandalf stood up. He spoke sternly. 'You will be a fool if you do.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bilbo,' he said. 'You make that clearer with every word you say. It has got<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">far too much hold on you. Let it go! And then you can go yourself, and be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">free.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I'll do as I choose and go as I please,' said Bilbo obstinately.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Now, now, my dear hobbit! ' said Gandalf. 'All your long life we have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">been friends, and you owe me something. Come! Do as you promised: give it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">up! '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well, if you want my ring yourself, say so!' cried Bilbo. 'But you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">won't get it. I won't give my precious away, I tell you.' His hand strayed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to the hilt of his small sword.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gandalf s eyes flashed. It will be my turn to get angry soon,' he said.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">If you say that again, I shall. Then you will see Gandalf the Grey<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">uncloaked.' He took a step towards the hobbit, and he seemed to grow tall<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and menacing; his shadow filled the little room.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bilbo backed away to the wall, breathing hard, his hand clutching at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his pocket. They stood for a while facing one another, and the air of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">room tingled. Gandalf s eyes remained bent on the hobbit. Slowly his hands<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">relaxed, and he began to tremble.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I donâ€™t know what has come over you, Gandalf,' he said. 'You have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">never been like this before. What is it all about? It is mine isn't it? I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">found it, and Gollum would have killed me, if I hadn't kept it. I'm not a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">thief, whatever he said.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I have never called you one,' Gandalf answered. 'And I am not one<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">either. I am not trying to rob you, but to help you. I wish you would trust<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">me, as you used.' He turned away, and the shadow passed. He seemed to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dwindle again to an old grey man, bent and troubled.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bilbo drew his hand over his eyes. I am sorry,' he said. 'But I felt so<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">queer. And yet it would be a relief in a way not to be bothered with it any<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">more. It has been so growing on my mind lately. Sometimes I have felt it was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">like an eye looking at me. And I am always wanting to put it on and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">disappear, don't you know; or wondering if it is safe, and pulling it out to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">make sure. I tried locking it up, but I found I couldn't rest without it in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">my pocket. I don't know why. And I don't seem able to make up my mind.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Then trust mine,' said Gandalf. 'It is quite made up. Go away and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">leave it behind. Stop possessing it. Give it to Frodo, and I will look after<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">him.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bilbo stood for a moment tense and undecided. Presently he sighed. 'All<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">right,' he said with an effort. I will.' Then he shrugged his shoulders, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">smiled rather ruefully. 'After all that's what this party business was all<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">about, really: to give away lots of birthday presents, and somehow make it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">easier to give it away at the same time. It hasn't made it any easier in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">end, but it would be a pity to waste all my preparations. It would quite<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">spoil the joke.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Indeed it would take away the only point I ever saw in the affair,'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">said Gandalf.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Very well,' said Bilbo, 'it goes to Frodo with all the rest.' He drew<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a deep breath. 'And now I really must be starting, or somebody else will<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">catch me. I have said good-bye, and I couldn't bear to do it all over<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">again.' He picked up his bag and moved to the door.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You have still got the ring in your pocket,' said the wizard. 'Well,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">so I have!' cried Bilbo. 'And my will and all the other documents too. You<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">had better take it and deliver it for me. That will be safest.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'No, donâ€™t give the ring to me,' said Gandalf. 'Put it on the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mantelpiece. It will be safe enough there, till Frodo comes. I shall wait<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">for him.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bilbo took out the envelope, but just as he was about to set it by the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">clock, his hand jerked back, and the packet fell on the floor. Before he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">could pick it up, the wizard stooped and seized it and set it in its place.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A spasm of anger passed swiftly over the hobbit's face again. Suddenly it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">gave way to a look of relief and a laugh. 'Well, that's that,' he said. 'Now<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I'm off!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They went out into the hall. Bilbo chose his favourite stick from the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stand; then he whistled. Three dwarves came out of different rooms where<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they had been busy.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Is everything ready?' asked Bilbo. 'Everything packed and labelled?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Everything,' they answered.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well, let's start then!' He stepped out of the front-door.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It was a fine night, and the black sky was dotted with stars. He looked<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">up, sniffing the air. 'What fun! What fun to be off again, off on the Road<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with dwarves ! This is what I have really been longing for, for years !<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Good-bye! ' he said, looking at his old home and bowing to the door.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Good-bye, Gandalf!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Good-bye, for the present, Bilbo. Take care of yourself! You are old<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">enough, and perhaps wise enough.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Take care! I don't care. Don't you worry about me! I am as happy now<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">as I have ever been, and that is saying a great deal. But the time has come.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I am being swept off my feet at last,' he added, and then in a low voice, as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">if to himself, he sang softly in the dark:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Road goes ever on and on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Down from the door where it began.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Now far ahead the Road has gone,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And I must follow, if I can,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Pursuing it with eager feet,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Until it joins some larger way<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Where many paths and errands meet.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And whither then? I cannot say.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He paused, silent for a moment. Then without another word he turned<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">away from the lights and voices in the fields and tents, and followed by his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">three companions went round into his garden, and trotted down the long<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sloping path. He jumped over a low place in the hedge at the bottom, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">took to the meadows, passing into the night like a rustle of wind in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">grass.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gandalf remained for a while staring after him into the darkness.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™Goodbye, my dear Bilbo - until our next meeting!' he said softly and went<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">back indoors.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo came in soon afterwards, and found him sitting in the dark, deep<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in thought. 'Has he gone?' he asked.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Yes,' answered Gandalf, 'he has gone at last.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">' I wish - 1 mean, I hoped until this evening that it was only a joke,'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">said Frodo. 'But I knew in my heart that he really meant to go. He always<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">used to joke about serious things. I wish I had come back sooner, just to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">see him off.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I think really he preferred slipping off quietly in the end,' said<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gandalf. 'Don't be too troubled. He'll be all right - now. He left a packet<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">for you. There it is!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo took the envelope from the mantelpiece, and glanced at it, but<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">did not open it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You'll find his will and all the other documents in there, I think,'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">said the wizard. 'You are the master of Bag End now. And also, I fancy,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you'll find a golden ring.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'The ring!' exclaimed Frodo. 'Has he left me that? I wonder why. Still,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it may be useful.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'It may, and it may not,' said Gandalf. 'I should not make use of it,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">if I were you. But keep it secret, and keep it safe! Now I am going to bed.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As master of Bag End Frodo felt it his painful duty to say good-bye to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the guests. Rumours of strange events had by now spread all over the field,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">but Frodo would only say no doubt everything will be cleared up in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">morning. About midnight carriages came for the important folk. One by one<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they rolled away, filled with full but very unsatisfied hobbits. Gardeners<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">came by arrangement, and removed in wheel-barrows those that had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">inadvertently remained behind.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Night slowly passed. The sun rose. The hobbits rose rather later.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Morning went on. People came and began (by orders) to clear away the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">pavilions and the tables and the chairs, and the spoons and knives and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">bottles and plates, and the lanterns, and the flowering shrubs in boxes, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the crumbs and cracker -paper, the forgotten bags and gloves and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">handkerchiefs, and the uneaten food (a very small item). Then a number of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">other people came (without orders): Bagginses, and Boffins, and Bolgers, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Tooks, and other guests that lived or were staying near. By mid-day, when<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">even the best-fed were out and about again, there was a large crowd at Bag<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">End, uninvited but not unexpected.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo was waiting on the step, smiling, but looking rather tired and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">worried. He welcomed all the callers, but he had not much more to say than<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">before. His reply to all inquiries was simply this: 'Mr. Bilbo Baggins has<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">gone away; as far as I know, for good.' Some of the visitors he invited to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">come inside, as Bilbo had left 'messages' for them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Inside in the hall there was piled a large assortment of packages and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">parcels and small articles of furniture. On every item there was a label<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">tied. There were several labels of this sort:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For ADELARD TOOK, for his VERY OWN, from Bilbo, on an umbrella.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Adelard<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">had carried off many unlabelled ones.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For DORA BAGGINS in memory of a LONG correspondence, with love<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bilbo, on a large waste-paper basket. Dora was Drogo's sister and the eldest<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">surviving female relative of Bilbo and Frodo; she was ninety-nine, and had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">written reams of good advice for more than half a century.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For MILO BURROWS, hoping it will be useful, from B.B., on a gold pen<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and ink-bottle. Milo never answered letters.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For ANGELICA'S use, from Uncle Bilbo, on a round convex mirror. She<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a young Baggins, and too obviously considered her face shapely.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For the collection of HUGO BRACEGIRDLE, from a contributor, on an<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">(empty) book -case. Hugo was a great borrower of books, and worse than usual<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">at returning them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For LOBELIA SACKVILLE-BAGGINS, as a PRESENT, on a case of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">silver<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">spoons. Bilbo believed that she had acquired a good many of his spoons,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">while he was away on his former journey. Fobelia knew that quite well. When<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">she arrived later in the day, she took the point at once, but she also took<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the spoons.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">This is only a small selection of the assembled presents. Bilbo's<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">residence had got rather cluttered up with things in the course of his long<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">life. It was a tendency of hobbit-holes to get cluttered up: for which the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">custom of giving so many birthday-presents was largely responsible. Not, of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">course, that the birthday-presents were always new, there were one or two<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">old mathoms of forgotten uses that had circulated all around the district;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">but Bilbo had usually given new presents, and kept those that he received.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The old hole was now being cleared a little.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Every one of the various parting gifts had labels, written out<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">personally by Bilbo, and several had some point, or some joke. But, of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">course, most of the things were given where they would be wanted and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">welcome. The poorer hobbits, and especially those of Bagshot Row, did very<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">well. Old Gaffer Gamgee got two sacks of potatoes, a new spade, a woollen<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">waistcoat, and a bottle of ointment for creaking joints. Old Rory<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Brandybuck, in return for much hospitality, got a dozen bottles of Old<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Winyards: a strong red wine from the Southfarthing, and now quite mature, as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it had been laid down by Bilbo's father. Rory quite forgave Bilbo, and voted<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">him a capital fellow after the first bottle.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There was plenty of everything left for Frodo. And, of course, all the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">chief treasures, as well as the books, pictures, and more than enough<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">furniture, were left in his possession. There was, however, no sign nor<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mention of money or jewellery: not a penny -piece or a glass bead was given<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">away.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo had a very trying time that afternoon. A false rumour that the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">whole household was being distributed free spread like wildfire; and before<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">long the place was packed with people who had no business there, but could<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">not be kept out. Fabels got torn off and mixed, and quarrels broke out. Some<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">people tried to do swaps and deals in the hall; and others tried to make off<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with minor items not addressed to them, or with anything that seemed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">unwanted or unwatched. The road to the gate was blocked with barrows and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">handcarts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the middle of the commotion the Sackville-Bagginses arrived. Frodo<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">had retired for a while and left his friend Merry Brandybuck to keep an eye<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">on things. When Otho loudly demanded to see Frodo, Merry bowed politely.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'He is indisposed,' he said. 'He is resting.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Hiding, you mean,' said Fobelia. 'Anyway we want to see him and we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mean to see him. Just go and tell him so!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Merry left them a long while in the hall, and they had time to discover<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">their parting gift of spoons. It did not improve their tempers. Eventually<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they were shown into the study. Frodo was sitting at a table with a lot of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">papers in front of him. He looked indisposed - to see Sackville-Bagginses at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">any rate; and he stood up, fidgeting with something in his pocket. But he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">spoke quite politely.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Sackville-Bagginses were rather offensive. They began by offering<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">him bad bargain-prices (as between friends) for various valuable and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">unlabelled things. When Frodo replied that only the things specially<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">directed by Bilbo were being given away, they said the whole affair was very<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fishy.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Only one thing is clear to me,' said Otho, 'and that is that you are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">doing exceedingly well out of it. I insist on seeing the will.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Otho would have been Bilbo's heir, but for the adoption of Frodo. He<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">read the will carefully and snorted. It was, unfortunately, very clear and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">correct (according to the legal customs of hobbits, which demand among other<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">things seven signatures of witnesses in red ink).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Foiled again!' he said to his wife. 'And after waiting sixty years.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Spoons? Fiddlesticks!' He snapped his fingers under Frodo's nose and slumped<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">off. But Lobelia was not so easily got rid of. A little later Frodo came out<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of the study to see how things were going on and found her still about the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">place, investigating nooks and comers and tapping the floors. He escorted<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">her firmly off the premises, after he had relieved her of several small (but<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">rather valuable) articles that had somehow fallen inside her umbrella. Her<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">face looked as if she was in the throes of thinking out a really crushing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">parting remark; but all she found to say, turning round on the step, was:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You'll live to regret it, young fellow! Why didn't you go too? You<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">don't belong here; you're no Baggins - you - you're a Brandybuck!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Did you hear that, Merry? That was an insult, if you like,' said Frodo<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">as he shut the door on her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'It was a compliment,' said Merry Brandybuck, 'and so, of course, not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">true.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Then they went round the hole, and evicted three young hobbits (two<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Boffins and a Bolger) who were knocking holes in the walls of one of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">cellars. Frodo also had a tussle with young Sancho Proudfoot (old Odo<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Proudfoot's grandson), who had begun an excavation in the larger pantry,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">where he thought there was an echo. The legend of Bilbo's gold excited both<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">curiosity and hope; for legendary gold (mysteriously obtained, if not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">positively ill-gotten), is, as every one knows, any one's for the finding<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">-unless the search is interrupted.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">When he had overcome Sancho and pushed him out, Frodo collapsed on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">chair in the hall. It's time to close the shop, Merry,' he said. 'Lock the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">door, and donâ€™t open it to anyone today, not even if they bring a battering<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ram.â€™ Then he went to revive himself with a belated cup of tea.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He had hardly sat down, when there came a soft knock at the front-door.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Lobelia again most likely,' he thought. 'She must have thought of something<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">really nasty, and have come back again to say it. It can wait.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He went on with his tea. The knock was repeated, much louder, but he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">took no notice. Suddenly the wizard's head appeared at the window.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'If you don't let me in, Frodo, I shall blow your door right down your<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hole and out through the hill,' he said.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'My dear Gandalf! Half a minute!' cried Frodo, running out of the room<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to the door. 'Come in! Come in! I thought it was Lobelia.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Then I forgive you. But I saw her some time ago, driving a pony-trap<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">towards Bywater with a face that would have curdled new milk.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'She had already nearly curdled me. Honestly, I nearly tried on Bilbo's<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ring. I longed to disappear.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Don't do that!' said Gandalf, sitting down. 'Do be careful of that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ring, Frodo ! In fact, it is partly about that that I have come to say a last<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">word.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well, what about it?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'What do you know already?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Only what Bilbo told me. I have heard his story: how he found it, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">how he used it: on his journey, I mean.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Which story, I wonder,' said Gandalf.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Oh, not what he told the dwarves and put in his book,' said Frodo. 'He<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">told me the true story soon after I came to live here. He said you had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">pestered him till he told you, so I had better know too. "No secrets between<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">us, Frodo," he said; "but they are not to go any further. It's mine<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">anyway.'"<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'That's interesting,' said Gandalf. 'Well, what did you think of it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">all?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'If you mean, inventing all that about a "present", well, I thought the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">true story much more likely, and I couldn't see the point of altering it at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">all. It was very unlike Bilbo to do so, anyway; and I thought it rather<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">odd.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'So did I. But odd things may happen to people that have such treasures<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">- if they use them. Let it be a warning to you to be very careful with it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It may have other powers than just making you vanish when you wish to.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I don't understand,' said Frodo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Neither do I,' answered the wizard. 'I have merely begun to wonder<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">about the ring, especially since last night. No need to worry. But if you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">take my advice you will use it very seldom, or not at all. At least I beg<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you not to use it in any way that will cause talk or rouse suspicion. I say<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">again: keep it safe, and keep it secret!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You are very mysterious! What are you afraid of?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I am not certain, so I will say no more. I may be able to tell you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">something when I come back. I am going off at once: so this is good-bye for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the present.' He got up.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'At once!' cried Frodo. 'Why, I thought you were staying on for at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">least a week. I was looking forward to your help.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I did mean to - but I have had to change my mind. I may be away for a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">good while; but I'll come and see you again, as soon as I can. Expect me<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">when you see me! I shall slip in quietly. I shan't often be visiting the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Shire openly again. I find that I have become rather unpopular. They say I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">am a nuisance and a disturber of the peace. Some people are actually<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">accusing me of spiriting Bilbo away, or worse. If you want to know, there is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">supposed to be a plot between you and me to get hold of his wealth.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Some people!' exclaimed Frodo. 'You mean Otho and Lobelia. How<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">abominable! I would give them Bag End and everything else, if I could get<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bilbo back and go off tramping in the country with him. I love the Shire.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But I begin to wish, somehow, that I had gone too. I wonder if I shall ever<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">see him again.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'So do I,' said Gandalf. 'And I wonder many other things. Good-bye now!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Take care of yourself! Lookout for me, especially at unlikely times !<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Good-bye!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo saw him to the door. He gave a final wave of his hand, and walked<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">off at a surprising pace; but Frodo thought the old wizard looked unusually<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">bent, almost as if he was carrying a great weight. The evening was closing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in, and his cloaked figure quickly vanished into the twilight. Frodo did not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">see him again for a long time.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The talk did not die down in nine or even ninety -nine days. The second<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">disappearance of Mr. Bilbo Baggins was discussed in Hobbiton, and indeed all<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">over the Shire, for a year and a day, and was remembered much longer than<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that. It became a fireside -story for young hobbits; and eventually Mad<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Baggins, who used to vanish with a bang and a flash and reappear with bags<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of jewels and gold, became a favourite character of legend and lived on long<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">after all the true events were forgotten.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But in the meantime, the general opinion in the neighbourhood was that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bilbo, who had always been rather cracked, had at last gone quite mad, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">had run off into the Blue. There he had undoubtedly fallen into a pool or a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">river and come to a tragic, but hardly an untimely, end. The blame was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mostly laid on Gandalf.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'If only that dratted wizard will leave young Frodo alone, perhaps<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he'll settle down and grow some hobbit-sense,' they said. And to all<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">appearance the wizard did leave Frodo alone, and he did settle down, but the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">growth of hobbit-sense was not very noticeable. Indeed, he at once began to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">carry on Bilbo's reputation for oddity. He refused to go into mourning; and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the next year he gave a party in honour of Bilbo's hundred-and-twelfth<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">birthday, which he called Hundred-weight Feast. But that was short of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mark, for twenty guests were invited and there were several meals at which<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it snowed food and rained drink, as hobbits say.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Some people were rather shocked; but Frodo kept up the custom of giving<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bilbo's Birthday Party year after year until they got used to it. He said<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that he did not think Bilbo was dead. When they asked: 'Where is he then?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he shrugged his shoulders.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He lived alone, as Bilbo had done; but he had a good many friends,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Folco Boffin and Fredegar Bolger were two of these; but his closest friends<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were Peregrin Took (usually called Pippin), and Merry Brandybuck (his real<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">name was Meriadoc, but that was seldom remembered). Frodo went tramping<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>

</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the hills and woods under the starlight. Merry and Pippin suspected that he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">visited the Elves at times, as Bilbo had done.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As time went on, people began to notice that Frodo also showed signs of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">good â€™preservation': outwardly he retained the appearance of a robust and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">energetic hobbit just out of his tweens. â€™Some folk have all the luck,â€™ they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">said; but it was not until Frodo approached the usually more sober age of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fifty that they began to think it queer.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo himself, after the first shock, found that being his own master<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and the Mr. Baggins of Bag End was rather pleasant. For some years he was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">quite happy and did not worry much about the future. But half unknown to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">himself the regret that he had not gone with Bilbo was steadily growing. He<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">found himself wondering at times, especially in the autumn, about the wild<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">lands, and strange visions of mountains that he had never seen came into his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dreams. He began to say to himself: 'Perhaps I shall cross the River myself<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">one day.' To which the other half of his mind always replied: 'Not yet.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">So it went on, until his forties were running out, and his fiftieth<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">birthday was drawing near: fifty was a number that he felt was somehow<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">significant (or ominous); it was at any rate at that age that adventure had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">suddenly befallen Bilbo. Frodo began to feel restless, and the old paths<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">seemed too well-trodden. He looked at maps, and wondered what lay beyond<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">their edges: maps made in the Shire showed mostly white spaces beyond its<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">borders. He took to wandering further afield and more often by himself; and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Merry and his other friends watched him anxiously. Often he was seen walking<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and talking with the strange wayfarers that began at this time to appear in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Shire.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There were rumours of strange things happening in the world outside;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and as Gandalf had not at that time appeared or sent any message for several<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">years, Frodo gathered all the news he could. Elves, who seldom walked in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Shire, could now be seen passing westward through the woods in the evening,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">passing and not returning; but they were leaving Middle-earth and were no<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">longer concerned with its troubles. There were, however, dwarves on the road<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in unusual numbers. The ancient East -West Road ran through the Shire to its<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">end at the Grey Havens, and dwarves had always used it on their way to their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mines in the Blue Mountains. They were the hobbits' chief source of news<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">from distant parts - if they wanted any: as a rule dwarves said little and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hobbits asked no more. But now Frodo often met strange dwarves of far<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">countries, seeking refuge in the West. They were troubled, and some spoke in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">whispers of the Enemy and of the Land of Mordor.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">That name the hobbits only knew in legends of the dark past, like a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shadow in the background of their memories; but it was ominous and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">disquieting. It seemed that the evil power in Mirkwood had been driven out<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">by the White Council only to reappear in greater strength in the old<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">strongholds of Mordor. The Dark Tower had been rebuilt, it was said. From<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">there the power was spreading far and wide, and away far east and south<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">there were wars and growing fear. Ores were multiplying again in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mountains. Trolls were abroad, no longer dull-witted, but cunning and armed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with dreadful weapons. And there were murmured hints of creatures more<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">terrible than all these, but they had no name.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Little of all this, of course, reached the ears of ordinary hobbits.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But even the deafest and most stay-at-home began to hear queer tales; and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">those whose business took them to the borders saw strange things. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">conversation in The Green Dragon at Bywater, one evening in the spring of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo's fiftieth year, showed that even in the comfortable heart of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Shire rumours had been heard, though most hobbits still laughed at them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sam Gamgee was sitting in one corner near the fire, and opposite him<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was Ted Sandyman, the miller's son; and there were various other rustic<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hobbits listening to their talk.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™Queer things you do hear these days, to be sure,' said Sam.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Ah,' said Ted, 'you do, if you listen. But I can hear fireside-tales<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and children's stories at home, if I want to.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'No doubt you can,' retorted Sam, 'and I daresay there's more truth in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">some of them than you reckon. Who invented the stories anyway? Take<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dragons<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">now.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'No thank 'ee,' said Ted, 'I won't. I heard tell of them when I was a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">youngster, but there's no call to believe in them now. There's only one<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Dragon in By water, and that's Green,' he said, getting a general laugh.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'All right,' said Sam, laughing with the rest. 'But what about these<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Tree-men, these giants, as you might call them? They do say that one bigger<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">than a tree was seen up away beyond the North Moors not long back.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Who's theyT<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'My cousin Hal for one. He works for Mr. Boffin at Overhill and goes up<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to the Northfarthing for the hunting. He saw one.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Says he did, perhaps. Your Hal's always saying he's seen things; and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">maybe he sees things that ain't there.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'But this one was as big as an elm tree, and walking - walking seven<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">yards to a stride, if it was an inch.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Then I bet it wasn't an inch. What he saw was an elm tree, as like as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">not.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'But this one was walking, I tell you; and there ain't no elm tree on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the North Moors.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Then Hal can't have seen one,' said Ted. There was some laughing and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">clapping: the audience seemed to think that Ted had scored a point.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'All the same,' said Sam, 'you can't deny that others besides our<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Halfast have seen queer folk crossing the Shire - crossing it, mind you:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">there are more that are turned back at the borders. The Bounders have never<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">been so busy before.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'And I've heard tell that Elves are moving west. They do say they are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">going to the harbours, out away beyond the White Towers.' Sam waved his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">arm<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">vaguely: neither he nor any of them knew how far it was to the Sea, past the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">old towers beyond the western borders of the Shire. But it was an old<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">tradition that away over there stood the Grey Havens, from which at times<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">elven-ships set sail, never to return.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'They are sailing, sailing, sailing over the Sea, they are going into<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the West and leaving us,' said Sam, half chanting the words, shaking his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">head sadly and solemnly. But Ted laughed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well, that isn't anything new, if you believe the old tales. And I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">don't see what it matters to me or you. Let them sail! But I warrant you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">haven't seen them doing it; nor any one else in the Shire.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well I don't know,' said Sam thoughtfully. He believed he had once<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">seen an Elf in the woods, and still hoped to see more one day. Of all the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">legends that he had heard in his early years such fragments of tales and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">half-remembered stories about the Elves as the hobbits knew, had always<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">moved him most deeply. 'There are some, even in these parts, as know the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Fair Folk and get news of them,' he said. 'There's Mr. Baggins now, that I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">work for. He told me that they were sailing and he knows a bit about Elves.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And old Mr. Bilbo knew more: many's the talk I had with him when I was a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">little lad.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Oh, they're both cracked,' said Ted. 'Leastways old Bilbo was cracked,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and Frodo's cracking. If that's where you get your news from, you'll never<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">want for moonshine. Well, friends, I'm off home. Your good health!' He<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">drained his mug and went out noisily.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sam sat silent and said no more. He had a good deal to think about. For<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">one thing, there was a lot to do up in the Bag End garden, and he would have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a busy day tomorrow, if the weather cleared. The grass was growing fast. But<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sam had more on his mind than gardening. After a while he sighed, and got up<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and went out.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It was early April and the sky was now clearing after heavy rain. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sun was down, and a cool pale evening was quietly fading into night. He<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">walked home under the early stars through Hobbiton and up the Hill,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">whistling softly and thoughtfully.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It was just at this time that Gandalf reappeared after his long<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">absence. For three years after the Party he had been away. Then he paid<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo a brief visit, and after taking a good look at him he went off again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">During the next year or two he had turned up fairly often, coming<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">unexpectedly after dusk, and going off without warning before sunrise. He<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">would not discuss his own business and journeys, and seemed chiefly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">interested in small news about Frodo's health and doings.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Then suddenly his visits had ceased. It was over nine years since Frodo<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">had seen or heard of him, and he had begun to think that the wizard would<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">never return and had given up all interest in hobbits. But that evening, as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sam was walking home and twilight was fading, there came the once familiar<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">tap on the study window.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo welcomed his old friend with surprise and great delight. They<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">looked hard at one another.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™Ah well eh?' said Gandalf. 'You look the same as ever, Frodo!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'So do you,' Frodo replied; but secretly he thought that Gandalf looked<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">older and more careworn. He pressed him for news of himself and of the wide<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">world, and soon they were deep in talk, and they stayed up far into the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">night.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Next morning after a late breakfast, the wizard was sitting with Frodo<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">by the open window of the study. A bright fire was on the hearth, but the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sun was warm, and the wind was in the South. Everything looked fresh, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the new green of Spring was shimmering in the fields and on the tips of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">trees' fingers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gandalf was thinking of a spring, nearly eighty years before, when<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bilbo had run out of Bag End without a handkerchief. His hair was perhaps<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">whiter than it had been then, and his beard and eyebrows were perhaps<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">longer, and his face more lined with care and wisdom; but his eyes were as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">bright as ever, and he smoked and blew smoke -rings with the same vigour and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">delight.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He was smoking now in silence, for Frodo was sitting still, deep in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">thought. Even in the light of morning he felt the dark shadow of the tidings<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that Gandalf had brought. At last he broke the silence.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Last night you began to tell me strange things about my ring,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gandalf,' he said. 'And then you stopped, because you said that such matters<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were best left until daylight. Don't you think you had better finish now?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">You say the ring is dangerous, far more dangerous than I guess. In what<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">way?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'In many ways,' answered the wizard. It is far more powerful than I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ever dared to think at first, so powerful that in the end it would utterly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">overcome anyone of mortal race who possessed it. It would possess him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'In Eregion long ago many Elven-rings were made, magic rings as you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">call them, and they were, of course, of various kinds: some more potent and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">some less. The lesser rings were only essays in the craft before it was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">full-grown, and to the Elven-smiths they were but trifles - yet still to my<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mind dangerous for mortals. But the Great Rings, the Rings of Power, they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were perilous.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'A mortal, Frodo, who keeps one of the Great Rings, does not die, but<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he does not grow or obtain more life, he merely continues, until at last<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">every minute is a weariness. And if he often uses the Ring to make himself<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">invisible, he fades: he becomes in the end invisible permanently, and walks<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in the twilight under the eye of the dark power that rules the Rings. Yes,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sooner or later - later, if he is strong or well-meaning to begin with, but<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">neither strength nor good purpose will last - sooner or later the dark power<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">will devour him.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'How terrifying!' said Frodo. There was another long silence. The sound<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of Sam Gamgee cutting the lawn came in from the garden.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'How long have you known this?' asked Frodo at length. 'And how much<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">did Bilbo know?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Bilbo knew no more than he told you, I am sure,' said Gandalf. 'He<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">would certainly never have passed on to you anything that he thought would<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">be a danger, even though I promised to look after you. He thought the ring<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was very beautiful, and very useful at need; and if anything was wrong or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">queer, it was himself. He said that it was "growing on his mind", and he was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">always worrying about it; but he did not suspect that the ring itself was to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">blame. Though he had found out that the thing needed looking after; it did<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">not seem always of the same size or weight; it shrank or expanded in an odd<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">way, and might suddenly slip off a finger where it had been tight.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Yes, he warned me of that in his last letter,' said Frodo, 'so I have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">always kept it on its chain.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Very wise,' said Gandalf. 'But as for his long life, Bilbo never<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">connected it with the ring at all. He took all the credit for that to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">himself, and he was very proud of it. Though he was getting restless and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">uneasy. Thin and stretched he said. A sign that the ring was getting<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">control.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'How long have you known all this?' asked Frodo again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Known?' said Gandalf. 'I have known much that only the Wise know,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo. But if you mean "known about this ring", well, I still do not know,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">one might say. There is a last test to make. But I no longer doubt my guess.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'When did I first begin to guess?' he mused, searching back in memory.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Let me see - it was in the year that the White Council drove the dark power<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">from Mirkwood, just before the Battle of Five Armies, that Bilbo found his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ring. A shadow fell on my heart then, though I did not know yet what I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">feared. I wondered often how Gollum came by a Great Ring, as plainly it was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">- that at least was clear from the first. Then I heard Bilbo's strange story<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of how he had "won" it, and I could not believe it. When I at last got the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">truth out of him, I saw at once that he had been trying to put his claim to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the ring beyond doubt. Much like Gollum with his "birthday present". The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">lies were too much alike for my comfort. Clearly the ring had an unwholesome<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">power that set to work on its keeper at once. That was the first real<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">warning I had that all was not well. I told Bilbo often that such rings were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">better left unused; but he resented it, and soon got angry. There was little<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">else that I could do. I could not take it from him without doing greater<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">harm; and I had no right to do so anyway. I could only watch and wait. I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">might perhaps have consulted Saruman the White, but something always held<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">me<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">back.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Who is he?' asked Frodo. I have never heard of him before.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Maybe not,' answered Gandalf. 'Hobbits are, or were, no concern of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his. Yet he is great among the Wise. He is the chief of my order and the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">head of the Council. His knowledge is deep, but his pride has grown with it,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and he takes ill any meddling. The lore of the Elven-rings, great and small,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">is his province. He has long studied it, seeking the lost secrets of their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">making; but when the Rings were debated in the Council, all that he would<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">reveal to us of his ring-lore told against my fears. So my doubt slept - but<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">uneasily. Still I watched and I waited.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'And all seemed well with Bilbo. And the years passed. Yes, they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">passed, and they seemed not to touch him. He showed no signs of age. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shadow fell on me again. But I said to myself: "After all he comes of a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">long-lived family on his mother's side. There is time yet. Wait!"<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'And I waited. Until that night when he left this house. He said and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">did things then that filled me with a fear that no words of Saruman could<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">allay. I knew at last that something dark and deadly was at work. And I have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">spent most of the years since then in finding out the truth of it.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'There wasn't any permanent harm done, was there?' asked Frodo<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">anxiously. 'He would get all right in time, wouldn't he? Be able to rest in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">peace, I mean?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'He felt better at once,' said Gandalf. 'But there is only one Power in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">this world that knows all about the Rings and their effects; and as far as I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">know there is no Power in the world that knows all about hobbits. Among the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Wise I am the only one that goes in for hobbit-lore: an obscure branch of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">knowledge, but full of surprises. Soft as butter they can be, and yet<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sometimes as tough as old tree-roots. I think it likely that some would<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">resist the Rings far longer than most of the Wise would believe. I don't<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">think you need worry about Bilbo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Of course, he possessed the ring for many years, and used it, so it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">might take a long while for the influence to wear off - before it was safe<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">for him to see it again, for instance. Otherwise, he might live on for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">years, quite happily: just stop as he was when he parted with it. For he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">gave it up in the end of his own accord: an important point. No, I was not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">troubled about dear Bilbo any more, once he had let the thing go. It is for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you that I feel responsible.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Ever since Bilbo left I have been deeply concerned about you, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">about all these charming, absurd, helpless hobbits. It would be a grievous<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">blow to the world, if the Dark Power overcame the Shire; if all your kind,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">jolly, stupid Bolgers, Hornblowers, Boffins, Bracegirdles, and the rest, not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to mention the ridiculous Bagginses, became enslaved.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo shuddered. 'But why should we be?' he asked. 'And why should he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">want such slaves?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'To tell you the truth,' replied Gandalf, 'I believe that hitherto -<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hitherto, mark you - he has entirely overlooked the existence of hobbits.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">You should be thankful. But your safety has passed. He does not need you -<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he has many more useful servants - but he won't forget you again. And<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hobbits as miserable slaves would please him far more than hobbits happy and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">free. There is such a thing as malice and revenge.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Revenge?' said Frodo. 'Revenge for what? I still don't understand what<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">all this has to do with Bilbo and myself, and our ring.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'It has everything to do with it,' said Gandalf. 'You do not know the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">real peril yet; but you shall. I was not sure of it myself when I was last<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">here; but the time has come to speak. Give me the ring for a moment.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo took it from his breeches-pocket, where it was clasped to a chain<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that hung from his belt. He unfastened it and handed it slowly to the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wizard. It felt suddenly very heavy, as if either it or Frodo himself was in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">some way reluctant for Gandalf to touch it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gandalf held it up. It looked to be made of pure and solid gold. 'Can<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you see any markings on it?' he asked.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'No,' said Frodo. 'There are none. It is quite plain, and it never<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shows a scratch or sign of wear.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well then, look!' To Frodo's astonishment and distress the wizard<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">threw it suddenly into the middle of a glowing corner of the fire. Frodo<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">gave a cry and groped for the tongs; but Gandalf held him back.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Wait!' he said in a commanding voice, giving Frodo a quick look from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">under his bristling brows.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">No apparent change came over the ring. After a while Gandalf got up,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">closed the shutters outside the window, and drew the curtains. The room<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">became dark and silent, though the clack of Sam's shears, now nearer to the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">windows, could still be heard faintly from the garden. For a moment the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wizard stood looking at the fire; then he stooped and removed the ring to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the hearth with the tongs, and at once picked it up. Frodo gasped.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It is quite cool,' said Gandalf. 'Take it!' Frodo received it on his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shrinking palm: it seemed to have become thicker and heavier than ever.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Hold it up!' said Gandalf. 'And look closely!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As Frodo did so, he now saw fine lines, finer than the finest<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">pen-strokes, running along the ring, outside and inside: lines of fire that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">seemed to form the letters of a flowing script. They shone piercingly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">bright, and yet remote, as if out of a great depth.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I cannot read the fiery letters,' said Frodo in a quavering voice.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'No,' said Gandalf, 'but I can. The letters are Elvish, of an ancient<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mode, but the language is that of Mordor, which I will not utter here. But<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">this in the Common Tongue is what is said, close enough:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It is only two lines of a verse long known in Elven-lore:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">One Ring to rule them all. One Ring to find them,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie. '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He paused, and then said slowly in a deep voice: 'This is the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Master -ring, the One Ring to rule them all. This is the One Ring that he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">lost many ages ago, to the great weakening of his power. He greatly desires<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it - but he must not get it.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo sat silent and motionless. Fear seemed to stretch out a vast<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hand, like a dark cloud rising in the East and looming up to engulf him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'This ring!' he stammered. 'How, how on earth did it come to me?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Ah!' said Gandalf. 'That is a very long story. The beginnings lie back<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in the Black Years, which only the lore-masters now remember. If I were to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">tell you all that tale, we should still be sitting here when Spring had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">passed into Winter.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'But last night I told you of Sauron the Great, the Dark Lord. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">rumours that you have heard are true: he has indeed arisen again and left<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his hold in Mirkwood and returned to his ancient fastness in the Dark Tower<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of Mordor. That name even you hobbits have heard of, like a shadow on the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">borders of old stories. Always after a defeat and a respite, the Shadow<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">takes another shape and grows again.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I wish it need not have happened in my time,' said Frodo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'So do I,' said Gandalf, 'and so do all who live to see such times. But<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">time that is given, us. And already, Frodo, our time is beginning to look<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">black. The Enemy is fast becoming very strong. His plans are far from ripe,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I think, but they are ripening. We shall be hard put to it. We should be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">very hard put to it, even if it were not for this dreadful chance.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'The Enemy still lacks one thing to give him strength and knowledge to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">beat down all resistance, break the last defences, and cover all the lands<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in a second darkness. He lacks the One Ring.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'The Three, fairest of all, the Elf-lords hid from him, and his hand<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">never touched them or sullied them. Seven the Dwarf-kings possessed, but<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">three he has recovered, and the others the dragons have consumed. Nine he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">gave to Mortal Men, proud and great, and so ensnared them. Long ago they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fell under the dominion of the One, and they became Ringwraiths, shadows<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">under his great Shadow, his most terrible servants. Long ago. It is many a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">year since the Nine walked abroad. Yet who knows? As the Shadow grows<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">once<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">more, they too may walk again. But come! We will not speak of such things<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">even in the morning of the Shire.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'So it is now: the Nine he has gathered to himself; the Seven also, or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">else they are destroyed. The Three are hidden still. But that no longer<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">troubles him. He only needs the One; for he made that Ring himself, it is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his, and he let a great part of his own former power pass into it, so that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he could rule all the others. If he recovers it, then he will command them<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">all again, wherever they be, even the Three, and all that has been wrought<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with them will be laid bare, and he will be stronger than ever.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'And this is the dreadful chance, Frodo. He believed that the One had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">perished; that the Elves had destroyed it, as should have been done. But he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">knows now that it has not perished, that it has been found. So he is seeking<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it, seeking it, and all his thought is bent on it. It is his great hope and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">our great fear.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Why, why wasn't it destroyed?' cried Frodo. 'And how did the Enemy<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ever come to lose it, if he was so strong, and it was so precious to him?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He clutched the Ring in his hand, as if he saw already dark fingers<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stretching out to seize it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'It was taken from him,' said Gandalf. 'The strength of the Elves to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">resist him was greater long ago; and not all Men were estranged from them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Men of Westernesse came to their aid. That is a chapter of ancient<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">history which it might be good to recall; for there was sorrow then too, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">gathering dark, but great valour, and great deeds that were not wholly vain.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">One day, perhaps, I will tell you all the tale, or you shall hear it told in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">full by one who knows it best.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'But for the moment, since most of all you need to know how this thing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">came to you, and that will be tale enough, this is all that I will say. It<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was Gil-galad, Elven-king and Elendil of Westernesse who overthrew Sauron,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">though they themselves perished in the deed; and Isildur Elendil's son cut<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Ring from Sauron's hand and took it for his own. Then Sauron was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">vanquished and his spirit fled and was hidden for long years, until his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shadow took shape again in Mirkwood.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'But the Ring was lost. It fell into the Great River, Anduin, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">vanished. For Isildur was marching north along the east banks of the River,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and near the Gladden Fields he was waylaid by the Ores of the Mountains, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">almost all his folk were slain. He leaped into the waters, but the Ring<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">slipped from his finger as he swam, and then the Ores saw him and killed him<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with arrows.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gandalf paused. 'And there in the dark pools amid the Gladden Fields,'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he said, 'the Ring passed out of knowledge and legend; and even so much of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">its history is known now only to a few, and the Council of the Wise could<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">discover no more. But at last I can carry on the story, I think.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Fong after, but still very long ago, there lived by the banks of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Great River on the edge of Wilderland a clever -handed and quiet-footed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">little people. I guess they were of hobbit -kind; akin to the fathers of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fathers of the Stoors, for they loved the River, and often swam in it, or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">made little boats of reeds. There was among them a family of high repute,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">for it was large and wealthier than most, and it was ruled by a grandmother<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of the folk, stern and wise in old lore, such as they had. The most<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">inquisitive and curious-minded of that family was called Smjagol. He was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">interested in roots and beginnings; he dived into deep pools; he burrowed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">under trees and growing plants; he tunnelled into green mounds; and he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ceased to look up at the hill-tops, or the leaves on trees, or the flowers<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">opening in the air: his head and his eyes were downward.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'He had a friend called Djagol, of similar sort, sharper -eyed but not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">so quick and strong. On a time they took a boat and went down to the Gladden<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Fields, where there were great beds of iris and flowering reeds. There<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Smjagol got out and went nosing about the banks but Deal sat in the boat and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fished. Suddenly a great fish took his hook, and before he knew where he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was, he was dragged out and down into the water, to the bottom. Then he let<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">go of his line, for he thought he saw something shining in the river-bed;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and holding his breath he grabbed at it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Then up he came spluttering, with weeds in his hair and a handful of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mud; and he swam to the bank. And behold! when he washed the mud away,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">there<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in his hand lay a beautiful golden ring; and it shone and glittered in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sun, so that his heart was glad. But Smjagol had been watching him from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">behind a tree, and as Deal gloated over the ring, Smjagol came softly up<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">behind.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">"'Give us that, Deal, my love," said Smjagol, over his friend's<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shoulder.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'"Why?" said Deal.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">' "Because it's my birthday, my love, and I wants it," said Smjagol.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'"I don't care," said Deal. "I have given you a present already, more<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">than I could afford. I found this, and I'm going to keep it."<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">' "Oh, are you indeed, my love," said Smjagol; and he caught Deal by<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the throat and strangled him, because the gold looked so bright and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">beautiful. Then he put the ring on his finger.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'No one ever found out what had become of Deal; he was murdered far<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">from home, and his body was cunningly hidden. But Smjagol returned alone;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and he found that none of his family could see him, when he was wearing the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ring. He was very pleased with his discovery and he concealed it; and he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">used it to find out secrets, and he put his knowledge to crooked and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">malicious uses. He became sharp-eyed and keen-eared for all that was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hurtful. The ring had given him power according to his stature. It is not to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">be wondered at that he became very unpopular and was shunned (when<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">visible)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">by all his relations. They kicked him, and he bit their feet. He took to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">thieving, and going about muttering to himself, and gurgling in his throat.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">So they called him Gollum, and cursed him, and told him to go far away; and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his grandmother, desiring peace, expelled him from the family and turned him<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">out of her hole.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'He wandered in loneliness, weeping a little for the hardness of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">world, and he journeyed up the River, till he came to a stream that flowed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">down from the mountains, and he went that way. He caught fish in deep pools<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with invisible fingers and ate them raw. One day it was very hot, and as he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was bending over a pool, he felt a burning on the back of his head) and a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dazzling light from the water pained his wet eyes. He wondered at it, for he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">had almost forgotten about the Sun. Then for the last time he looked up and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shook his fist at her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'But as he lowered his eyes, he saw far above the tops of the Misty<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mountains, out of which the stream came. And he thought suddenly: "It would<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">be cool and shady under those mountains. The Sun could not watch me there.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The roots of those mountains must be roots indeed; there must be great<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">secrets buried there which have not been discovered since the beginning."<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™So he journeyed by night up into the highlands, and he found a little<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">cave out of which the dark stream ran; and he wormed his way like a maggot<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">into the heart of the hills, and vanished out of all knowledge. The Ring<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">went into the shadows with him, and even the maker, when his power had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">begun<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to grow again, could learn nothing of it.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Gollum!' cried Frodo. 'Gollum? Do you mean that this is the very<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gollum-creature that Bilbo met? How loathsome!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I think it is a sad story,' said the wizard, 'and it might have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">happened to others, even to some hobbits that I have known.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I can't believe that Gollum was connected with hobbits, however<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">distantly,' said Frodo with some heat. 'What an abominable notion!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'It is true all the same,' replied Gandalf. 'About their origins, at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">any rate, I know more than hobbits do themselves. And even Bilbo's story<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">suggests the kinship. There was a great deal in the background of their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">minds and memories that was very similar. They understood one another<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">remarkably well, very much better than a hobbit would understand, say, a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Dwarf, or an Ore, or even an Elf. Think of the riddles they both knew, for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">one thing.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Yes,' said Frodo. 'Though other folks besides hobbits ask riddles, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of much the same sort. And hobbits don't cheat. Gollum meant to cheat all<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the time. He was just trying to put poor Bilbo off his guard. And I daresay<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it amused his wickedness to start a game which might end in providing him<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with an easy victim, but if he lost would not hurt him.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Only too true, I fear,' said Gandalf. 'But there was something else in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it, I think, which you don't see yet. Even Gollum was not wholly ruined. He<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">had proved tougher than even one of the Wise would have guessed -as a hobbit<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">light came through it, as through a chink in the dark: light out of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">past. It was actually pleasant, I think, to hear a kindly voice again,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">bringing up memories of wind, and trees, and sun on the grass, and such<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">forgotten things.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the end - unless it could be conquered. Unless it could be cured.' Gandalf<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sighed. 'Alas! there is little hope of that for him. Yet not no hope. No,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">not though he possessed the Ring so long, almost as far back as he can<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">remember. For it was long since he had worn it much: in the black darkness<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it was seldom needed. Certainly he had never "faded". He is thin and tough<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">still. But the thing was eating up his mind, of course, and the torment had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">become almost unbearable.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'All the "great secrets" under the mountains had turned out to be just<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">empty night: there was nothing more to find out, nothing worth doing, only<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">nasty furtive eating and resentful remembering. He was altogether wretched.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He hated the dark, and he hated light more: he hated everything, and the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'What do you mean?' said Frodo. 'Surely the Ring was his precious and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the only thing he cared for? But if he hated it, why didn't he get rid of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it, or go away and leave it?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You ought to begin to understand, Frodo, after all you have heard,'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">said Gandalf. 'He hated it and loved it, as he hated and loved himself. He<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">could not get rid of it. He had no will left in the matter.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'A Ring of Power looks after itself, Frodo. It may slip off<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">treacherously, but its keeper never abandons it. At most he plays with the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">idea of handing it on to someone else's care - and that only at an early<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stage, when it first begins to grip. But as far as I know Bilbo alone in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">history has ever gone beyond playing, and really done it. He needed all my<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">help, too. And even so he would never have just forsaken it, or cast it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">aside. It was not Gollum, Frodo, but the Ring itself that decided things.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Ring left him. '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'What, just in time to meet Bilbo?' said Frodo. 'Wouldn't an Ore have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">suited it better?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'It is no laughing matter,' said Gandalf. 'Not for you. It was the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">strangest event in the whole history of the Ring so far: Bilbo's arrival<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">just at that time, and putting his hand on it, blindly, in the dark.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'There was more than one power at work, Frodo. The Ring was trying to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">get back to its master. It had slipped from Isildur's hand and betrayed him;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">then when a chance came it caught poor Deal, and he was murdered; and after<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that Gollum, and it had devoured him. It could make no further use of him:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he was too small and mean; and as long as it stayed with him he would never<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">leave his deep pool again. So now, when its master was awake once more and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sending out his dark thought from Mirkwood, it abandoned Gollum. Only to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">picked up by the most unlikely person imaginable: Bilbo from the Shire!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Behind that there was something else at work, beyond any design of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Ring-maker. I can put it no plainer than by saying that Bilbo was meant to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">find the Ring, and not by its maker. In which case you also were meant to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">have it. And that maybe an encouraging thought.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It is not,' said Frodo. "Though I am not sure that I understand you.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But how have you learned all this about the Ring, and about Gollum? Do you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">really know it all, or are you just guessing still?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gandalf looked at Frodo, and his eyes glinted. I knew much and I have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">learned much,' he answered. 'But I am not going to give an account of all my<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">doings to you. The history of Elendil and Isildur and the One Ring is known<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to all the Wise. Your ring is shown to be that One Ring by the fire- writing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">alone, apart from any other evidence.' 'And when did you discover that?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">asked Frodo, interrupting. 'Just now in this room, of course,' answered the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wizard sharply. 'But I expected to find it. I have come back from dark<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">journeys and long search to make that final test. It is the last proof, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">all is now only too clear. Making out Gollum's part, and fitting it into the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">gap in the history, required some thought. I may have started with guesses<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">about Gollum, but I am not guessing now. I know. I have seen him.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You have seen Gollum?' exclaimed Frodo in amazement.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Yes. The obvious thing to do, of course, if one could. I tried long<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ago; but I have managed it at last.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Then what happened after Bilbo escaped from him? Do you know that?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Not so clearly. What I have told you is what Gollum was willing to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">tell - though not, of course, in the way I have reported it. Gollum is a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">liar, and you have to sift his words. For instance, he called the Ring his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">"birthday present", and he stuck to that. He said it came from his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">grandmother, who had lots of beautiful things of that kind. A ridiculous<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">story. I have no doubt that Smjagol's grandmother was a matriarch, a great<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">person in her way, but to talk of her possessing many Elven-rings was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">absurd, and as for giving them away, it was a lie. But a lie with a grain of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">truth.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'The murder of Deal haunted Gollum, and he had made up a defence,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">repeating it to his "precious" over and over again, as he gnawed bones in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the dark, until he almost believed it. It was his birthday. Deal ought to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">have given the ring to him. It had previously turned up just so as to be a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">present. It was his birthday present, and so on, and on.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I endured him as long as I could, but the truth was desperately<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">important, and in the end I had to be harsh. I put the fear of fire on him,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and wrung the true story out of him, bit by bit, together with much<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">snivelling and snarling. He thought he was misunderstood and ill-used. But<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Riddle-game and Bilbo's escape, he would not say any more, except in dark<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hints. Some other fear was on him greater than mine. He muttered that he was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">going to gel his own back. People would see if he would stand being kicked,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and driven into a hole and then robbed. Gollum had good friends now, good<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">friends and very strong. They would help him. Baggins would pay for it. That<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was his chief thought. He hated Bilbo and cursed his name. What is more, he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">knew where he came from.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'But how did he find that out?' asked Frodo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well, as for the name, Bilbo very foolishly told Gollum himself; and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">after that it would not be difficult to discover his country, once Gollum<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">came out. Oh yes, he came out. His longing for the Ring proved stronger than<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his fear of the Ores, or even of the light. After a year or two he left the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mountains. You see, though still bound by desire of it, the Ring was no<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">longer devouring him; he began to revive a little. He felt old, terribly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">old, yet less timid, and he was mortally hungry.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Light, light of Sun and Moon, he still feared and hated, and he always<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">will, I think; but he was cunning. He found he could hide from daylight and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">moonshine, and make his way swiftly and softly by dead of night with his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">pale cold eyes, and catch small frightened or unwary things. He grew<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stronger and bolder with new food and new air. He found his way into<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mirkwood, as one would expect.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Is that where you found him?' asked Frodo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I saw him there,' answered Gandalf, 'but before that he had wandered<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">far, following Bilbo's trail. It was difficult to learn anything from him<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">for certain, for his talk was constantly interrupted by curses and threats.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">"What had it got in its pocketses?" he said. "It wouldn't say, no precious.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Little cheat. Not a fair question. It cheated first, it did. It broke the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">rules. We ought to have squeezed it, yes precious. And we will, precious!"<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™That is a sample of his talk. I don't suppose you want any more. I had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">weary days of it. But from hints dropped among the snarls I even gathered<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that his padding feet had taken him at last to Esgaroth, and even to the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">streets of Dale, listening secretly and peering. Well, the news of the great<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">events went far and wide in Wilderland, and many had heard Bilbo's name and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">knew where he came from. We had made no secret of our return journey to his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">home in the West. Gollum's sharp ears would soon learn what he wanted.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Then why didn't he track Bilbo further?' asked Frodo. 'Why didn't he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">come to the Shire?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Ah,' said Gandalf, 'now we come to it. I think Gollum tried to. He set<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">out and came back westward, as far as the Great River. But then he turned<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">aside. He was not daunted by the distance, I am sure. No, something else<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">drew him away. So my friends think, those that hunted him for me.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'The Wood -elves tracked him first, an easy task for them, for his trail<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was still fresh then. Through Mirkwood and back again it led them, though<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they never caught him. The wood was full of the rumour of him, dreadful<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">tales even among beasts and birds. The Woodmen said that there was some<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">new<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">terror abroad, a ghost that drank blood. It climbed trees to find nests; it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">crept into holes to find the young; it slipped through windows to find<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">cradles.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'But at the western edge of Mirkwood the trail turned away. It wandered<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">off southwards and passed out of the Wood-elves' ken, and was lost. And then<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I made a great mistake. Yes, Frodo, and not the first; though I fear it may<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">prove the worst. I let the matter be. I let him go; for I had much else to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">think of at that time, and I still trusted the lore of Saruman.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well, that was years ago. I have paid for it since with many dark and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dangerous days. The trail was long cold when I took it up again, after Bilbo<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">left here. And my search would have been in vain, but for the help that I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">had from a friend: Aragorn, the greatest traveller and huntsman of this age<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of the world. Together we sought for Gollum down the whole length of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Wilderland, without hope, and without success. But at last, when I had given<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">up the chase and turned to other parts, Gollum was found. My friend returned<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">out of the great perils bringing the miserable creature with him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™What he had been doing he would not say. He only wept and called us<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">cruel, with many a gollum in his throat; and when we pressed him he whined<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and cringed, and rubbed his long hands, licking his fingers as if they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">pained him, as if he remembered some old torture. But I am afraid there is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">no possible doubt: he had made his slow, sneaking way, step by step, mile by<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mile, south, down at last to the Land of Mordor.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A heavy silence fell in the room. Frodo could hear his heart beating.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Even outside everything seemed still. No sound of Sam's shears could now be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">heard.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™Yes, to Mordor,' said Gandalf. 'Alas! Mordor draws all wicked things,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and the Dark Power was bending all its will to gather them there. The Ring<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of the Enemy would leave its mark, too, leave him open to the summons. And<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">all folk were whispering then of the new Shadow in the South, and its hatred<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of the West. There were his fine new friends, who would help him in his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">revenge !<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Wretched fool! In that land he would learn much, too much for his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">comfort. And sooner or later as he lurked and pried on the borders he would<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">be caught, and taken - for examination. That was the way of it, I fear. When<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he was found he had already been there long, and was on his way back. On<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">some errand of mischief. But that does not matter much now. His worst<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mischief was done.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Yes, alas! through him the Enemy has learned that the One has been<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">found again. He knows where Isildur fell. He knows where Gollum found his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ring. He knows that it is a Great Ring, for it gave long life. He knows that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it is not one of the Three, for they have never been lost, and they endure<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">no evil. He knows that it is not one of the Seven, or the Nine, for they are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">accounted for. He knows that it is the One. And he has at last heard, I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">think, of hobbits and the Shire.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'The Shire - he may be seeking for it now, if he has not already found<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">out where it lies. Indeed, Frodo, I fear that he may even think that the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">long -unnoticed name of Baggins has become important.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'But this is terrible!' cried Frodo. 'Far worse than the worst that I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">imagined from your hints and warnings. O Gandalf, best of friends, what am I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to do? For now I am really afraid. What am I to do? What a pity that Bilbo<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">did not stab that vile creature, when he had a chance!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Pity? It was Pity that stayed his hand. Pity, and Mercy: not to strike<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">without need. And he has been well rewarded, Frodo. Be sure that he took so<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">little hurt from the evil, and escaped in the end, because he began his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ownership of the Ring so. With Pity.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I am sorry,' said Frodo. 'But I am frightened; and I do not feel any<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">pity for Gollum.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You have not seen him,' Gandalf broke in.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'No, and I don't want to,' said Frodo. I can't understand you. Do you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mean to say that you, and the Elves, have let him live on after all those<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">horrible deeds? Now at any rate he is as bad as an Ore, and just an enemy.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He deserves death.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Deserves it! I daresay he does. Many that live deserve death. And some<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that die deserve life. Can you give it to them? Then do not be too eager to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">deal out death in judgement. For even the very wise cannot see all ends. I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">have not much hope that Gollum can be cured before he dies, but there is a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">chance of it. And he is bound up with the fate of the Ring. My heart tells<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">me that he has some part to play yet, for good or ill, before the end; and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">when that comes, the pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many - yours not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">least. In any case we did not kill him: he is very old and very wretched.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Wood-elves have him in prison, but they treat him with such kindness as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they can find in their wise hearts.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'All the same,' said Frodo, 'even if Bilbo could not kill Gollum, I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wish he had not kept the Ring. I wish he had never found it, and that I had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">not got it! Why did you let me keep it? Why didn't you make me throw it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">away, or, or destroy it?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Let you? Make you?' said the wizard. 'Haven't you been listening to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">all that I have said? You are not thinking of what you are saying. But as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">for throwing it away, that was obviously wrong. These Rings have a way of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">being found. In evil hands it might have done great evil. Worst of all, it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">might have fallen into the hands of the Enemy. Indeed it certainly would;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">for this is the One, and he is exerting all his power to find it or draw it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Of course, my dear Frodo, it was dangerous for you; and that has<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">troubled me deeply. But there was so much at stake that I had to take some<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">risk - though even when I was far away there has never been a day when the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Shire has not been guarded by watchful eyes. As long as you never used it, I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">did not think that the Ring would have any lasting effect on you, not for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">evil, not at any rate for a very long time. And you must remember that nine<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">years ago, when I last saw you, I still knew little for certain.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'But why not destroy it, as you say should have been done long ago?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">cried Frodo again. If you had warned me, or even sent me a message, I would<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">have done away with it.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Would you? How would you do that? Have you ever tried?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'No. But I suppose one could hammer it or melt it.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Try!' said Gandalf. Try now!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo drew the Ring out of his pocket again and looked at it. It now<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">appeared plain and smooth, without mark or device that he could see. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">gold looked very fair and pure, and Frodo thought how rich and beautiful was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">its colour, how perfect was its roundness. It was an admirable thing and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">altogether precious. When he took it out he had intended to fling it from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">him into the very hottest part of the fire. But he found now that he could<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">not do so, not without a great struggle. He weighed the Ring in his hand,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hesitating, and forcing himself to remember all that Gandalf had told him;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and then with an effort of will he made a movement, as if to cast it away -<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">but he found that he had put it back in his pocket.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gandalf laughed grimly. 'You see? Already you too, Frodo, cannot easily<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">let it go, nor will to damage it. And I could not "make" you - except by<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">force, which would break your mind. But as for breaking the Ring, force is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">useless. Even if you took it and struck it with a heavy sledge-hammer, it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">would make no dint in it. It cannot be unmade by your hands, or by mine.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Your small fire, of course, would not melt even ordinary gold. This<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Ring has already passed through it unscathed, and even unheated. But there<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">is no smith's forge in this Shire that could change it at all. Not even the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">anvils and furnaces of the Dwarves could do that. It has been said that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dragon-fire could melt and consume the Rings of Power, but there is not now<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">any dragon left on earth in which the old fire is hot enough; nor was there<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ever any dragon, not even Ancalagon the Black, who could have harmed the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">One<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Ring, the Ruling Ring, for that was made by Sauron himself. There is only<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">one way: to find the Cracks of Doom in the depths of Orodruin, the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Fire-mountain, and cast the Ring in there, if you really wish to destroy it,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to put it beyond the grasp of the Enemy for ever.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I do really wish to destroy it!' cried Frodo. 'Or, well, to have it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">destroyed. I am not made for perilous quests. I wish I had never seen the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Ring ! Why did it come to me? Why was I chosen?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™Such questions cannot be answered,' said Gandalf. 'You may be sure<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that it was not for any merit that others do not possess: not for power or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wisdom, at any rate. But you have been chosen, and you must therefore use<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">such strength and heart and wits as you have.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'But I have so little of any of these things! You are wise and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">powerful. Will you not take the Ring?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'No!' cried Gandalf, springing to his feet. 'With that power I should<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">have power too great and terrible. And over me the Ring would gain a power<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">still greater and more deadly.' His eyes flashed and his face was lit as by<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a fire within. 'Do not tempt me! For I do not wish to become like the Dark<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Lord himself. Yet the way of the Ring to my heart is by pity, pity for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">weakness and the desire of strength to do good. Do not tempt me! I dare not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">take it, not even to keep it safe, unused. The wish to wield it would be too<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">great, for my strength. I shall have such need of it. Great perils lie<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">before me.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He went to the window and drew aside the curtains and the shutters.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sunlight streamed back again into the room. Sam passed along the path<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">outside whistling. 'And now,' said the wizard, turning back to Frodo, 'the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">decision lies with you. But I will always help you.' He laid his hand on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo's shoulder. 'I will help you bear this burden, as long as It is yours<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to bear. But we must do something, soon. The Enemy is moving.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There was a long silence. Gandalf sat down again and puffed at his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">pipe, as if lost in thought. His eyes seemed closed, but under the lids he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was watching Frodo intently. Frodo gazed fixedly at the red embers on the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hearth, until they filled all his vision, and he seemed to be looking down<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">into profound wells of fire. He was thinking of the fabled Cracks of Doom<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and the terror of the Fiery Mountain.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well!' said Gandalf at last. 'What are you thinking about? Have you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">decided what to do?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'No!' answered Frodo, coming back to himself out of darkness, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">finding to his surprise that it was not dark, and that out of the window he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">could see the sunlit garden. 'Or perhaps, yes. As far as I understand what<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you have said, I suppose I must keep the Ring and guard it, at least for the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">present, whatever it may do to me.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Whatever it may do, it will be slow, slow to evil, if you keep it with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that purpose,' said Gandalf.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I hope so,' said Frodo. 'But I hope that you may find some other<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">better keeper soon. But in the meanwhile it seems that I am a danger, a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">danger to all that live near me. I cannot keep the Ring and stay here. I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ought to leave Bag End, leave the Shire, leave everything and go away.â€™ He<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sighed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I should like to save the Shire, if I could - though there have been<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">times when I thought the inhabitants too stupid and dull for words, and have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">felt that an earthquake or an invasion of dragons might be good for them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But I don't feel like that now. I feel that as long as the Shire lies<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">behind, safe and comfortable, I shall find wandering more bearable: I shall<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">know that somewhere there is a firm foothold, even if my feet cannot stand<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">there again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Of course, I have sometimes thought of going away, but I imagined that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">as a kind of holiday, a series of adventures like Bilbo's or better, ending<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in peace. But this would mean exile, a flight from danger into danger,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">drawing it after me. And I suppose I must go alone, if I am to do that and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">save the Shire. But I feel very small, and very uprooted, and well -<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">desperate. The Enemy is so strong and terrible.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He did not tell Gandalf, but as he was speaking a great desire to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">follow Bilbo flamed up in his heart - to follow Bilbo, and even perhaps to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">find him again. It was so strong that it overcame his fear: he could almost<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">have run out there and then down the road without his hat, as Bilbo had done<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">on a similar morning long ago.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'My dear Frodo!' exclaimed Gandalf. 'Hobbits really are amazing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">creatures, as I have said before. You can learn all that there is to know<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">about their ways in a month, and yet after a hundred years they can still<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">surprise you at a pinch. I hardly expected to get such an answer, not even<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">from you. But Bilbo made no mistake in choosing his heir, though he little<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">thought how important it would prove. I am afraid you are right. The Ring<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">will not be able to stay hidden in the Shire much longer; and for your own<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sake, as well as for others, you will have to go, and leave the name of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Baggins behind you. That name will not be safe to have, outside the Shire or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in the Wild. I will give you a travelling name now. When you go, go as Mr.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Underhill.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'But I don't think you need go alone. Not if you know of anyone you can<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">trust, and who would be willing to go by your side - and that you would be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">willing to take into unknown perils. But if you look for a companion, be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">careful in choosing! And be careful of what you say, even to your closest<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">friends! The enemy has many spies and many ways of hearing.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Suddenly he stopped as if listening. Frodo became aware that all was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">very quiet, inside and outside. Gandalf crept to one side of the window.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Then with a dart he sprang to the sill, and thrust a long arm out and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">downwards. There was a squawk, and up came Sam Gamgee's curly head<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hauled by<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">one ear.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well, well, bless my beard!' said Gandalf. 'Sam Gamgee is it? Now what<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">may you be doing?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Lor bless you, Mr. Gandalf, sir!' said Sam. 'Nothing! Leastways I was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">just trimming the grass-border under the window, if you follow me.' He<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">picked up his shears and exhibited them as evidence.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I don't,' said Gandalf grimly. It is some time since I last heard the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sound of your shears. How long have you been eavesdropping?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Eavesdropping, sir? I don't follow you, begging your pardon. There<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ain't no eaves at Bag End, and that's a fact.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Don't be a fool! What have you heard, and why did you listen?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gandalf s eyes flashed and his brows stuck out like bristles.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Mr. Frodo, sir!' cried Sam quaking. 'Don't let him hurt me, sir! Don't<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">let him turn me into anything unnatural! My old dad would take on so. I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">meant no harm, on my honour, sir!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'He won't hurt you,' said Frodo, hardly able to keep from laughing,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">although he was himself startled and rather puzzled. 'He knows, as well as I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">do, that you mean no harm. But just you up and answer his questions straight<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">away!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well, sir,' said Sam dithering a little. 'I heard a deal that I didn't<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">rightly understand, about an enemy, and rings, and Mr. Bilbo, sir, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dragons, and a fiery mountain, and - and Elves, sir. I listened because I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">couldn't help myself, if you know what I mean. Lor bless me, sir, but I do<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">love tales of that sort. And I believe them too, whatever Ted may say.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Elves, sir! I would dearly love to see them. Couldn't you take me to see<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Elves, sir, when you go?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Suddenly Gandalf laughed. 'Come inside!' he shouted, and putting out<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">both his arms he lifted the astonished Sam, shears, grass-clippings and all,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">right through the window and stood him on the floor. 'Take you to see Elves,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">eh?' he said, eyeing Sam closely, but with a smile flickering on his face.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'So you heard that Mr. Frodo is going away?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I did, sir. And that's why I choked: which you heard seemingly. I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">tried not to, sir, but it burst out of me: I was so upset.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'It can't be helped, Sam,' said Frodo sadly. He had suddenly realized<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that flying from the Shire would mean more painful partings than merely<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">saying farewell to the familiar comforts of Bag End. 'I shall have to go.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But' - and here he looked hard at Sam - 'if you really care about me, you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">will keep that dead secret. See? If you don't, if you even breathe a word of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">what you've heard here, then I hope Gandalf will turn you into a spotted<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sam fell on his knees, trembling. 'Get up, Sam!' said Gandalf. I have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">thought of something better than that. Something to shut your mouth, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">punish you properly for listening. You shall go away with Mr. Frodo!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Me, sir!' cried Sam, springing up like a dog invited for a walk. 'Me<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">go and see Elves and all! Hooray!' he shouted, and then burst into tears.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You ought to go quietly, and you ought to go soon,' said Gandalf. Two<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">or three weeks had passed, and still Frodo made no sign of getting ready to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">go-<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I know. But it is difficult to do both,' he objected. If I just vanish<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">like Bilbo, the tale will be all over the Shire in no time.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Of course you mustn't vanish!' said Gandalf. 'That wouldn't do at all!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I said soon, not instantly. If you can think of any way of slipping out of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Shire without its being generally known, it will be worth a little<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">delay. But you must not delay too long.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'What about the autumn, on or after Our Birthday?' asked Frodo. 'I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">think I could probably make some arrangements by then.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">To tell the truth, he was very reluctant to start, now that it had come<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to the point. Bag End seemed a more desirable residence than it had for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">years, and he wanted to savour as much as he could of his last summer in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Shire. When autumn came, he knew that part at least of his heart would think<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">more kindly of journeying, as it always did at that season. He had indeed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">privately made up his mind to leave on his fiftieth birthday: Bilbo's one<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hundred and twenty-eighth. It seemed somehow the proper day on which to set<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">out and follow him. Following Bilbo was uppermost in his mind, and the one<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">thing that made the thought of leaving bearable. He thought as little as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">possible about the Ring, and where it might lead him in the end. But he did<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">not tell all his thoughts to Gandalf. What the wizard guessed was always<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">difficult to tell.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He looked at Frodo and smiled. 'Very well,' he said. 'I think that will<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">do - but it must not be any later. I am getting very anxious. In the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mean-while, do take care, and don't let out any hint of where you are going!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And see that Sam Gamgee does not talk. If he does, I really shall turn him<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">into a toad.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'As for where I am going,' said Frodo, 'it would be difficult to give<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that away, for I have no clear idea myself, yet.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Don't be absurd!' said Gandalf. 'I am not warning you against leaving<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">an address at the post-office! But you are leaving the Shire - and that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">should not be known, until you are far away. And you must go, or at least<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">set out, either North, South, West or East - and the direction should<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">certainly not be known.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I have been so taken up with the thoughts of leaving Bag End, and of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">saying farewell, that I have never even considered the direction,' said<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo. 'For where am I to go? And by what shall I steer? What is to be my<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">quest? Bilbo went to find a treasure, there and back again; but I go to lose<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">one, and not return, as far as I can see.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'But you cannot see very far,' said Gandalf. 'Neither can I. It may be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">your task to find the Cracks of Doom; but that quest may be for others: I do<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">not know. At any rate you are not ready for that long road yet.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'No indeed!' said Frodo. 'But in the meantime what course am I to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">lake?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Towards danger; but not too rashly, nor too straight,' answered the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wizard. 'If you want my advice, make for Rivendell. That journey should not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">prove too perilous, though the Road is less easy than it was, and it will<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">grow worse as the year fails.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Rivendell!' said Frodo. 'Very good: I will go east, and I will make<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">for Rivendell. I will take Sam to visit the Elves; he will be delighted.' He<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">spoke lightly; but his heart was moved suddenly with a desire to see the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">house of Elrond Halfelven, and breathe the air of that deep valley where<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">many of the Fair Folk still dwelt in peace.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">One summer's evening an astonishing piece of news reached the Ivy Bush<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and Green Dragon. Giants and other portents on the borders of the Shire were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">forgotten for more important matters: Mr. Frodo was selling Bag End, indeed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he had already sold it - to the Sackville-Bagginses!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'For a nice bit, loo,' said some. 'At a bargain price,' said others,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'and that's more likely when Mistress Fobelia's the buyer.' (Otho had died<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">some years before, at the ripe but disappointed age of 102.)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Just why Mr. Frodo was selling his beautiful hole was even more<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">debatable than the price. A few held the theory - supported by the nods and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hints of Mr. Baggins himself - that Frodo's money was running out: he was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">going to leave Hobbiton and live in a quiet way on the proceeds of the sale<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">down in Buckland among his Brandybuck relations. 'As far from the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sackville-Bagginses as may be,' some added. But so firmly fixed had the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">notion of the immeasurable wealth of the Bagginses of Bag End become that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">most found this hard to believe, harder than any other reason or unreason<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that their fancy could suggest: to most it suggested a dark and yet<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">unrevealed plot by Gandalf. Though he kept himself very quiet and did not go<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">about by day, it was well known that he was 'hiding up in the Bag End'. But<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">however a removal might fit in with the designs of his wizardry, there was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">no doubt about the fact: Frodo Baggins was going back to Buckland.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Yes, I shall be moving this autumn,' he said. 'Merry Brandybuck is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">looking out for a nice little hole for me, or perhaps a small house.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As a matter of fact with Merry's help he had already chosen and bought<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a little house at Crickhollow in the country beyond Bucklebury. To all but<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sam he pretended he was going to settle down there permanently. The decision<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to set out eastwards had suggested the idea to him; for Buckland was on the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">eastern borders of the Shire, and as he had lived there in childhood his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">going back would at least seem credible.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gandalf stayed in the Shire for over two months. Then one evening, at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the end of June, soon after Frodo's plan had been finally arranged, he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">suddenly announced that he was going off again next morning. 'Only for a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">short while, I hope,' he said. 'But I am going down beyond the southern<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">borders to get some news, if I can. I have been idle longer than I should.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He spoke lightly, but it seemed to Frodo that he looked rather worried.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Has anything happened?' he asked.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well no; but I have heard something that has made me anxious and needs<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">looking into. If I think it necessary after all for you to get off at once,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I shall come back immediately, or at least send word. In the meanwhile stick<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to your plan; but be more careful than ever, especially of the Ring. Fet me<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">impress on you once more: don't use it!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He went off at dawn. 'I may be back any day,' he said. 'At the very<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">latest I shall come back for the farewell party. I think after all you may<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">need my company on the Road.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At first Frodo was a good deal disturbed, and wondered often what<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gandalf could have heard; but his uneasiness wore off, and in the fine<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">weather he forgot his troubles for a while. The Shire had seldom seen so<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fair a summer, or so rich an autumn: the trees were laden with apples, honey<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was dripping in the combs, and the corn was tall and full.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Autumn was well under way before Frodo began to worry about Gandalf<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">again. September was passing and there was still no news of him. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Birthday, and the removal, drew nearer, and still he did not come, or send<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">word. Bag End began to be busy. Some of Frodo's friends came to stay and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">help him with the packing: there was Fredegar Bolger and Folco Boffin, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of course his special friends Pippin Took and Merry Brandybuck. Between<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">them<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they turned the whole place upside-down.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">On September 20th two covered carts went off laden to Buckland,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">conveying the furniture and goods that Frodo had not sold to his new home,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">by way of the Brandywine Bridge. The next day Frodo became really anxious,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and kept a constant look-out for Gandalf. Thursday, his birthday morning,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dawned as fair and clear as it had long ago for Bilbo's great party. Still<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gandalf did not appear. In the evening Frodo gave his farewell feast: it was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">quite small, just a dinner for himself and his four helpers; but he was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">troubled and fell in no mood for it. The thought that he would so soon have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to part with his young friends weighed on his heart. He wondered how he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">would break it to them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The four younger hobbits were, however, in high spirits, and the party<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">soon became very cheerful in spite of Gandalf s absence. The dining-room was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">bare except for a table and chairs, but the food was good, and there was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">good wine: Frodo's wine had not been included in the sale to the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sackville-Bagginses.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™Whatever happens to the rest of my stuff, when the S.-B.s get their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">claws on it, at any rate I have found a good home for this!' said Frodo, as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he drained his glass. It was the last drop of Old Winyards.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">When they had sung many songs, and talked of many things they had done<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">together, they toasted Bilbo's birthday, and they drank his health and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo's together according to Frodo's custom. Then they went out for a sniff<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of air, and glimpse of the stars, and then they went to bed. Frodo's party<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was over, and Gandalf had not come.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The next morning they were busy packing another cart with the remainder<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of the luggage. Merry took charge of this, and drove off with Fatty (that is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Fredegar Bolger). 'Someone must get there and warm the house before you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">arrive,' said Merry. 'Well, see you later - the day after tomorrow, if you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">don't go to sleep on the way!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Folco went home after lunch, but Pippin remained behind. Frodo was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">restless and anxious, listening in vain for a sound of Gandalf. He decided<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to wait until nightfall. After that, if Gandalf wanted him urgently, he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">would go to Crickhollow, and might even get there first. For Frodo was going<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">on foot. His plan - for pleasure and a last look at the Shire as much as any<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">other reason - was to walk from Hobbiton to Bucklebury Ferry, taking it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fairly easy.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I shall get myself a bit into training, too,' he said, looking at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">himself in a dusty mirror in the half-empty hall. He had not done any<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">strenuous walking for a long time, and the reflection looked rather flabby,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he thought.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After lunch, the Sackville-Bagginses, Lobelia and her sandy-haired son,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Lotho, turned up, much to Frodo's annoyance. 'Ours at last!' said Lobelia,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">as she stepped inside. It was not polite; nor strictly true, for the sale of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bag End did not take effect until midnight. But Lobelia can perhaps be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">forgiven: she had been obliged to wait about seventy-seven years longer for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bag End than she once hoped, and she was now a hundred years old.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Anyway,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">she had come to see that nothing she had paid for had been carried off; and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">she wanted the keys. It took a long while to satisfy her, as she had brought<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a complete inventory with her and went right through it. In the end she<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">departed with Lotho and the spare key and the promise that the other key<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">would be left at the Gamgees' in Bagshot Row. She snorted, and showed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">plainly that she thought the Gamgees capable of plundering the hole during<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the night. Frodo did not offer her any tea.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He took his own tea with Pippin and Sam Gamgee in the kitchen. It had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">been officially announced that Sam was coming to Buckland 'to do for Mr.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo and look after his bit of garden'; an arrangement that was approved by<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Gaffer, though it did not console him for the prospect of having Lobelia<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">as a neighbour.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Our last meal at Bag End!' said Frodo, pushing back his chair. They<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">left the washing up for Lobelia. Pippin and Sam strapped up their three<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">packs and piled them in the porch. Pippin went out for a last stroll in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">garden. Sam disappeared.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The sun went down. Bag End seemed sad and gloomy and dishevelled.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wandered round the familiar rooms, and saw the light of the sunset fade on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the walls, and shadows creep out of the corners. It grew slowly dark<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">indoors. He went out and walked down to the gate at the bottom of the path,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and then on a short way down the Hill Road. He half expected to see Gandalf<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">come striding up through the dusk.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The sky was clear and the stars were growing bright. 'It's going to be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a fine night,' he said aloud. 'That's good for a beginning. I feel like<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">walking. I can't bear any more hanging about. I am going to start, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gandalf must follow me.' He turned to go back, and then slopped, for he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">heard voices, just round the corner by the end of Bagshot Row. One voice was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">certainly the old Gaffer's; the other was strange, and somehow unpleasant.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He could not make out what it said, but he heard the Gaffer's answers, which<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were rather shrill. The old man seemed put out.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'No, Mr. Baggins has gone away. Went this morning, and my Sam went<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">him: anyway all his stuff went. Yes, sold out and gone, I tell'ee. Why?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Why's none of my business, or yours. Where to? That ain't no secret. He's<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">moved to Bucklebury or some such place, away down yonder. Yes it is - a tidy<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">way. I've never been so far myself; they're queer folks in Buckland. No, I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">can't give no message. Good night to you!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Footsteps went away down the Hill. Frodo wondered vaguely why the fact<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that they did not come on up the Hill seemed a great relief. 'I am sick of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">questions and curiosity about my doings, I suppose,' he thought. 'What an<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">inquisitive lot they all are!' He had half a mind to go and ask the Gaffer<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">who the inquirer was; but he thought better (or worse) of it, and turned and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">walked quickly back to Bag End.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Pippin was sitting on his pack in the porch. Sam was not there. Frodo<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stepped inside the dark door. 'Sam!' he called. 'Sam! Time!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Coming, sir!' came the answer from far within, followed soon by Sam<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">himself, wiping his mouth. He had been saying farewell to the beer -barrel in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the cellar.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'All aboard, Sam?' said Frodo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Yes, sir. I'll last for a bit now, sir.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo shut and locked the round door, and gave the key to Sam. 'Run<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">down with this to your home, Sam!' he said. 'Then cut along the Row and meet<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">us as quick as you can at the gate in the lane beyond the meadows. We are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">not going through the village tonight. Too many ears pricking and eyes<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">prying.' Sam ran off at full speed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well, now we're off at last!' said Frodo. They shouldered their packs<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and took up their sticks, and walked round the corner to the west side of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bag End. 'Good-bye!' said Frodo, looking at the dark blank windows. He<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">waved<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his hand, and then turned and (following Bilbo, if he had known it) hurried<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">after Peregrin down the garden-path. They jumped over the low place in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hedge at the bottom and took to the fields, passing into the darkness like a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">rustle in the grasses.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At the bottom of the Hill on its western side they came to the gate<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">opening on to a narrow lane. There they halted and adjusted the straps of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">their packs. Presently Sam appeared, trotting quickly and breathing hard;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his heavy pack was hoisted high on his shoulders, and he had put on his head<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a tall shapeless fell bag, which he called a hat. In the gloom he looked<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">very much like a dwarf.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I am sure you have given me all the heaviest stuff,' said Frodo. 'I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">pity snails, and all that carry their homes on their backs.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I could take a lot more yet, sir. My packet is quite light,' said Sam<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stoutly and untruthfully.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'No, you don't, Sam!' said Pippin. 'It is good for him. He's got<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">nothing except what he ordered us to pack. He's been slack lately, and he'll<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">feel the weight less when he's walked off some of his own.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Be kind to a poor old hobbit!' laughed Frodo. 'I shall be as thin as a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">willow-wand, I'm sure, before I get to Buckland. But I was talking nonsense.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I suspect you have taken more than your share, Sam, and I shall look into it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">at our next packing.' He picked up his stick again. 'Well, we all like<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">walking in the dark,' he said, 'so let's put some miles behind us before<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">bed.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For a short way they followed the lane westwards. Then leaving it they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">turned left and took quietly to the fields again. They went in single file<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">along hedgerows and the borders of coppices, and night fell dark about them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In their dark cloaks they were as invisible as if they all had magic rings.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Since they were all hobbits, and were trying to be silent, they made no<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">noise that even hobbits would hear. Even the wild things in the fields and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">woods hardly noticed their passing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After some time they crossed the Water, west of Hobbiton, by a narrow<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">plank -bridge. The stream was there no more than a winding black ribbon,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">bordered with leaning alder -trees. A mile or two further south they hastily<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">crossed the great road from the Brandywine Bridge; they were now in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Tookland and bending south-eastwards they made for the Green Hill Country.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As they began to climb its first slopes they looked back and saw the lamps<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in Hobbiton far off twinkling in the gentle valley of the Water. Soon it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">disappeared in the folds of the darkened land, and was followed by By water<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">beside its grey pool. When the light of the last farm was far behind,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">peeping among the trees, Frodo turned and waved a hand in farewell.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I wonder if I shall ever look down into that valley again,' he said<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">quietly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">When they had walked for about three hours they rested. The night was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">clear, cool, and starry, but smoke-like wisps of mist were creeping up the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hill-sides from the streams and deep meadows. Thin-clad birches, swaying in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a light wind above their heads, made a black net against the pale sky. They<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ate a very frugal supper (for hobbits), and then went on again. Soon they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">struck a narrow road, that went rolling up and down, fading grey into the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">darkness ahead: the road to Woodhall, and Stock, and the Bucklebury Ferry.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It climbed away from the main road in the Water -valley, and wound over the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">skirts of the Green Hills towards Woody-End, a wild corner of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Eastfarthing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After a while they plunged into a deeply cloven track between tall<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">trees that rustled their dry leaves in the night. It was very dark. At first<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they talked, or hummed a tune softly together, being now far away from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">inquisitive ears. Then they marched on in silence, and Pippin began to lag<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">behind. At last, as they began to climb a steep slope, he stopped and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">yawned.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I am so sleepy,' he said, 'that soon I shall fall down on the road.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Are you going to sleep on your legs? It is nearly midnight.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I thought you liked walking in the dark,' said Frodo. 'But there is no<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">great hurry. Merry expects us some time the day after tomorrow; but that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">leaves us nearly two days more. We'll halt at the first likely spot.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'The wind's in the West,' said Sam. 'If we get to the other side of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">this hill, we shall find a spot that is sheltered and snug enough, sir.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There is a dry fir-wood just ahead, if I remember rightly.' Sam knew the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">land well within twenty miles of Hobbiton, but that was the limit of his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">geography.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Just over the top of the hill they came on the patch of fir-wood.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Leaving the road they went into the deep resin-scented darkness of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">trees, and gathered dead sticks and cones to make a fire. Soon they had a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">merry crackle of flame at the foot of a large fir-tree and they sat round it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">for a while, until they began to nod. Then, each in an angle of the great<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">tree's roots, they curled up in their cloaks and blankets, and were soon<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fast asleep. They set no watch; even Frodo feared no danger yet, for they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were still in the heart of the Shire. A few creatures came and looked at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">them when the fire had died away. A fox passing through the wood on business<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of his own stopped several minutes and sniffed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Hobbits!' he thought. 'Well, what next? I have heard of strange doings<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in this land, but I have seldom heard of a hobbit sleeping out of doors<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">under a tree. Three of them! There's something mighty queer behind this.' He<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was quite right, but he never found out any more about it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The morning came, pale and clammy. Frodo woke up first, and found that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a tree-root had made a hole in his back, and that his neck was stiff.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Walking for pleasure! Why didn't I drive?' he thought, as he usually<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">did at the beginning of an expedition. 'And all my beautiful feather beds<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">are sold to the Sackville-Bagginses! These tree-roots would do them good.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He stretched. 'Wake up, hobbits!' he cried. It's a beautiful morning.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'What's beautiful about it?' said Pippin, peering over the edge of his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">blanket with one eye. 'Sam! Gel breakfast ready for half-past nine! Have you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">got the bath-water hot?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sam jumped up, looking rather bleary. 'No, sir, I haven't, sir!' he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">said.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo stripped the blankets from Pippin and rolled him over, and then<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">walked off to the edge of the wood. Away eastward the sun was rising red out<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of the mists that lay thick on the world. Touched with gold and red the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">autumn trees seemed to be sailing rootless in a shadowy sea. A little below<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">him to the left the road ran down steeply into a hollow and disappeared.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">When he returned Sam and Pippin had got a good fire going. 'Water!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shouted Pippin. 'Where's the water?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I don't keep water in my pockets,' said Frodo. 'We thought you had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">gone to find some,' said Pippin, busy setting out the food, and cups. 'You<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">had better go now.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You can come too,' said Frodo, 'and bring all the water-bottles.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There was a stream at the foot of the hill. They filled their bottles and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the small camping kettle at a little fall where the water fell a few feet<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">over an outcrop of grey stone. It was icy cold; and they spluttered and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">puffed as they bathed their faces and hands.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">When their breakfast was over, and their packs all trussed up again, it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was after ten o'clock, and the day was beginning to turn fine and hot. They<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">went down the slope, and across the stream where it dived under the road,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and up the next slope, and up and down another shoulder of the hills; and by<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that time their cloaks, blankets, water, food, and other gear already seemed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a heavy burden.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The day's march promised to be warm and tiring work. After some miles,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">however, the road ceased to roll up and down: it climbed to the top of a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">steep bank in a weary zig-zagging sort of way, and then prepared to go down<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">for the last time. In front of them they saw the lower lands dotted with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">small clumps of trees that melted away in the distance to a brown woodland<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">haze. They were looking across the Woody End towards the Brandywine<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">River.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The road wound away before them like a piece of string.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™The road goes on for ever,' said Pippin; 'but I can't without a rest.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It is high time for lunch.' He sat down on the bank at the side of the road<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and looked away east into the haze, beyond which lay the River, and the end<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of the Shire in which he had spent all his life. Sam stood by him. His round<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">eyes were wide open - for he was looking across lands he had never seen to a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">new horizon.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Do Elves live in those woods?' he asked.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Not that I ever heard,' said Pippin. Frodo was silent. He too was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">gazing eastward along the road, as if he had never seen it before. Suddenly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he spoke, aloud but as if to himself, saying slowly:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Road goes ever on and on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Down from the door where it began.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Now far ahead the Road has gone,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And I must follow, if I can,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Pursuing it with weary feet,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Until it joins some larger way,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Where many paths and errands meet.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And whither then? I cannot say.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'That sounds like a bit of old Bilbo's rhyming,' said Pippin. 'Or is it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">one of your imitations? It does not sound altogether encouraging.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I don't know,' said Frodo. It came to me then, as if I was making it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">up; but I may have heard it long ago. Certainly it reminds me very much of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bilbo in the last years, before he went away. He used often to say there was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">only one Road; that it was like a great river: its springs were at every<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">doorstep, and every path was its tributary. "It's a dangerous business,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo, going out of your door," he used to say. "You step into the Road, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">if you don't keep your feet, there is no knowing where you might be swept<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">off to. Do you realize that this is the very path that goes through<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mirkwood, and that if you let it, it might take you to the Lonely Mountain<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">or even further and to worse places?" He used to say that on the path<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">outside the front door at Bag End, especially after he had been out for a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">long walk.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well, the Road wonâ€™t sweep me anywhere for an hour at least,' said<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Pippin, unslinging his pack. The others followed his example, putting their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">packs against the bank and their legs out into the road. After a rest they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">had a good lunch, and then more rest.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The sun was beginning to get low and the light of afternoon was on the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">land as they went down the hill. So far they had not met a soul on the road.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">This way was not much used, being hardly fit for carts, and there was little<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">traffic to the Woody End. They had been jogging along again for an hour or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">more when Sam stopped a moment as if listening. They were now on level<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ground, and the road after much winding lay straight ahead through<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">grass-land sprinkled with tall trees, outliers of the approaching woods.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I can hear a pony or a horse coming along the road behind,' said Sam.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They looked back, but the turn of the road prevented them from seeing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">far. 'I wonder if that is Gandalf coming after us,' said Frodo; but even as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he said it, he had a feeling that it was not so, and a sudden desire to hide<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">from the view of the rider came over him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'It may not matter much,' he said apologetically, 'but I would rather<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">not be seen on the road - by anyone. I am sick of my doings being noticed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and discussed. And if it is Gandalf,' he added as an afterthought, 'we can<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">give him a little surprise, to pay him out for being so late. Let's get out<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of sight!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The other two ran quickly to the left and down into a little hollow not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">far from the road. There they lay flat. Frodo hesitated for a second:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">curiosity or some other feeling was struggling with his desire to hide. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sound of hoofs drew nearer. Just in time he threw himself down in a patch of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">long grass behind a tree that overshadowed the road. Then he lifted his head<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and peered cautiously above one of the great roots.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Round the corner came a black horse, no hobbit-pony but a full-sized<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">horse; and on it sat a large man, who seemed to crouch in the saddle,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wrapped in a great black cloak and hood, so that only his boots in the high<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stirrups showed below; his face was shadowed and invisible.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">When it reached the tree and was level with Frodo the horse stopped.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The riding figure sat quite still with its head bowed, as if listening. From<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">inside the hood came a noise as of someone sniffing to catch an elusive<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">scent; the head turned from side to side of the road.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A sudden unreasoning fear of discovery laid hold of Frodo, and he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">thought of his Ring. He hardly dared to breathe, and yet the desire to get<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it out of his pocket became so strong that he began slowly to move his hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He felt that he had only to slip it on, and then he would be safe. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">advice of Gandalf seemed absurd. Bilbo had used the Ring. 'And I am still in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Shire,' he thought, as his hand touched the chain on which it hung. At<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that moment the rider sat up, and shook the reins. The horse stepped<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">forward, walking slowly at first, and then breaking into a quick trot.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo crawled to the edge of the road and watched the rider, until he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dwindled into the distance. He could not be quite sure, but it seemed to him<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that suddenly, before it passed out of sight, the horse turned aside and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">went into the trees on the right.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well, I call that very queer, and indeed disturbing,' said Frodo to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">himself, as he walked towards his companions. Pippin and Sam had remained<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">flat in the grass, and had seen nothing; so Frodo described the rider and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his strange behaviour.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I can't say why, but I felt certain he was looking or smelling for me;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and also I felt certain that I did not want him to discover me. I've never<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">seen or fell anything like it in the Shire before.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'But what has one of the Big People got to do with us?' said Pippin.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'And what is he doing in this part of the world?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'There are some Men about,' said Frodo. 'Down in the Southfarthing they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">have had trouble with Big People, I believe. But I have never heard of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">anything like this rider. I wonder where he comes from.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Begging your pardon,' put in Sam suddenly, 'I know where he comes<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">from. It's from Hobbiton that this here black rider comes, unless there's<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">more than one. And I know where he's going to.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'What do you mean?' said Frodo sharply, looking at him in astonishment.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Why didn't you speak up before?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I have only just remembered, sir. It was like this: when I got back to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">our hole yesterday evening with the key, my dad, he says to me: Hello, Sam!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he says. I thought you were away with Mr. Frodo this morning. There's been a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">strange customer asking for Mr. Baggins of Bag End, and he's only just gone.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I've sent him on to Bucklebury. Not that Hiked the sound of him. He seemed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mighty put out, when I told him Mr. Baggins had left his old home for good.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Hissed at me, he did. It gave me quite a shudder. What sort of a fellow was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he? says I to the Gaffer. / don 't know, says he; but he wasn 't a hobbit. He<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was tall and black-like, and he stooped aver me. I reckon it was one of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Big Folk from foreign parts. He spoke funny.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I couldn't stay to hear more, sir, since you were waiting; and I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">didn't give much heed to it myself. The Gaffer is getting old, and more than<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a bit blind, and it must have been near dark when this fellow come up the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Hill and found him taking the air at the end of our Row. I hope he hasn't<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">done no harm, sir, nor me.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'The Gaffer can't be blamed anyway,' said Frodo. 'As a matter of fact I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">heard him talking to a stranger, who seemed to be inquiring for me, and I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">nearly went and asked him who it was. I wish I had, or you had told me about<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it before. I might have been more careful on the road.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Still, there may be no connexion between this rider and the Gaffer's<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stranger,' said Pippin. 'We left Hobbiton secretly enough, and I don't see<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">how he could have followed us.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'What about the smelling, sir?' said Sam. 'And the Gaffer said he was a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">black chap.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I wish I had waited for Gandalf,' Frodo muttered. 'But perhaps it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">would only have made matters worse.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Then you know or guess something about this rider?' said Pippin, who<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">had caught the muttered words.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I don't know, and I would rather not guess,' said Frodo. 'All right,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">cousin Frodo! You can keep your secret for the present, if you want to be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mysterious. In the meanwhile what are we to do? I should like a bite and a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sup, but somehow I think we had better move on from here. Your talk of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sniffing riders with invisible noses has unsettled me.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Yes, I think we will move on now,' said Frodo; 'but not on the road<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">-in case that rider comes back, or another follows him. We ought to do a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">good step more today. Buckland is still miles away.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The shadows of the trees were long and thin on the grass, as they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">started off again. They now kept a stone's throw to the left of the road,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and kept out of sight of it as much as they could. But this hindered them;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">for the grass was thick and tussocky, and the ground uneven, and the trees<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">began to draw together into thickets.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The sun had gone down red behind the hills at their backs, and evening<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was coming on before they came back to the road at the end of the long level<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">over which it had run straight for some miles. At that point it bent left<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and went down into the lowlands of the Yale making for Stock; but a lane<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">branched right, winding through a wood of ancient oak-trees on its way to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Woodhall. 'That is the way for us,' said Frodo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Not far from the road-meeting they came on the huge hulk of a tree: it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was still alive and had leaves on the small branches that it had put out<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">round the broken stumps of its long-fallen limbs; but it was hollow, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">could be entered by a great crack on the side away from the road. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hobbits crept inside, and sat there upon a floor of old leaves and decayed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wood. They rested and had a light meal, talking quietly and listening from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">time to time.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Twilight was about them as they crept back to the lane. The West wind<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was sighing in the branches. Leaves were whispering. Soon the road began to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fall gently but steadily into the dusk. A star came out above the trees in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the darkening East before them. They went abreast and in step, to keep up<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">their spirits. After a time, as the stars grew thicker and brighter, the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">feeling of disquiet left them, and they no longer listened for the sound of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hoofs. They began to hum softly, as hobbits have a way of doing as they walk<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">along, especially when they are drawing near to home at night. With most<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hobbits it is a supper-song or a bed-song; but these hobbits hummed a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">walking-song (though not, of course, without any mention of supper and bed).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bilbo Baggins had made the words, to a tune that was as old as the hills,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and taught it to Frodo as they walked in the lanes of the Water -valley and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">talked about Adventure.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Upon the hearth the fire is red,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Beneath the roof there is a bed;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But not yet weary are our feet,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Still round the corner we may meet<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A sudden tree or standing stone<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">That none have seen but we alone.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Tree and flower and leaf and grass,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Let them pass! Let them pass!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Hill and water under sky,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Pass them by! Pass them by!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Still round the corner there may wait<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A new road or a secret gate,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And though we pass them by today,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Tomorrow we may come this way<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And take the hidden paths that run<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Towards the Moon or to the Sun.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Fare you well! Fare you well!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Home is behind, the world ahead,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And there are many paths to tread<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Through shadows to the edge of night,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Until the stars are all alight.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Then world behind and home ahead,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">We'll wander back to home and bed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mist and twilight, cloud and shade,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Away shall fade! Away shall fade!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Fire and lamp, and meat and bread,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And then to bed! And then to bed!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The song ended. 'And now to bed! And now to bed!' sang Pippin in a high<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">voice.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Hush!' said Frodo. 'I think I hear hoofs again.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They slopped suddenly and stood as silent as tree-shadows, listening.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There was a sound of hoofs in the lane, some way behind, but coming slow and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">clear down the wind. Quickly and quietly they slipped off the path, and ran<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">into the deeper shade under the oak-trees.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Don't let us go too far!' said Frodo. 'I don't want to be seen, but I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">want to see if it is another Black Rider.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Very well!' said Pippin. 'But don't forget the sniffing!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The hoofs drew nearer. They had no time to find any hiding-place better<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">than the general darkness under the trees; Sam and Pippin crouched behind a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">large tree-bole, while Frodo crept back a few yards towards the lane. It<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">showed grey and pale, a line of fading light through the wood. Above it the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stars were thick in the dim sky, but there was no moon.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The sound of hoofs stopped. As Frodo watched he saw something dark pass<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">across the lighter space between two trees, and then halt. It looked like<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the black shade of a horse led by a smaller black shadow. The black shadow<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stood close to the point where they had left the path, and it swayed from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">side to side. Frodo thought he heard the sound of snuffling. The shadow bent<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to the ground, and then began to crawl towards him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Once more the desire to slip on the Ring came over Frodo; but this time<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it was stronger than before. So strong that, almost before he realized what<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he was doing, his hand was groping in his pocket. But at that moment there<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">came a sound like mingled song and laughter. Clear voices rose and fell in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the starlit air. The black shadow straightened up and retreated. It climbed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">on to the shadowy horse and seemed to vanish across the lane into the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">darkness on the other side. Frodo breathed again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Elves!' exclaimed Sam in a hoarse whisper. 'Elves, sir!' He would have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">burst out of the trees and dashed off towards the voices, if they had not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">pulled him back.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Yes, it is Elves,' said Frodo. 'One can meet them sometimes in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Woody End. They don't live in the Shire, but they wander into it in Spring<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and Autumn, out of their own lands away beyond the Tower Hills. I am<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">thankful that they do! You did not see, but that Black Rider stopped just<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">here and was actually crawling towards us when the song began. As soon as he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">heard the voices he slipped away.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'What about the Elves?' said Sam, too excited to trouble about the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">rider. 'Can't we go and see them?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Listen! They are coming this way,' said Frodo. 'We have only to wait.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The singing drew nearer. One clear voice rose now above the others. It was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">singing in the fair elven-tongue, of which Frodo knew only a little, and the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">others knew nothing. Yet the sound blending with the melody seemed to shape<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">itself in their thought into words which they only partly understood. This<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was the song as Frodo heard it:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Snow-white! Snow-white! O Lady clear!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">O Queen beyond the Western Seas!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">O Light to us that wander here<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Clear are thy eyes and bright thy breath!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Snow-white! Snow-white! We sing to thee<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In a far land beyond the Sea.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">O stars that in the Sunless Year<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">With shining hand by her were sawn,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">We see your silver blossom blown!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">O Elbereth! Gilthoniel!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">We still remember, we who dwell<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In this far land beneath the trees,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Thy starlight on the Western Seas.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The song ended. These are High Elves! They spoke the name of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Elbereth!' said Frodo in amazement, 'Few of that fairest folk are ever seen<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in the Shire. Not many now remain in Middle-earth, east of the Great Sea.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">This is indeed a strange chance!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The hobbits sat in shadow by the wayside. Before long the Elves came<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">down the lane towards the valley. They passed slowly, and the hobbits could<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">see the starlight glimmering on their hair and in their eyes. They bore no<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">lights, yet as they walked a shimmer, like the light of the moon above the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">rim of the hills before it rises, seemed to fall about their feet. They were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">now silent, and as the last Elf passed he turned and looked towards the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hobbits and laughed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Hail, Frodo!' he cried. 'You are abroad late. Or are you perhaps<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">lost?' Then he called aloud to the others, and all the company stopped and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">gathered round.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'This is indeed wonderful!' they said. 'Three hobbits in a wood at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">night! We have not seen such a thing since Bilbo went away. What is the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">meaning of it?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'The meaning of it, fair people,' said Frodo, 'is simply that we seem<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to be going the same way as you are. I like walking under the stars. But I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">would welcome your company.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'But we have no need of other company, and hobbits are so dull,' they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">laughed. 'And how do you know that we go the same way as you, for you do<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">know whither we are going?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'And how do you know my name?' asked Frodo in return.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'We know many things,' they said. 'We have seen you often before with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bilbo, though you may not have seen us.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Who are you, and who is your lord?' asked Frodo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I am Gildor,' answered their leader, the Elf who had first hailed him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Gildor Inglorion of the House of Finrod. We are Exiles, and most of our<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">kindred have long ago departed and we too are now only tarrying here a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">while, ere we return over the Great Sea. But some of our kinsfolk dwell<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">still in peace in Rivendell. Come now, Frodo, tell us what you are doing?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For we see that there is some shadow of fear upon you.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'O Wise People!' interrupted Pippin eagerly. â€™Tell us about the Black<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Riders!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Black Riders?' they said in low voices. 'Why do you ask about Black<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Riders?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Because two Black Riders have overtaken us today, or one has done so<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">twice,' said Pippin; 'only a little while ago he slipped away as you drew<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">near.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Elves did not answer at once, but spoke together softly in their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">own tongue. At length Gildor turned to the hobbits. 'We will not speak of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">this here,' he said. 'We think you had best come now with us. It is not our<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">custom, but for this time we will lake you on our road, and you shall lodge<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with us tonight, if you will.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'O Fair Folk! This is good fortune beyond my hope,' said Pippin. Sam<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was speechless. 'I thank you indeed, Gildor Inglorion,' said Frodo bowing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Elen snla lÂ®menn' omentielvo, a star shines on the hour of our meeting,' he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">added in the high-elven speech.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Be careful, friends!' cried Gildor laughing. 'Speak no secrets! Here<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">is a scholar in the Ancient Tongue. Bilbo was a good master. Hail,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Elf-friend!' he said, bowing to Frodo. 'Come now with your friends and join<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">our company! You had best walk in the middle so that you may not stray. You<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">may be weary before we halt.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Why? Where are you going?' asked Frodo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'For tonight we go to the woods on the hills above Woodhall. It is some<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">miles, but you shall have rest at the end of it, and it will shorten your<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">journey tomorrow.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They now marched on again in silence, and passed like shadows and faint<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">lights: for Elves (even more than hobbits) could walk when they wished<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">without sound or footfall. Pippin soon began to feel sleepy, and staggered<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">once or twice; but each time a tall Elf at his side put out his arm and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">saved him from a fall. Sam walked along at Frodo's side, as if in a dream,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with an expression on his face half of fear and half of astonished joy.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The woods on either side became denser; the trees were now younger and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">thicker; and as the lane went lower, running down into a fold of the hills,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">there were many deep brakes of hazel on the rising slopes at either hand. At<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">last the Elves turned aside from the path. A green ride lay almost unseen<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">through the thickets on the right; and this they followed as it wound away<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">back up the wooded slopes on to the top of a shoulder of the hills that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stood out into the lower land of the river -valley. Suddenly they came out of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the shadow of the trees, and before them lay a wide space of grass, grey<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">under the night. On three sides the woods pressed upon it; but eastward the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ground fell steeply and the tops of the dark trees, growing at the bottom of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the slope, were below their feet. Beyond, the low lands lay dim and flat<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">under the stars. Nearer at hand a few lights twinkled in the village of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Woodhall.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Elves sat on the grass and spoke together in soft voices; they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">seemed to take no further notice of the hobbits. Frodo and his companions<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wrapped themselves in cloaks and blankets, and drowsiness stole over them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The night grew on, and the lights in the valley went out. Pippin fell<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">asleep, pillowed on a green hillock.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Away high in the East swung Remmirath, the Netted Stars, and slowly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">above the mists red Borgil rose, glowing like a jewel of fire. Then by some<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shift of airs all the mist was drawn away like a veil, and there leaned up,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">as he climbed over the rim of the world, the Swordsman of the Sky,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Menelvagor with his shining belt. The Elves all burst into song. Suddenly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">under the trees a fire sprang up with a red light.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Come!' the Elves called to the hobbits. 'Come! Now is the time for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">speech and merriment!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Pippin sat up and rubbed his eyes. He shivered. 'There is a fire in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hall, and food for hungry guests,' said an Elf standing before him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At the south end of the greensward there was an opening. There the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">green floor ran on into the wood, and formed a wide space like a hall,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">roofed by the boughs of trees. Their great trunks ran like pillars down each<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">side. In the middle there was a wood-fire blazing, and upon the tree-pillars<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">torches with lights of gold and silver were burning steadily. The Elves sat<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">round the fire upon the grass or upon the sawn rings of old trunks. Some<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">went to and fro bearing cups and pouring drink; others brought food on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">heaped plates and dishes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'This is poor fare,' they said to the hobbits; 'for we are lodging in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the greenwood far from our halls. If ever you are our guests at home, we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">will treat you better.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'It seems to me good enough for a birthday-party,' said Frodo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Pippin afterwards recalled little of either food or drink, for his mind<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was filled with the light upon the elf-faces, and the sound of voices so<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">various and so beautiful that he felt in a waking dream. But he remembered<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that there was bread, surpassing the savour of a fair white loaf to one who<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">is starving; and fruits sweet as wildberries and richer than the tended<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fruits of gardens; he drained a cup that was filled with a fragrant draught,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">cool as a clear fountain, golden as a summer afternoon.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sam could never describe in words, nor picture clearly to himself, what<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he felt or thought that night, though it remained in his memory as one of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the chief events of his life. The nearest he ever got was to say: 'Well,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sir, if I could grow apples like that, I would call myself a gardener. But<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it was the singing that went to my heart, if you know what I mean.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo sat, eating, drinking, and talking with delight; but his mind was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">chiefly on the words spoken. He knew a little of the elf-speech and listened<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">eagerly. Now and again he spoke to those that served him and thanked them in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">their own language. They smiled at him and said laughing: 'Here is a jewel<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">among hobbits!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After a while Pippin fell fast asleep, and was lifted up and borne away<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to a bower under the trees; there he was laid upon a soft bed and slept the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">rest of the night away. Sam refused to leave his master. When Pippin had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">gone, he came and sat curled up at Frodo's feet, where at last he nodded and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">closed his eyes. Frodo remained long awake, talking with Gildor.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They spoke of many things, old and new, and Frodo questioned Gildor<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">much about happenings in the wide world outside the Shire. The tidings were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mostly sad and ominous: of gathering darkness, the wars of Men, and the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">flight of the Elves. At last Frodo asked the question that was nearest to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his heart:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Tell me, Gildor, have you ever seen Bilbo since he left us?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gildor smiled. 'Yes,' he answered. 'Twice. He said farewell to us on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">this very spot. But I saw him once again, far from here.' He would say no<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">more about Bilbo, and Frodo fell silent.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You do not ask me or tell me much that concerns yourself, Frodo,' said<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gildor. 'But I already know a little, and I can read more in your face and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in the thought behind your questions. You are leaving the Shire, and yet you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">doubt that you will find what you seek, or accomplish what you intend, or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that you will ever return. Is not that so?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'It is,' said Frodo; 'but I thought my going was a secret known only to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gandalf and my faithful Sam.' He looked down at Sam, who was snoring<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">gently.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'The secret will not reach the Enemy from us,' said Gildor.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'The Enemy?' said Frodo. 'Then you know why I am leaving the Shire?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I do not know for what reason the Enemy is pursuing you,' answered<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gildor; 'but I perceive that he is - strange indeed though that seems to me.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And I warn you that peril is now both before you and behind you, and upon<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">either side.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You mean the Riders? I feared that they were servants of the Enemy.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">What are the Black Riders?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Has Gandalf told you nothing?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Nothing about such creatures.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Then I think it is not for me to say more - lest terror should keep<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you from your journey. For it seems to me that you have set out only just in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">time, if indeed you are in time. You must now make haste, and neither stay<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">nor turn back; for the Shire is no longer any protection to you.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I cannot imagine what information could be more terrifying than your<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hints and warnings,' exclaimed Frodo. 'I knew that danger lay ahead, of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">course; but I did not expect to meet it in our own Shire. Can't a hobbit<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">walk from the Water to the River in peace?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'But it is not your own Shire,' said Gildor. 'Others dwelt here before<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hobbits were; and others will dwell here again when hobbits are no more. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wide world is all about you: you can fence yourselves in, but you cannot for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ever fence it out.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I know - and yet it has always seemed so safe and familiar. What can I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">do now? My plan was to leave the Shire secretly, and make my way to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Rivendell; but now my footsteps are dogged, before ever I get to Buckland.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I think you should still follow that plan,' said Gildor. 'I do not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">think the Road will prove too hard for your courage. But if you desire<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">clearer counsel, you should ask Gandalf. I do not know the reason for your<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">flight, and therefore I do not know by what means your pursuers will assail<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you. These things Gandalf must know. I suppose that you will see him before<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you leave the Shire?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I hope so. But that is another thing that makes me anxious. I have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">been expecting Gandalf for many days. He was to have come to Hobbiton at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">latest two nights ago; but he has never appeared. Now I am wondering what<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">can have happened. Should I wait for him?â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gildor was silent for a moment. 'I do not like this news,' he said at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">last. 'That Gandalf should be late, does not bode well. But it is said: Do<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">not meddle in the affairs of Wizards, for they are subtle and quick to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">anger. The choice is yours: to go or wait.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'And it is also said,' answered Frodo: 'Go not to the Elves for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">counsel, for they will say both no and yes. '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Is it indeed?' laughed Gildor. 'Elves seldom give unguarded advice,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">for advice is a dangerous gift, even from the wise to the wise, and all<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">courses may run ill. But what would you? You have not told me all concerning<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">yourself; and how then shall I choose better than you? But if you demand<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">advice, I will for friendship's sake give it. I think you should now go at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">once, without delay; and if Gandalf does not come before you set out, then I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">also advise this: do not go alone. Take such friends as are trusty and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">willing. Now you should be grateful, for I do not give this counsel gladly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Elves have their own labours and their own sorrows, and they are little<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">concerned with the ways of hobbits, or of any other creatures upon earth.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Our paths cross theirs seldom, by chance or purpose. In this meeting there<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">may be more than chance; but the purpose is not clear to me, and I fear to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">say too much.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I am deeply grateful,' said Frodo; 'but I wish you would tell me<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">plainly what the Black Riders are. If I take your advice I may not see<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gandalf for a long while, and I ought to know what is the danger that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">pursues me.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Is it not enough to know that they are servants of the Enemy?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">answered Gildor. 'Flee them! Speak no words to them! They are deadly. Ask no<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">more of me! But my heart forbodes that, ere all is ended, you, Frodo son of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Drogo, will know more of these fell things than Gildor Inglorion. May<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Elbereth protect you!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'But where shall I find courage?' asked Frodo. 'That is what I chiefly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">need.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Courage is found in unlikely places,' said Gildor. 'Be of good hope!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sleep now! In the morning we shall have gone; but we will send our messages<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">through the lands. The Wandering Companies shall know of your journey,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">those that have power for good shall be on the watch. I name you Elf-friend;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and may the stars shine upon the end of your road! Seldom have we had such<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">delight in strangers, and it is fair to hear words of the Ancient Speech<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">from the lips of other wanderers in the world.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo felt sleep coming upon him, even as Gildor finished speaking. 'I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">will sleep now,' he said; and the Elf led him to a bower beside Pippin, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he threw himself upon a bed and fell at once into a dreamless slumber.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the morning Frodo woke refreshed. He was lying in a bower made by a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">living tree with branches laced and drooping to the ground; his bed was of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fern and grass, deep and soft and strangely fragrant. The sun was shining<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">through the fluttering leaves, which were still green upon the tree. He<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">jumped up and went out.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sam was sitting on the grass near the edge of the wood. Pippin was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">standing studying the sky and weather. There was no sign of the Elves.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'They have left us fruit and drink, and bread,' said Pippin. 'Come and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">have your breakfast. The bread tastes almost as good as it did last night. I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">did not want to leave you any, but Sam insisted.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo sat down beside Sam and began to eat. 'What is the plan for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">today?' asked Pippin.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'To walk to Bucklebury as quickly as possible,' answered Frodo, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">gave his attention to the food.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Do you think we shall see anything of those Riders?' asked Pippin<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">cheerfully. Under the morning sun the prospect of seeing a whole troop of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">them did not seem very alarming to him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Yes, probably,' said Frodo, not liking the reminder. 'But I hope to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">get across the river without their seeing us.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Did you find out anything about them from Gildor?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Not much - only hints and riddles,' said Frodo evasively. 'Did you ask<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">about the sniffing?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'We didn't discuss it,' said Frodo with his mouth full.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You should have. I am sure it is very important.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'In that case I am sure Gildor would have refused to explain it,' said<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo sharply. 'And now leave me in peace for a bit! I don't want to answer<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a string of questions while I am eating. I want to think!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Good heavens!' said Pippin. 'At breakfast?' He walked away towards the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">edge of the green.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">From Frodo' s mind the bright morning - treacherously bright, he thought<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">- had not banished the fear of pursuit; and he pondered the words of Gildor.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The merry voice of Pippin came to him. He was running on the green turf and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">singing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'No! I could not!' he said to himself. 'It is one thing to take my<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">young friends walking over the Shire with me, until we are hungry and weary,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and food and bed are sweet. To take them into exile, where hunger and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">weariness may have no cure, is quite another - even if they are willing to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">come. The inheritance is mine alone. I don't think I ought even to take<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sam.' He looked at Sam Gamgee, and discovered that Sam was watching him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well, Sam!' he said. 'What about it? I am leaving the Shire as soon as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ever I can - in fact I have made up my mind now not even to wait a day at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Crickhollow, if it can be helped.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Very good, sir!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You still mean to come with me?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I do.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'It is going to be very dangerous, Sam. 'It is already dangerous. Most<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">likely neither of us will come back.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'If you don't come back, sir, then I shan't, that's certain,' said Sam.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Don't you leave him! they said to me. Leave him! I said. I never mean to. I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">am going with him, if he climbs to the Moon, and if any of those Black<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Rulers try to stop him, they'll have Sam Gamgee to reckon with, I said. They<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">laughed.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Who are they, and what are you talking about?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'The Elves, sir. We had some talk last night; and they seemed to know<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you were going away, so I didn't see the use of denying it. Wonderful folk,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Elves, sir! Wonderful!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'They are,' said Frodo. 'Do you like them still, now you have had a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">closer view?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'They seem a bit above my likes and dislikes, so to speak,' answered<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sam slowly. 'It don't seem to matter what I think about them. They are quite<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">different from what I expected - so old and young, and so gay and sad, as it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo looked at Sam rather startled, half expecting to see some outward<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sign of the odd change that seemed to have come over him. It did not sound<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">like the voice of the old Sam Gamgee that he thought he knew. But it looked<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">like the old Sam Gamgee sitting there, except that his face was unusually<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">thoughtful.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Do you feel any need to leave the Shire now - now that your wish to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">see them has come true already?' he asked.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Yes, sir. I don't know how to say it, but after last night I feel<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">different. I seem to see ahead, in a kind of way. I know we are going to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">take a very long road, into darkness; but I know I can't turn back. It isn't<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to see Elves now, nor dragons, nor mountains, that I want - 1 don't rightly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">know what I want: but I have something to do before the end, and it lies<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ahead, not in the Shire. I must see it through, sir, if you understand me.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I don't altogether. But I understand that Gandalf chose me a good<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">companion. I am content. We will go together.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo finished his breakfast in silence. Then standing up he looked<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">over the land ahead, and called to Pippin.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'All ready to start?' he said as Pippin ran up. 'We must be getting off<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">at once. We slept late; and there are a good many miles to go.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You slept late, you mean,' said Pippin. 'I was up long before; and we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">are only waiting for you to finish eating and thinking.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I have finished both now. And I am going to make for Bucklebury Ferry<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">as quickly as possible. I am not going out of the way, back to the road we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">left last night: I am going to cut straight across country from here.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Then you are going to fly,' said Pippin. 'You won't cut straight on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">foot anywhere in this country.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'We can cut straighter than the road anyway,' answered Frodo. 'The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Ferry is east from Woodhall; but the hard road curves away to the left -you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">can see a bend of it away north over there. It goes round the north end of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Marish so as to strike the causeway from the Bridge above Stock. But<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that is miles out of the way. We could save a quarter of the distance if we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">made a line for the Ferry from where we stand.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Short cuts make long delays, ' argued Pippin. 'The country is rough<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">round here, and there are bogs and all kinds of difficulties down in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Marish -I know the land in these parts. And if you are worrying about Black<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Riders, I can't see that it is any worse meeting them on a road than in a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wood or a field.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'It is less easy to find people in the woods and fields,' answered<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo. 'And if you are supposed to be on the road, there is some chance that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you will be looked for on the road and not off it.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'All right!' said Pippin. 'I will follow you into every bog and ditch.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But it is hard! I had counted on passing the Golden Perch at Stock before<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sundown. The best beer in the Eastfarthing, or used to be: it is a long time<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">since I tasted it.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'That settles it!' said Frodo. 'Short cuts make delays, but inns make<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">longer ones. At all costs we must keep you away from the Golden Perch. We<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">want to get to Bucklebury before dark. What do you say, Sam?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I will go along with you, Mr. Frodo,' said Sam (in spite of private<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">misgiving and a deep regret for the best beer in the Eastfarthing).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Then if we are going to toil through bog and briar, let's go now!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">said Pippin.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It was already nearly as hot as it had been the day before; but clouds<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were beginning to come up from the West. It looked likely to turn to rain.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The hobbits scrambled down a steep green bank and plunged into the thick<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">trees below. Their course had been chosen to leave Woodhall to their left,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and to cut slanting through the woods that clustered along the eastern side<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of the hills, until they reached the flats beyond. Then they could make<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">straight for the Ferry over country that was open, except for a few ditches<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and fences. Frodo reckoned they had eighteen miles to go in a straight line.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He soon found that the thicket was closer and more tangled than it had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">appeared. There were no paths in the undergrowth, and they did not get on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">very fast. When they had struggled to the bottom of the bank, they found a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stream running down from the hills behind in a deeply dug bed with steep<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">slippery sides overhung with brambles. Most inconveniently it cut across the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">line they had chosen. They could not jump over it, nor indeed get across it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">at all without getting wet, scratched, and muddy. They halted, wondering<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">what to do. 'First check!' said Pippin, smiling grimly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sam Gamgee looked back. Through an opening in the trees he caught a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">glimpse of the top of the green bank from which they had climbed down.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Look!' he said, clutching Frodo by the arm. They all looked, and on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the edge high above them they saw against the sky a horse standing. Beside<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it stooped a black figure.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They at once gave up any idea of going back. Frodo led the way, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">plunged quickly into the thick bushes beside the stream. 'Whew!' he said to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Pippin. 'We were both right! The short cut has gone crooked already; but we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">got under cover only just in time. You've got sharp ears, Sam: can you hear<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">anything coming?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They stood still, almost holding their breath as they listened; but<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">there was no sound of pursuit. 'I don't fancy he would try bringing his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">horse down that bank,' said Sam. 'But I guess he knows we came down it. We<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">had better be going on.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Going on was not altogether easy. They had packs to carry, and the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">bushes and brambles were reluctant to let them through. They were cut off<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">from the wind by the ridge behind, and the air was still and stuffy. When<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they forced their way at last into more open ground, they were hot and tired<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and very scratched, and they were also no longer certain of the direction in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">which they were going. The banks of the stream sank, as it reached the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">levels and became broader and shallower, wandering off towards the Marish<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and the River.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™Why, this is the Stock-brook!' said Pippin. 'If we are going to try<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and get back on to our course, we must cross at once and bear right.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They waded the stream, and hurried over a wide open space, rush-grown<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and treeless, on the further side. Beyond that they came again to a belt of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">trees: tall oaks, for the most part, with here and there an elm tree or an<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ash. The ground was fairly level, and there was little undergrowth; but the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">trees were loo close for them to see far ahead. The leaves blew upwards in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sudden gusts of wind, and spots of rain began to fall from the overcast sky.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Then the wind died away and the rain came streaming down. They trudged<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">along<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">as fast as they could, over patches of grass, and through thick drifts of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">old leaves; and all about them the rain pattered and trickled. They did not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">talk, but kept glancing back, and from side to side.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After half an hour Pippin said: 'I hope we have not turned too much<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">towards the south, and are not walking longwise through this wood! It is not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a very broad belt â€”I should have said no more than a mile at the widest -<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and we ought to have been through it by now.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'It is no good our starting to go in zig-zags,' said Frodo. 'That won't<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mend matters. Let us keep on as we are going! I am not sure that I want to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">come out into the open yet.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They went on for perhaps another couple of miles. Then the sun gleamed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">out of ragged clouds again and the rain lessened. It was now past mid-day,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and they felt it was high time for lunch. They halted under an elm tree: its<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">leaves though fast turning yellow were still thick, and the ground at its<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">feel was fairly dry and sheltered. When they came to make their meal, they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">found that the Elves had filled their bottles with a clear drink, pale<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">golden in colour: it had the scent of a honey made of many flowers, and was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wonderfully refreshing. Very soon they were laughing, and snapping their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fingers at rain, and at Black Riders. The last few miles, they felt, would<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">soon be behind them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo propped his back against the tree-trunk, and closed his eyes. Sam<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and Pippin sat near, and they began to hum, and then to sing softly:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Ho! Ho! Ho! to the bottle I go<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">To heal my heart and drown my woe.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Rain may fall and wind may blow,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And many miles be still to go,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But under a tall tree I will lie,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And let the clouds go sailing by.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Ho! Ho! Ho! they began again louder. They stopped short suddenly. Frodo<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sprang to his feet. A long-drawn wail came down the wind, like the cry of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">some evil and lonely creature. It rose and fell, and ended on a high<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">piercing note. Even as they sat and stood, as if suddenly frozen, it was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">answered by another cry, fainter and further off, but no less chilling to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the blood. There was then a silence, broken only by the sound of the wind in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the leaves.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'And what do you think that was?' Pippin asked at last, trying to speak<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">lightly, but quavering a little. 'If it was a bird, it was one that I never<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">heard in the Shire before.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'It was not bird or beast,' said Frodo. 'It was a call, or a signal â€”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">there were words in that cry, though I could not catch them. But no hobbit<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">has such a voice.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">No more was said about it. They were all thinking of the Riders, but no<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">one spoke of them. They were now reluctant either to stay or go on; but<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sooner or later they had got to get across the open country to the Ferry,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and it was best to go sooner and in daylight. In a few moments they had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shouldered their packs again and were off.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Before long the wood came to a sudden end. Wide grass-lands stretched<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">before them. They now saw that they had, in fact, turned too much to the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">south. Away over the flats they could glimpse the low hill of Bucklebury<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">across the River, but it was now to their left. Creeping cautiously out from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the edge of the trees, they set off across the open as quickly as they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">could.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At first they felt afraid, away from the shelter of the wood. Far back<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">behind them stood the high place where they had breakfasted. Frodo half<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">expected to see the small distant figure of a horseman on the ridge dark<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">against the sky; but there was no sign of one. The sun escaping from the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">breaking clouds, as it sank towards the hills they had left, was now shining<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">brightly again. Their fear left them, though they still felt uneasy. But the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">land became steadily more tame and well-ordered. Soon they came into<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">well-tended fields and meadows: there were hedges and gates and dikes for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">drainage. Everything seemed quiet and peaceful, just an ordinary corner of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Shire. Their spirits rose with every step. The line of the River grew<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">nearer; and the Black Riders began to seem like phantoms of the woods now<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">left far behind.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They passed along the edge of a huge turnip-field, and came to a stout<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">gate. Beyond it a rutted lane ran between low well-laid hedges towards a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">distant clump of trees. Pippin stopped.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I know these fields and this gate!' he said. 'This is Bamfurlong, old<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Farmer Maggot's land. That's his farm away there in the trees.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'One trouble after another!' said Frodo, looking nearly as much alarmed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">as if Pippin had declared the lane was the slot leading to a dragon's den.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The others looked at him in surprise.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'What's wrong with old Maggot?' asked Pippin. 'He's a good friend to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">all the Brandy bucks. Of course he's a terror to trespassers, and keeps<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ferocious dogs - but after all, folk down here are near the border and have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to be more on their guard.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I know,' said Frodo. 'But all the same,' he added with a shamefaced<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">laugh, 'I am terrified of him and his dogs. I have avoided his farm for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">years and years. He caught me several times trespassing after mushrooms,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">when I was a youngster at Brandy Hall. On the last occasion he beat me, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">then took me and showed me to his dogs. "See, lads," he said, "next time<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">this young varmint sets foot on my land, you can eat him. Now see him off!"<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They chased me all the way to the Ferry. I have never got over the fright -<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">though I daresay the beasts knew their business and would not really have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">touched me.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Pippin laughed. 'Well, it's time you made it up. Especially if you are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">coming back to live in Buckland. Old Maggot is really a stout fellow - if<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you leave his mushrooms alone. Fet's get into the lane and then we shan't be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">trespassing. If we meet him, I'll do the talking. He is a friend of Merry's,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and I used to come here with him a good deal at one time.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They went along the lane, until they saw the thatched roofs of a large<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">house and farm-buildings peeping out among the trees ahead. The Maggots,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Puddifoots of Stock, and most of the inhabitants of the Marish, were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">house-dwellers; and this farm was stoutly built of brick and had a high wall<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">all round it. There was a wide wooden gate opening out of the wall into the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">lane.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Suddenly as they drew nearer a terrific baying and barking broke out,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and a loud voice was heard shouting: â€™Grip! Fang! Wolf! Come on, lads!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo and Sam stopped dead, but Pippin walked on a few paces. The gate<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">opened and three huge dogs came pelting out into the lane, and dashed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">towards the travellers, barking fiercely. They took no notice of Pippin; but<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sam shrank against the wall, while two wolvish-looking dogs sniffed at him<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">suspiciously, and snarled if he moved. The largest and most ferocious of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">three halted in front of Frodo, bristling and growling.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Through the gate there now appeared a broad thick -set hobbit with a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">round red face. 'Hallo! Hallo! And who may you be, and what may you be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wanting?' he asked.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Good afternoon, Mr. Maggot!' said Pippin.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The farmer looked at him closely. 'Well, if it isn't Master Pippin -<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mr. Peregrin Took, I should say!' he cried, changing from a scowl to a grin.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'It's a long time since I saw you round here. It's lucky for you that I know<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you. I was just going out to set my dogs on any strangers. There are some<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">funny things going on today. Of course, we do get queer folk wandering in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">these parts at times. Too near the River,' he said, shaking his head. 'But<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">this fellow was the most outlandish I have ever set eyes on. He won't cross<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">my land without leave a second time, not if I can stop it.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'What fellow do you mean?' asked Pippin.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Then you haven't seen him?' said the farmer. 'He went up the lane<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">towards the causeway not a long while back. He was a funny customer and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">asking funny questions. But perhaps you'll come along inside, and we'll pass<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the news more comfortable. I've a drop of good ale on tap, if you and your<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">friends are willing, Mr. Took.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It seemed plain that the farmer would tell them more, if allowed to do<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it in his own time and fashion, so they all accepted the invitation. 'What<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">about the dogs?' asked Frodo anxiously.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The farmer laughed. 'They won't harm you - not unless I tell 'em to.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Here, Grip! Fang! Heel!' he cried. 'Heel, Wolf!' To the relief of Frodo and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sam, the dogs walked away and let them go free.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Pippin introduced the other two to the farmer. 'Mr. Frodo Baggins,' he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">said. 'You may not remember him, but he used to live at Brandy Hall.' At the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">name Baggins the farmer started, and gave Frodo a sharp glance. For a moment<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo thought that the memory of stolen mushrooms had been aroused, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the dogs would be told to see him off. But Farmer Maggot took him by the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">arm.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well, if that isn't queerer than ever?' he exclaimed. 'Mr. Baggins is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it? Come inside! We must have a talk.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They went into the farmer's kitchen, and sat by the wide fire-place.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mrs. Maggot brought out beer in a huge jug, and filled four large mugs. It<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was a good brew, and Pippin found himself more than compensated for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">missing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Golden Perch. Sam sipped his beer suspiciously. He had a natural<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mistrust of the inhabitants of other parts of the Shire; and also he was not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">disposed to be quick friends with anyone who had beaten his master, however<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">long ago.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After a few remarks about the weather and the agricultural prospects<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">(which were no worse than usual), Farmer Maggot put down his mug and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">looked<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">at them all in turn.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Now, Mr. Peregrin,' he said, 'where might you be coming from, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">where might you be going to? Were you coming to visit' me? For, if so, you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">had gone past my gate without my seeing you.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well, no,' answered Pippin. 'To tell you the truth, since you have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">guessed it, we got into the lane from the other end: we had come over your<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fields. But that was quite by accident. We lost our way in the woods, back<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">near Woodhall, trying to take a short cut to the Ferry.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'If you were in a hurry, the road would have served you better,' said<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the farmer. 'But I wasn't worrying about that. You have leave to walk over<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">my land, if you have a mind, Mr. Peregrin. And you, Mr. Baggins - though I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">daresay you still like mushrooms.' He laughed. 'Ah yes, I recognized the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">name. I recollect the time when young Frodo Baggins was one of the worst<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">young rascals of Buckland. But it wasn't mushrooms I was thinking of. I had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">just heard the name Baggins before you turned up. What do you think that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">funny customer asked me?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They waited anxiously for him to go on. 'Well,' the farmer continued,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">approaching his point with slow relish, 'he came riding on a big black horse<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in at the gate, which happened to be open, and right up to my door. All<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">black he was himself, too, and cloaked and hooded up, as if he did not want<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to be known. "Now what in the Shire can he want?" I thought to myself. We<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">don't see many of the Big Folk over the border; and anyway I had never heard<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of any like this black fellow.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">' "Good-day to you!" I says, going out to him. "This lane donâ€™t lead<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">anywhere, and wherever you may be going, your quickest way will be back to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the road." I didn't like the looks of him; and when Grip came out, he took<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">one sniff and let out a yelp as if he had been slung: he put down his tail<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and bolted off howling. The black fellow sat quite still.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">' "I come from yonder," he said, slow and stiff-like, pointing back<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">west, over my fields, if you please. "Have you seen Baggins? " he asked in a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">queer voice, and bent down towards me. I could not see any face, for his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hood fell down so low; and I felt a sort of shiver down my back. But I did<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">not see why he should come riding over my land so bold.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">' "Be off!" I said. "There are no Bagginses here. You're in the wrong<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">part of the Shire. You had better go back west to Hobbiton - but you can go<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">by road this time."<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">' "Baggins has left," he answered in a whisper. "He is coming. He is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">not far away. I wish to find him. If he passes will you tell me? I will come<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">back with gold."<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">' "No you won't," I said. "You'll go back where you belong, double<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">quick. I give you one minute before I call all my dogs."<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'He gave a sort of hiss. It might have been laughing, and it might not.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Then he spurred his great horse right at me, and I jumped out of the way<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">only just in time. I called the dogs, but he swung off, and rode through the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">gate and up the lane towards the causeway like a bolt of thunder. What do<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you think of that?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo sat for a moment looking at the fire, but his only thought was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">how on earth would they reach the Ferry. 'I don't know what to think,' he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">said at last.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Then I'll tell you what to think,' said Maggot. 'You should never have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">gone mixing yourself up with Hobbiton folk, Mr. Frodo. Folk are queer up<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">there.' Sam stirred in his chair, and looked at the farmer with an<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">unfriendly eye. 'But you were always a reckless lad. When I heard you had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">left the Brandybucks and gone off to that old Mr. Bilbo, I said that you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were going to find trouble. Mark my words, this all comes of those strange<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">doings of Mr. Bilbo's. His money was got in some strange fashion in foreign<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">parts, they say. Maybe there is some that want to know what has become of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the gold and jewels that he buried in the hill of Hobbiton, as I hear?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo said nothing: the shrewd guesses of the farmer were rather<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">disconcerting.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well, Mr. Frodo,' Maggot went on, 'I'm glad that you've had the sense<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to come back to Buckland. My advice is: stay there! And don't get mixed up<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with these outlandish folk. You'll have friends in these parts. If any of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">these black fellows come after you again, I'll deal with them. I'll say<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you're dead, or have left the Shire, or anything you like. And that might be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">true enough; for as like as not it is old Mr. Bilbo they want news of.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Maybe you're right,' said Frodo, avoiding the farmer's eye and staring<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">at the fire.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Maggot looked at him thoughtfully. 'Well, I see you have ideas of your<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">own,' he said. 'It is as plain as my nose that no accident brought you and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that rider here on the same afternoon; and maybe my news was no great news<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to you, after all. I am not asking you to tell me anything you have a mind<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to keep to yourself; but I see you are in some kind of trouble. Perhaps you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">are thinking it won't be too easy to get to the Ferry without being caught?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I was thinking so,' said Frodo. But we have got to try and get there;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and it won't be done by sitting and thinking. Sol am afraid we must be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">going. Thank you very much indeed for your kindness! I've been in terror of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you and your dogs for over thirty years, Farmer Maggot, though you may laugh<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to hear it. It's a pity: for I've missed a good friend. And now I'm sorry to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">leave so soon. But I'll come back, perhaps, one day - if I get a chance.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You'll be welcome when you come,' said Maggot. 'But now I've a notion.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It's near sundown already, and we are going to have our supper; for we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mostly go to bed soon after the Sun. If you and Mr. Peregrin and all could<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stay and have a bite with us, we would be pleased!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'And so should we!' said Frodo. 'But we must be going at once, I'm<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">afraid. Even now it will be dark before we can reach the Ferry.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Ah! but wait a minute! I was going to say: after a bit of supper, I'll<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">gel out a small waggon, and I'll drive you all to the Ferry. That will save<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you a good step, and it might also save you trouble of another sort.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo now accepted the invitation gratefully, to the relief of Pippin<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and Sam. The sun was already behind the western hills, and the light was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">failing. Two of Maggot's sons and his three daughters came in, and a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">generous supper was laid on the large table. The kitchen was lit with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">candles and the fire was mended. Mrs. Maggot hustled in and out. One or two<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">other hobbits belonging to the farm-household came in. In a short while<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fourteen sat down to eat. There was beer in plenty, and a mighty dish of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mushrooms and bacon, besides much other solid farmhouse fare. The dogs lay<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">by the fire and gnawed rinds and cracked bones.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">When they had finished, the farmer and his sons went out with a lantern<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and got the waggon ready. It was dark in the yard, when the guests came out.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They threw their packs on board and climbed in. The farmer sat in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">driving-seat, and whipped up his two stout ponies. His wife stood in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">light of the open door.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You be careful of yourself. Maggot!' she called. 'Don't go arguing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with any foreigners, and come straight back!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I will!' said he, and drove out of the gate. There was now no breath<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of wind stirring; the night was still and quiet, and a chill was in the air.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They went without lights and took it slowly. After a mile or two the lane<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">came to an end, crossing a deep dike, and climbing a short slope up on to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the high-banked causeway.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Maggot got down and took a good look either way, north and south, but<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">nothing could be seen in the darkness, and there was not a sound in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">still air. Thin strands of river -mist were hanging above the dikes, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">crawling over the fields.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'It's going to be thick,' said Maggot; 'but I'll not light my lantern<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">till I turn for home. We'll hear anything on the road long before we meet it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">tonight.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It was five miles or more from Maggot's lane to the Ferry. The hobbits<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wrapped themselves up, but their ears were strained for any sound above the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">creak of the wheels and the slow clop of the ponies' hoofs. The waggon<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">seemed slower than a snail to Frodo. Beside him Pippin was nodding towards<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sleep; but Sam was staring forwards into the rising fog.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They reached the entrance to the Ferry lane at last. It was marked by<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">two tall white posts that suddenly loomed up on their right. Farmer Maggot<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">drew in his ponies and the waggon creaked to a halt. They were just<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">beginning lo scramble out, when suddenly they heard what they had all been<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dreading: hoofs on the road ahead. The sound was coming towards them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Maggot jumped down and stood holding the ponies' heads, and peering<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">forward into the gloom. Clip-clop, clip-clop came the approaching rider. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fall of the hoofs sounded loud in the still, foggy air.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You'd better be hidden, Mr. Frodo,â€™ said Sam anxiously. 'You get down<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in the waggon and cover up with blankets, and we'll send this rider to the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">rightabouts!' He climbed out and went to the farmer's side. Black Riders<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">would have to ride over him to get near the waggon.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Clop-clop, clop-clop. The rider was nearly on them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Hallo there!' called Farmer Maggot. The advancing hoofs stopped short.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They thought they could dimly guess a dark cloaked shape in the mist, a yard<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">or two ahead. 'Now then!' said the farmer, throwing the reins to Sam and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">striding forward. 'Don't you come a step nearer! What do you want, and where<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">are you going?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I want Mr. Baggins. Have you seen him?' said a muffled voice - but the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">voice was the voice of Merry Brandybuck. A dark lantern was uncovered, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">its light fell on the astonished face of the farmer.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Mr. Merry!' he cried.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Yes, of course! Who did you think it was?' said Merry coming forward.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As he came out of the mist and their fears subsided, he seemed suddenly to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">diminish to ordinary hobbit-size. He was riding a pony, and a scarf was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">swathed round his neck and over his chin to keep out the fog.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo sprang out of the waggon to greet him. 'So there you are at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">last!' said Merry. 'I was beginning to wonder if you would turn up at all<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">today, and I was just going back to supper. When it grew foggy I came across<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and rode up towards Stock to see if you had fallen in any ditches. But I'm<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">blest if I know which way you have come. Where did you find them, Mr.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Maggot? In your duck-pond?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'No, I caught 'em trespassing,' said the farmer, 'and nearly set my<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dogs on 'em; but they'll tell you all the story, I've no doubt. Now, if<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you'll excuse me, Mr. Merry and Mr. Frodo and all, I'd best be turning for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">home. Mrs. Maggot will be worriting with the night getting thick.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He backed the waggon into the lane and turned it. 'Well, good night to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you all,' he said. 'It's been a queer day, and no mistake. But all's well as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ends well; though perhaps we should not say that until we reach our own<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">doors. I'll not deny that I'll be glad now when I do.' He lit his lanterns,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and got up. Suddenly he produced a large basket from under the seat. 'I was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">nearly forgetting,' he said. 'Mrs. Maggot put this up for Mr. Baggins, with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">her compliments.' He handed it down and moved off, followed by a chorus of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">thanks and good-nights.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They watched the pale rings of light round his lanterns as they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dwindled into the foggy night. Suddenly Frodo laughed: from the covered<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">basket he held, the scent of mushrooms was rising.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Now we had better get home ourselves,' said Merry. There's something<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">funny about all this, I see; but it must wait till we get in.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They turned down the Ferry lane, which was straight and well-kept and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">edged with large white- washed stones. In a hundred yards or so it brought<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">them to the river -bank, where there was a broad wooden landing-stage. A<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">large flat ferry-boat was moored beside it. The white bollards near the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">water's edge glimmered in the light of two lamps on high posts. Behind them<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the mists in the flat fields were now above the hedges; but the water before<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">them was dark, with only a few curling wisps like steam among the reeds by<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the bank. There seemed to be less fog on the further side.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Merry led the pony over a gangway on to the ferry, and the others<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">followed. Merry then pushed slowly off with a long pole. The Brandywine<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">flowed slow and broad before them. On the other side the bank was steep, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">up it a winding path climbed from the further landing. Lamps were twinkling<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">there. Behind loomed up the Buck Hill; and out of it, through stray shrouds<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of mist, shone many round windows, yellow and red. They were the windows<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Brandy Hall, the ancient home of the Brandy bucks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Long ago Gorhendad Oldbuck, head of the Oldbuck family, one of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">oldest in the Marish or indeed in the Shire, had crossed the river, which<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was the original boundary of the land eastwards. He built (and excavated)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Brandy Hall, changed his name to Brandybuck, and settled down to become<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">master of what was virtually a small independent country. His family grew<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and grew, and after his days continued to grow, until Brandy Hall occupied<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the whole of the low hill, and had three large front-doors, many side-doors,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and about a hundred windows. The Brandybucks and their numerous<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dependants<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">then began to burrow, and later to build, all round about. That was the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">origin of Buckland, a thickly inhabited strip between the river and the Old<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Forest, a sort of colony from the Shire. Its chief village was Bucklebury,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">clustering in the banks and slopes behind Brandy Hall.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The people in the Marish were friendly with the Bucklanders, and the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">authority of the Master of the Hall (as the head of the Brandybuck family<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was called) was still acknowledged by the farmers between Stock and Rushey.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But most of the folk of the old Shire regarded the Bucklanders as peculiar,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">half foreigners as it were. Though, as a matter of fact, they were not very<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">different from the other hobbits of the Four Farthings. Except in one point:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they were fond of boats, and some of them could swim.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Their land was originally unprotected from the East; but on that side<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they had built a hedge: the High Hay. It had been planted many generations<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ago, and was now thick and tail, for it was constantly tended. It ran all<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the way from Brandywine Bridge, in a big loop curving away from the river,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to Haysend (where the Withywindle flowed out of the Forest into the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Brandywine): well over twenty miles from end to end. But, of course, it was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">not a complete protection. The Forest drew close to the hedge in many<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">places. The Bucklanders kept their doors locked after dark, and that also<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was not usual in the Shire.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The ferry-boat moved slowly across the water. The Buckland shore drew<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">nearer. Sam was the only member of the party who had not been over the river<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">before. He had a strange feeling as the slow gurgling stream slipped by: his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">old life lay behind in the mists, dark adventure lay in front. He scratched<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his head, and for a moment had a passing wish that Mr. Frodo could have gone<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">on living quietly at Bag End.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The four hobbits stepped off the ferry. Merry was tying it up, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Pippin was already leading the pony up the path, when Sam (who had been<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">looking back, as if to take farewell of the Shire) said in a hoarse whisper:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Look back, Mr. Frodo! Do you see anything?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">On the far stage, under the distant lamps, they could just make out a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">figure: it looked like a dark black bundle left behind. But as they looked<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it seemed to move and sway this way and that, as if searching the ground. It<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">then crawled, or went crouching, back into the gloom beyond the lamps.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'What in the Shire is that?' exclaimed Merry.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Something that is following us,' said Frodo. 'But don't ask any more<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">now! Let's get away at once!' They hurried up the path to the top of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">bank, but when they looked back the far shore was shrouded in mist, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">nothing could be seen.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Thank goodness you don't keep any boats on the west -bank!' said Frodo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Can horses cross the river?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'They can go twenty miles north to Brandywine Bridge - or they might<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">swim,' answered Merry. 'Though I never heard of any horse swimming the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Brandywine. But what have horses to do with it?' I'll tell you later. Let's<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">get indoors and then we can talk.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'All right! You and Pippin know your way; so I'll just ride on and tell<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Fatty Bolger that you are coming. We'll see about supper and things.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'We had our supper early with Farmer Maggot,' said Frodo; 'but we could<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">do with another.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You shall have it! Give me that basket!' said Merry, and rode ahead<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">into the darkness.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It was some distance from the Brandywine to Frodo's new house at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Crickhollow. They passed Buck Hill and Brandy Hall on their left, and on the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">outskirts of Bucklebury struck the main road of Buckland that ran south from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Bridge. Half a mile northward along this they came to a lane opening on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">their right. This they followed for a couple of miles as it climbed up and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">down into the country.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At last they came to a narrow gate in a thick hedge. Nothing could be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">seen of the house in the dark: it stood back from the lane in the middle of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a wide circle of lawn surrounded by a belt of low trees inside the outer<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hedge. Frodo had chosen it, because it stood in an out-of-the-way corner of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the country, and there were no other dwellings close by. You could get in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and out without being noticed. It had been built a long while before by the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Brandybucks, for the use of guests, or members of the family that wished to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">escape from the crowded life of Brandy Hall for a time. It was an<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">old-fashioned countrified house, as much like a hobbit-hole as possible: it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was long and low, with no upper storey; and it had a roof of turf, round<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">windows, and a large round door.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As they walked lip the green path from the gate no light was visible;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the windows were dark and shuttered. Frodo knocked on the door, and Fatty<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bolger opened it. A friendly light streamed out. They slipped in quickly and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shut themselves and the light inside. They were in a wide hall with doors on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">either side; in front of them a passage ran back down the middle of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">house.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well, what do you think of it?' asked Merry coming up the passage. 'We<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">have done our best in a short time to make it look like home. After all<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Fatty and I only got here with the last cart-load yesterday.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo looked round. It did look like home. Many of his own favourite<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">things - or Bilbo's things (they reminded him sharply of him in their new<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">selling) - were arranged as nearly as possible as they had been at Bag End.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It was a pleasant, comfortable, welcoming place; and he found himself<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wishing that he was really coming here to settle down in quiet retirement.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It seemed unfair to have put his friends to all this trouble; and he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wondered again how he was going to break the news to them that he must leave<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">them so soon, indeed at once. Yet that would have to be done that very<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">night, before they all went to bed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'It's delightful!' he said with an effort. 'I hardly feel that I have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">moved at all.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The travellers hung up their cloaks, and piled their packs on the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">floor. Merry led them down the passage and threw open a door at the far end.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Firelight came out, and a puff of steam.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'A bath!' cried Pippin. 'O blessed Meriadoc!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Which order shall we go in?' said Frodo. 'Eldest first, or quickest<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">first? You'll be last either way, Master Peregrin.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Trust me to arrange things better than that!' said Merry. 'We can't<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">begin life at Crickhollow with a quarrel over baths. In that room there are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">three tubs, and a copper full of boiling water. There are also towels, mats<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and soap. Get inside, and be quick!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Merry and Fatty went into the kitchen on the other side of the passage,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and busied themselves with the final preparations for a late supper.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Snatches of competing songs came from the bathroom mixed with the sound<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">splashing and wallowing. The voice of Pippin was suddenly lifted up above<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the others in one of Bilbo's favourite bath-songs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sing hey! for the bath at close of day<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that washes the weary mud away!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A loon is he that will not sing:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">O! Water Hot is a noble thing!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">O! Sweet is the sound of falling rain,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and the brook that leaps from hill to plain;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">but better than rain or rippling streams<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">is Water Hot that smokes and steams.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">O! Water cold we may pour at need<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">down a thirsty throat and be glad indeed;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">but better is Beer, if drink we lack,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and Water Hot poured down the back.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">O! Water is fair that leaps on high<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in a fountain white beneath the sky;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">but never did fountain sound so sweet<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">as splashing Hot Water with my feet!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There was a terrific splash, and a shout of Whoa! from Frodo. It<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">appeared that a lot of Pippin's bath had imitated a fountain and leaped on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">high.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Merry went to the door: 'What about supper and beer in the throat?' he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">called. Frodo came out drying his hair.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'There's so much water in the air that I'm coming into the kitchen to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">finish,' he said.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Lawks!' said Merry, looking in. The stone floor was swimming. 'You<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ought to mop all that up before you get anything to eat. Peregrin,' he said.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Hurry up, or we shan't wait for you.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They had supper in the kitchen on a table near the fire. 'I suppose you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">three won't want mushrooms again?' said Fredegar without much hope.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Yes we shall!' cried Pippin.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'They're mine!' said Frodo. 'Given to me by Mrs. Maggot, a queen among<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">farmers' wives. Take your greedy hands away, and I'll serve them.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Hobbits have a passion for mushrooms, surpassing even the greediest<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">likings of Big People. A fact which partly explains young Frodo's long<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">expeditions to the renowned fields of the Marish, and the wrath of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">injured Maggot. On this occasion there was plenty for all, even according to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hobbit standards. There were also many other things to follow, and when they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">had finished even Fatty Bolger heaved a sigh of content. They pushed back<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the table, and drew chairs round the fire.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'We'll clear up later,' said Merry. 'Now tell me all about it! I guess<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that you have been having adventures, which was not quite fair without me. I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">want a full account; and most of all I want to know what was the matter with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">old Maggot, and why he spoke to me like that. He sounded almost as if he was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">scared, if that is possible.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'We have all been scared,' said Pippin after a pause, in which Frodo<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stared at the fire and did not speak. 'You would have been, too, if you had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">been chased for two days by Black Riders.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'And what are they?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Black figures riding on black horses,' answered Pippin. 'If Frodo<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">won't talk, I will tell you the whole tale from the beginning.' He then gave<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a full account of their journey from the time when they left Hobbiton. Sam<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">gave various supporting nods and exclamations. Frodo remained silent.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I should think you were making it all up,' said Merry, 'if I had not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">seen that black shape on the landing-stage - and heard the queer sound in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Maggot's voice. What do you make of it all, Frodo?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Cousin Frodo has been very close,' said Pippin. 'But the time has come<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">for him to open out. So far we have been given nothing more to go on than<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Farmer Maggot's guess that it has something to do with old Bilbo's<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">treasure.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'That was only a guess,' said Frodo hastily. 'Maggot does not know<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">anything.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Old Maggot is a shrewd fellow,' said Merry. 'A lot goes on behind his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">round face that does not come out in his talk. I've heard that he used to go<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">into the Old Forest at one time, and he has the reputation of knowing a good<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">many strange things. But you can at least tell us, Frodo, whether you think<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his guess good or bad.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I think, ' answered Frodo slowly, 'that it was a good guess, as far as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it goes. There is a connexion with Bilbo's old adventures, and the Riders<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">are looking, or perhaps one ought to say searching, for him or for me. I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">also fear, if you want to know, that it is no joke at all; and that I am not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">safe here or anywhere else.' He looked round at the windows and walls, as if<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he was afraid they would suddenly give way. The others looked at him in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">silence, and exchanged meaning glances among themselves.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'It's coming out in a minute,' whispered Pippin to Merry. Merry nodded.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well!' said Frodo at last, sitting up and straightening his back, as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">if he had made a decision. 'I can't keep it dark any longer. I have got<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">something to tell you all. But I don't know quite how to begin.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I think I could help you,' said Merry quietly, 'by telling you some of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it myself.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'What do you mean?' said Frodo, looking at him anxiously. 'Just this,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">my dear old Frodo: you are miserable, because you don't know how to say<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">good-bye. You meant to leave the Shire, of course. But danger has come on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you sooner than you expected, and now you are making up your mind to go at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">once. And you don't want to. We are very sorry for you.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo opened his mouth and shut it again. His look of surprise was so<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">comical that they laughed. 'Dear old Frodo!' said Pippin. 'Did you really<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">think you had thrown dust in all our eyes? You have not been nearly careful<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">or clever enough for that! You have obviously been planning to go and saying<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">farewell to all your haunts all this year since April. We have constantly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">heard you muttering: "Shall I ever look down into that valley again, I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wonder", and things like that. And pretending that you had come to the end<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of your money, and actually selling your beloved Bag End to those<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sackville-Bagginses! And all those close talks with Gandalf.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Good heavens!' said Frodo. 'I thought I had been both careful and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">clever. I don't know what Gandalf would say. Is all the Shire discussing my<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">departure then?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Oh no!' said Merry. 'Don't worry about that! The secret won't keep for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">long, of course; but at present it is, I think, only known to us<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">conspirators. After all, you must remember that we know you well, and are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">often with you. We can usually guess what you are thinking. I knew Bilbo,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">too. To tell you the truth, I had been watching you rather closely ever<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">since he left. I thought you would go after him sooner or later; indeed I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">expected you to go sooner, and lately we have been very anxious. We have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">been terrified that you might give us the slip, and go off suddenly, all on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">your own like he did. Ever since this spring we have kept our eyes open, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">done a good deal of planning on our own account. You are not going to escape<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">so easily!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'But I must go,' said Frodo. 'It cannot be helped, dear friends. It is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wretched for us all, but it is no use your trying to keep me. Since you have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">guessed so much, please help me and do not hinder me!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You do not understand!' said Pippin. 'You must go - and therefore we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">must, too. Merry and I are coming with you. Sam is an excellent fellow, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">would jump down a dragon's throat to save you, if he did not trip over his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">own feet; but you will need more than one companion in your dangerous<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">adventure.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'My dear and most beloved hobbits!' said Frodo deeply moved. 'But I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">could not allow it. I decided that long ago, too. You speak of danger, but<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you do not understand. This is no treasure-hunt, no there-and -back journey.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I am flying from deadly peril into deadly peril.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Of course we understand,' said Merry firmly. 'That is why we have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">decided to come. We know the Ring is no laughing -matter; but we are going to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">do our best to help you against the Enemy.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Ring!' said Frodo, now completely amazed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Yes, the Ring,' said Merry. 'My dear old hobbit, you don't allow for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the inquisitiveness of friends. I have known about the existence of the Ring<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">for years - before Bilbo went away, in fact; but since he obviously regarded<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it as secret, I kept the knowledge in my head, until we formed our<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">conspiracy. I did not know Bilbo, of course, as well as I know you; I was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">too young, and he was also more careful - but he was not careful enough. If<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you want to know how I first found out, I will tell you.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Go on!' said Frodo faintly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'It was the Sackville-Bagginses that were his downfall, as you might<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">expect. One day, a year before the Party, I happened to be walking along the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">road, when I saw Bilbo ahead. Suddenly in the distance the S.-B.s appeared,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">coming towards us. Bilbo slowed down, and then hey presto! he vanished. I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was so startled that I hardly had the wits to hide myself in a more ordinary<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fashion; but I got through the hedge and walked along the field inside. I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was peeping through into the road, after the S.-B.s had passed, and was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">looking straight at Bilbo when he suddenly reappeared. I caught a glint of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">gold as he put something back in his trouser -pocket.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'After that I kept my eyes open. In fact, I confess that I spied. But<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you must admit that it was very intriguing, and I was only in my teens. I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">must be the only one in the Shire, besides you Frodo, that has ever seen the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">old fellow's secret book.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You have read his book!' cried Frodo. 'Good heavens above! Is nothing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">safe?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Not too safe, I should say,' said Merry. 'But I have only had one<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">rapid glance, and that was difficult to get. He never left the book about. I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wonder what became of it. I should like another look. Have you got it,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'No. It was not at Bag End. He must have taken it away.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well, as I was saying,' Merry proceeded, 'I kept my knowledge to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">myself, till this Spring when things got serious. Then we formed our<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">conspiracy; and as we were serious, too, and meant business, we have not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">been too scrupulous. You are not a very easy nut to crack, and Gandalf is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">worse. But if you want to be introduced to our chief investigator, I can<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">produce him.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Where is he?' said Frodo, looking round, as if he expected a masked<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and sinister figure to come out of a cupboard.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™Step forward, Sam!' said Merry; and Sam stood up with a face scarlet<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">up to the ears. 'Here's our collector of information ! And he collected a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">lot, I can tell you, before he was finally caught. After which, I may say,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he seemed to regard himself as on parole, and dried up.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Sam!' cried Frodo, feeling that amazement could go no further, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">quite unable to decide whether he felt angry, amused, relieved, or merely<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">foolish.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Yes, sir!' said Sam. 'Begging your pardon, sir! But I meant no wrong<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to you, Mr. Frodo, nor to Mr. Gandalf for that matter. He has some sense,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mind you; and when you said go alone, he said no! lake someone as you can<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">trust. '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'But it does not seem that I can trust anyone,' said Frodo. Sam looked<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">at him unhappily. 'It all depends on what you want,' put in Merry. 'You can<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">trust us to stick to you through thick and thin - to the bitter end. And you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">can trust us to keep any secret of yours - closer than you keep it yourself.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But you cannot trust us to let you face trouble alone, and go off without a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">word. We are your friends, Frodo. Anyway: there it is. We know most of what<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gandalf has told you. We know a good deal about the Ring. We are horribly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">afraid - but we are coming with you; or following you like hounds.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'And after all, sir,' added Sam, 'you did ought to take the Elves'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">advice. Gildor said you should take them as was willing, and you can't deny<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I don't deny it,' said Frodo, looking at Sam, who was now grinning. 'I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">don't deny it, but I'll never believe you are sleeping again, whether you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">snore or not. I shall kick you hard to make sure.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You are a set of deceitful scoundrels!' he said, turning to the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">others. 'But bless you!' he laughed, getting up and waving his arms, 'I give<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in. I will take Gildor's advice. If the danger were not so dark, I should<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dance for joy. Even so, I cannot help feeling happy; happier than I have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">felt for a long time. I had dreaded this evening.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Good! That's settled. Three cheers for Captain Frodo and company!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they shouted; and they danced round him. Merry and Pippin began a song,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">which they had apparently got ready for the occasion.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It was made on the model of the dwarf-song that started Bilbo on his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">adventure long ago, and went to the same tune:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Farewell we call to hearth and hall!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Though wind may blow and rain may fall,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">We must away ere break of day<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Far over wood and mountain tall.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">To Rivendell, where Elves yet dwell<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In glades beneath the misty fell,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Through moor and waste we ride in haste,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And whither then we cannot tell.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">With foes ahead, behind us dread,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Beneath the sky shall be our bed,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Until at last our toil be passed,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Our journey done, our errand sped.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">We must away! We must away!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">We ride before the break of day!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Very good!' said Frodo. 'But in that case there are a lot of things to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">do before we go to bed - under a roof, for tonight at any rate.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Oh! That was poetry!' said Pippin. 'Do you really mean to start before<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the break of day?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I don't know,' answered Frodo. 'I fear those Black Riders, and I am<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sure it is unsafe to stay in one place long, especially in a place to which<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it is known I was going. Also Gildor advised me not to wait. But I should<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">very much like to see Gandalf. I could see that even Gildor was disturbed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">when he heard that Gandalf had never appeared. It really depends on two<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">things. Flow soon could the Riders get to Bucklebury? And how soon could<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">get off? It will take a good deal of preparation.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'The answer to the second question,' said Merry, 'is that we could get<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">off in an hour. I have prepared practically everything. There are six ponies<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in a stable across the fields; stores and tackle are all packed, except for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a few extra clothes, and the perishable food.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'It seems to have been a very efficient conspiracy,' said Frodo. 'But<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">what about the Black Riders? Would it be safe to wait one day for Gandalf?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'That all depends on what you think the Riders would do, if they found<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you here,' answered Merry. 'They could have reached here by now, of course,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">if they were not stopped at the North-gate, where the Hedge runs down to the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">river -bank, just this side of the Bridge. The gate-guards would not let them<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">through by night, though they might break through. Even in the daylight they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">would try to keep them out, I think, at any rate until they got a message<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">through to the Master of the Hall - for they would not like the look of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Riders, and would certainly be frightened by them. But, of course, Buckland<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">cannot resist a determined attack for long. And it is possible that in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">morning even a Black Rider that rode up and asked for Mr. Baggins would be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">let through. It is pretty generally known that you are coming back to live<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">at Crickhollow.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo sat for a while in thought. 'I have made up my mind,' he said<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">finally. 'I am starting tomorrow, as soon as it is light. But I am not going<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">by road: it would be safer to wait here than that. If I go through the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">North-gate my departure from Buckland will be known at once, instead of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">being secret for several days at least, as it might be. And what is more,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Bridge and the East Road near the borders will certainly be watched,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">whether any Rider gets into Buckland or not. We don't know how many there<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">are; but there are at least two, and possibly more. The only thing to do is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to go off in a quite unexpected direction.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'But that can only mean going into the Old Forest!' said Fredegar<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">horrified. 'You can't be thinking of doing that. It is quite as dangerous as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Black Riders.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Not quite,' said Merry. It sounds very desperate, but I believe Frodo<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">is right. It is the only way of getting off without being followed at once.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">With luck we might gel a considerable start.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'But you won't have any luck in the Old Forest,' objected Fredegar. 'No<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">one ever has luck in there. You'll gel lost. People don't go in there.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Oh yes they do!' said Merry. 'The Brandybucks go in - occasionally<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">when the fit takes them. We have a private entrance. Frodo went in once,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">long ago. I have been in several times: usually in daylight, of course, when<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the trees are sleepy and fairly quiet.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well, do as you think best!' said Fredegar. 'I am more afraid of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Old Forest than of anything I know about: the stories about it are a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">nightmare; but my vote hardly counts, as I am not going on the journey.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Still, I am very glad someone is stopping behind, who can tell Gandalf what<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you have done, when he turns up, as I am sure he will before long.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Fond as he was of Frodo, Fatty Bolger had no desire to leave the Shire,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">nor to see what lay outside it. His family came from the Eastfarthing, from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Budgeford in Bridgefields in fact, but he had never been over the Brandywine<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bridge. His task, according to the original plans of the conspirators, was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to stay behind and deal with inquisitive folk, and to keep up as long as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">possible the pretence that Mr. Baggins was still living at Crickhollow. He<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">had even brought along some old clothes of Frodo's to help him in playing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the part. They little thought how dangerous that part might prove.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Excellent!' said Frodo, when he understood the plan. â€™We could not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">have left any message behind for Gandalf otherwise. I don't know whether<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">these Riders can read or not, of course, but I should not have dared to risk<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a written message, in case they got in and searched the house. But if Fatty<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">is willing to hold the fort, and I can be sure of Gandalf knowing the way we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">have gone, that decides me. I am going into the Old Forest first thing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">tomorrow.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well, that's that,' said Pippin. 'On the whole I would rather have our<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">job than Fatty's - waiting here till Black Riders come.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You wait till you are well inside the Forest,' said Fredegar. 'You'll<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wish you were back here with me before this time tomorrow.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'It's no good arguing about it any more,' said Merry. 'We have still<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">got to tidy up and put the finishing touches to the packing, before we get<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to bed. I shall call you all before the break of day.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">When at last he had got to bed, Frodo could not sleep for some time.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">His legs ached. He. was glad that he was riding in the morning. Eventually<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he fell into a vague dream, in which he seemed to be looking out of a high<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">window over a dark sea of tangled trees. Down below among the roots there<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was the sound of creatures crawling and snuffling. He felt sure they would<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">smell him out sooner or later.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Then he heard a noise in the distance. At first he thought it was a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">great wind coming over the leaves of the forest. Then he knew that it was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">not leaves, but the sound of the Sea far-off; a sound he had never heard in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">waking life, though it had often troubled his dreams. Suddenly he found he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was out in the open. There were no trees after all. He was on a dark heath,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and there was a strange salt smell in the air. Looking up he saw before him<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a tall white tower, standing alone on a high ridge. A great desire came over<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">him to climb the tower and see the Sea. He started to struggle up the ridge<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">towards the tower: but suddenly a light came in the sky, and there was a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">noise of thunder.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo woke suddenly. It was still dark in the room. Merry was standing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">there with a candle in one hand, and banging on the door with the other.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'All right! What is it?' said Frodo, still shaken and bewildered.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'What is it!' cried Merry. 'It is time to get up. It is half past four<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and very foggy. Come on! Sam is already getting breakfast ready. Even Pippin<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">is up. I am just going to saddle the ponies, and fetch the one that is to be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the baggage-carrier. Wake that sluggard Fatty! At least he must get up and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">see us off.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Soon after six o'clock the five hobbits were ready to start. Fatty<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bolger was still yawning. They stole quietly out of the house. Merry went in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">front leading a laden pony, and took his way along a path that went through<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a spinney behind the house, and then cut across several fields. The leaves<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of trees were glistening, and every twig was dripping; the grass was grey<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with cold dew. Everything was still, and far-away noises seemed near and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">clear: fowls chattering in a yard, someone closing a door of a distant<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">house.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In their shed they found the ponies; sturdy little beasts of the kind<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">loved by hobbits, not speedy, but good for a long day's work. They mounted,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and soon they were riding off into the mist, which seemed to open<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">reluctantly before them and close forbiddingly behind them. After riding for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">about an hour, slowly and without talking, they saw the Fledge looming<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">suddenly ahead. It was tall and netted over with silver cobwebs. 'How are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you going to get through this?' asked Fredegar. 'Follow me!' said Merry,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'and you will see.' He turned to the left along the Hedge, and soon they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">came to a point where it bent inwards, running along the lip of a hollow. A<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">cutting had been made, at some distance from the Hedge, and went sloping<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">gently down into the ground. It had walls of brick at the sides, which rose<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">steadily, until suddenly they arched over and formed a tunnel that dived<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">deep under the Hedge and came out in the hollow on the other side.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Here Fatty Bolger halted. 'Good-bye, Frodo!' he said. 'I wish you were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">not going into the Forest. I only hope you will not need rescuing before the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">day is out. But good luck to you - today and every day!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'If there are no worse things ahead than the Old Forest, I shall be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">lucky,' said Frodo. 'Tell Gandalf to hurry along the East Road: we shall<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">soon be back on it and going as fast as we can.â€™ â€™Good-bye!' they cried, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">rode down the slope and disappeared from Fredegar's sight into the tunnel.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It was dark and damp. At the far end it was closed by a gate of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">thick-set iron bars. Merry got down and unlocked the gate, and when they had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">all passed through he pushed it to again. It shut with a clang, and the lock<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">clicked. The sound was ominous.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™There!â€™ said Merry. 'You have left the Shire, and are now outside, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">on the edge of the Old Forest.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Are the stories about it true?' asked Pippin.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I don't know what stories you mean,' Merry answered. 'If you mean the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">old bogey-stories Fatty's nurses used to tell him, about goblins and wolves<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and things of that sort, I should say no. At any rate I don't believe them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But the Forest is queer. Everything in it is very much more alive, more<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">aware of what is going on, so to speak, than things are in the Shire. And<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the trees do not like strangers. They watch you. They are usually content<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">merely to watch you, as long as daylight lasts, and don't do much.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Occasionally the most unfriendly ones may drop a branch, or stick a root<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">out, or grasp at you with a long trailer. But at night things can be most<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">alarming, or so I am told. I have only once or twice been in here after<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dark, and then only near the hedge. I thought all the trees were whispering<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to each other, passing news and plots along in an unintelligible language;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and the branches swayed and groped without any wind. They do say the trees<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">do actually move, and can surround strangers and hem them in. In fact long<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ago they attacked the Hedge: they came and planted themselves right by it,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and leaned over it. But the hobbits came and cut down hundreds of trees, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">made a great bonfire in the Forest, and burned all the ground in a long<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">strip east of the Hedge. After that the trees gave up the attack, but they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">became very unfriendly. There is still a wide bare space not far inside<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">where the bonfire was made.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Is it only the trees that are dangerous?' asked Pippin.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'There are various queer things living deep in the Forest, and on the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">far side,' said Merry, 'or at least I have heard so; but I have never seen<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">any of them. But something makes paths. Whenever one comes inside one<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">finds<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">open tracks; but they seem to shift and change from time to time in a queer<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fashion. Not far from this tunnel there is, or was for a long time, the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">beginning of quite a broad path leading to the Bonfire Glade, and then on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">more or less in our direction, east and a little north. That is the path I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">am going to try and find.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The hobbits now left the tunnel-gate and rode across the wide hollow.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">On the far side was a faint path leading up on to the floor of the Forest, a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hundred yards and more beyond the Hedge; but it vanished as soon as it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">brought them under the trees. Looking back they could see the dark line of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Hedge through the stems of trees that were already thick about them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Looking ahead they could see only tree-trunks of innumerable sizes and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shapes: straight or bent, twisted, leaning, squat or slender, smooth or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">gnarled and branched; and all the stems were green or grey with moss and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">slimy, shaggy growths.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Merry alone seemed fairly cheerful. 'You had better lead on and find<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that path,' Frodo said to him. 'Don't let us lose one another, or forget<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">which way the Hedge lies!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They picked a way among the trees, and their ponies plodded along,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">carefully avoiding the many writhing and interlacing roots. There was no<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">undergrowth. The ground was rising steadily, and as they went forward it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">seemed that the trees became taller, darker, and thicker. There was no<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sound, except an occasional drip of moisture falling through the still<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">leaves. For the moment there was no whispering or movement among the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">branches; but they all got an uncomfortable feeling that they were being<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">watched with disapproval, deepening to dislike and even enmity. The feeling<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">steadily grew, until they found themselves looking up quickly, or glancing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">back over their shoulders, as if they expected a sudden blow.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There was not as yet any sign of a path, and the trees seemed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">constantly to bar their way. Pippin suddenly felt that he could not bear it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">any longer, and without warning let out a shout. 'Oi! Oi !' he cried. 'I am<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">not going to do anything. Just let me pass through, will you!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The others halted startled; but the cry fell as if muffled by a heavy<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">curtain. There was no echo or answer though the wood seemed to become<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">more<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">crowded and more watchful than before.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I should not shout, if I were you,' said Merry. It does more harm than<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">good.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo began to wonder if it were possible to find a way through, and if<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he had been right to make the others come into this abominable wood. Merry<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was looking from side to side, and seemed already uncertain which way to go.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Pippin noticed it. 'It has not taken you long to lose us,' he said. But at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that moment Merry gave a whistle of relief and pointed ahead.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well, well!' he said. 'These trees do shift. There is the Bonfire<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Glade in front of us (or I hope so), but the path to it seems to have moved<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">away!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The light grew clearer as they went forward. Suddenly they came out of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the trees and found themselves in a wide circular space. There was sky above<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">them, blue and clear to their surprise, for down under the Forest -roof they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">had not been able to see the rising morning and the lifting of the mist. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sun was not, however, high enough yet to shine down into the clearing,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">though its light was on the tree-tops. The leaves were all thicker and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">greener about the edges of the glade, enclosing it with an almost solid<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wall. No tree grew there, only rough grass and many tall plants: stalky and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">faded hemlocks and wood-parsley, fire-weed seeding into fluffy ashes, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">rampant nettles and thistles. A dreary place: but it seemed a charming and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">cheerful garden after the close Forest.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The hobbits felt encouraged, and looked up hopefully at the broadening<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">daylight in the sky. At the far side of the glade there was a break in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wall of trees, and a clear path beyond it. They could see it running on into<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the wood, wide in places and open above, though every now and again the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">trees drew in and overshadowed it with their dark boughs. Up this path they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">rode. They were still climbing gently, but they now went much quicker, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with better heart; for it seemed to them that the Forest had relented, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was going to let them pass unhindered after all.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But after a while the air began to get hot and stuffy. The trees drew<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">close again on either side, and they could no longer see far ahead. Now<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stronger than ever they felt again the ill will of the wood pressing on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">them. So silent was it that the fall of their ponies' hoofs, rustling on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dead leaves and occasionally stumbling on hidden roots, seemed to thud in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">their ears. Frodo tried to sing a song to encourage them, but his voice sank<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to a murmur.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">O! Wanderers in the shadowed land<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">despair not! For though dark they stand,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">all woods there be must end at last,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and see the open sun go past:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the setting sun, the rising sun,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the day's end, or the day begun.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For east or west all woods must fail...<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Fail - even as he said the word his voice faded into silence. The air<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">seemed heavy and the making of words wearisome. Just behind them a large<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">branch fell from an old overhanging tree with a crash into the path. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">trees seemed to close in before them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They do not like all that about ending and failing,' said Merry. 'I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">should not sing any more at present. Wait till we do get to the edge, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">then we'll turn and give them a rousing chorus!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He spoke cheerfully, and if he felt any great anxiety, he did not show<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it. The others did not answer. They were depressed. A heavy weight was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">settling steadily on Frodo's heart, and he regretted now with every step<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">forward that he had ever thought of challenging the menace of the trees. He<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was, indeed, just about to stop and propose going back (if that was still<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">possible), when things took a new turn. The path stopped climbing, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">became for a while nearly level. The dark trees drew aside, and ahead they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">could see the path going almost straight forward. Before them, but some<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">distance off, there stood a green hill-top, treeless, rising like a bald<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">head out of the encircling wood. The path seemed to be making directly for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They now hurried forward again, delighted with the thought of climbing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">out for a while above the roof of the Forest. The path dipped, and then<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">again began to climb upwards, leading them at last to the foot of the steep<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hillside. There it left the trees and faded into the turf. The wood stood<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">all round the hill like thick hair that ended sharply in a circle round a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shaven crown.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The hobbits led their ponies up, winding round and round until they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">reached the top. There they stood and gazed about them. The air was gleaming<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and sunlit, but hazy; and they could not see to any great distance. Near at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hand the mist was now almost gone; though here and there it lay in hollows<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of the wood, and to the south of them, out of a deep fold cutting right<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">across the Forest, the fog still rose like steam or wisps of white smoke.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'That,' said Merry, pointing with his hand, 'that is the line of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Withywindle. It comes down out of the Downs and flows south-west through<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">midst of the Forest to join the Brandywine below Haysend. We don't want to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">go that way! The Withywindle valley is said to be the queerest part of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">whole wood - the centre from which all the queerness comes, as it were.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The others looked in the direction that Merry pointed out, but they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">could see little but mists over the damp and deep-cut valley; and beyond it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the southern half of the Forest faded from view.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The sun on the hill-lop was now getting hot. It must have been about<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">eleven o'clock; but the autumn haze still prevented them from seeing much in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">other directions. In the west they could not make out either the line of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Hedge or the valley of the Brandywine beyond it. Northward, where they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">looked most hopefully, they could see nothing that might be the line of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">great East Road, for which they were making. They were on an island in a sea<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of trees, and the horizon was veiled.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">On the south-eastern side the ground fell very steeply, as if the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">slopes of the hill were continued far down under the trees, like<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">island-shores that really are the sides of a mountain rising out of deep<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">waters. They sat on the green edge and looked out over the woods below them,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">while they ate their mid-day meal. As the sun rose and passed noon they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">glimpsed far off in the east the grey-green lines of the Downs that lay<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">beyond the Old Forest on that side. That cheered them greatly; for it was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">good to see a sight of anything beyond the wood's borders, though they did<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">not mean to go that way, if they could help it: the Barrow-downs had as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sinister a reputation in hobbit-legend as the Forest itself.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At length they made up their minds to go on again. The path that had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">brought them to the hill reappeared on the northward side; but they had not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">followed it far before they became aware that it was bending steadily to the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">right. Soon it began to descend rapidly and they guessed that it must<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">actually be heading towards the Withy windle valley: not at all the direction<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they wished lo take. After some discussion they decided to leave this<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">misleading path and strike northward; for although they had not been able to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">see it from the hill-top, the Road must lie that way, and it could not be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">many miles off. Also northward, and to the left of the path, the land seemed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">lo be drier and more open, climbing up to slopes where the trees were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">thinner, and pines and firs replaced the oaks and ashes and other strange<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and nameless trees of the denser wood.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At first their choice seemed to be good: they got along at a fair<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">speed, though whenever they got a glimpse of the sun in an open glade they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">seemed unaccountably to have veered eastwards. But after a time the trees<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">began to close in again, just where they had appeared from a distance to be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">thinner and less tangled. Then deep folds in the ground were discovered<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">unexpectedly, like the ruts of great giant-wheels or wide moats and sunken<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">roads long disused and choked with brambles. These lay usually right across<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">their line of march, and could only be crossed by scrambling down and out<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">again, which was troublesome and difficult with their ponies. Each time they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">climbed down they found the hollow filled with thick bushes and matted<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">undergrowth, which somehow would not yield to the left, but only gave way<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">when they turned to the right; and they had to go some distance along the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">bottom before they could find a way up the further bank. Each time they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">clambered out, the trees seemed deeper and darker; and always to the left<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and upwards it was most difficult to find a way, and they were forced to the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">right and downwards.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After an hour or two they had lost all clear sense of direction, though<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they knew well enough that they had long ceased to go northward at all. They<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were being headed off, and were simply following a course chosen for them -<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">eastwards and southwards, into the heart of the Forest and not out of it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The afternoon was wearing away when they scrambled and stumbled into a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fold that was wider and deeper than any they had yet met. It was so sleep<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and overhung that it proved impossible to climb out of it again, either<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">forwards or backwards, without leaving their ponies and their baggage<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">behind. All they could do was to follow the fold - downwards. The ground<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">grew soft, and in places boggy; springs appeared in the banks, and soon they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">found themselves following a brook that trickled and babbled through a weedy<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">bed. Then the ground began to fall rapidly, and the brook growing strong and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">noisy, flowed and leaped swiftly downhill. They were in a deep dim-lit gully<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">over-arched by trees high above them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After stumbling along for some way along the stream, they came quite<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">suddenly out of the gloom. As if through a gate they saw the sunlight before<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">them. Coming to the opening they found that they had made their way down<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">through a cleft in a high sleep bank, almost a cliff. At its feet was a wide<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">space of grass and reeds; and in the distance could be glimpsed another bank<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">almost as steep. A golden afternoon of late sunshine lay warm and drowsy<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">upon the hidden land between. In the midst of it there wound lazily a dark<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">river of brown water, bordered with ancient willows, arched over with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">willows, blocked with fallen willows, and flecked with thousands of faded<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">willow-leaves. The air was thick with them, fluttering yellow from the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">branches; for there was a warm and gentle breeze blowing softly in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">valley, and the reeds were rustling, and the willow-boughs were creaking.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well, now I have at least some notion of where we are!' said Merry.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'We have come almost in the opposite direction to which we intended. This is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the River Withy windle! I will go on and explore.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He passed out into the sunshine and disappeared into the long grasses.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After a while he reappeared, and reported that there was fairly solid ground<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">between the cliff-foot and the river; in some places firm turf went down to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the water's edge. 'What's more,' he said, 'there seems to be something like<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a footpath winding along on this side of the river. If we turn left and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">follow it, we shall be bound to come out on the east side of the Forest<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">eventually.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I dare say!' said Pippin. 'That is, if the track goes on so far, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">does not simply lead us into a bog and leave us there. Who made the track,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">do you suppose, and why? I am sure it was not for our benefit. I am getting<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">very suspicious of this Forest and everything in it, and I begin to believe<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">all the stories about it. And have you any idea how far eastward we should<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">have to go?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'No,' said Merry, 'I haven't. I don't know in the least how far down<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Withywindle we are, or who could possibly come here often enough to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">make<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a path along it. But there is no other way out that I can see or think of.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There being nothing else for it, they filed out, and Merry led them to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the path that he had discovered. Everywhere the reeds and grasses were lush<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and tall, in places far above their heads; but once found, the path was easy<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to follow, as it turned and twisted, picking out the sounder ground among<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the bogs and pools. Here and there it passed over other rills, running down<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">gullies into the Withywindle out of the higher forest-lands, and at these<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">points there were tree-trunks or bundles of brushwood laid carefully across.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The hobbits began to feel very hot. There were armies of flies of all<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">kinds buzzing round their ears, and the afternoon sun was burning on their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">backs. At last they came suddenly into a thin shade; great grey branches<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">reached across the path. Each step forward became more reluctant than the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">last. Sleepiness seemed to be creeping out of the ground and up their legs,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and falling softly out of the air upon their heads and eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo felt his chin go down and his head nod. Just in front of him<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Pippin fell forward on to his knees. Frodo halted. 'It's no good,' he heard<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Merry saying. 'Can't go another step without rest. Must have nap. It's cool<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">under the willows. Less flies!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo did not like the sound of this. 'Come on!' he cried. 'We can't<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">have a nap yet. We must get clear of the Forest first.' But the others were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">too far gone to care. Beside them Sam stood yawning and blinking stupidly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Suddenly Frodo himself felt sleep overwhelming him. His head swam.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There now seemed hardly a sound in the air. The flies had stopped buzzing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Only a gentle noise on the edge of hearing, a soft fluttering as of a song<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">half whispered, seemed to stir in the boughs above. He lifted his heavy eyes<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and saw leaning over him a huge willow-tree, old and hoary. Enormous it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">looked, its sprawling branches going up like reaching arms with many<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">long-fingered hands, its knotted and twisted trunk gaping in wide fissures<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that creaked faintly as the boughs moved. The leaves fluttering against the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">bright sky dazzled him, and he toppled over, lying where he fell upon the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">grass.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Merry and Pippin dragged themselves forward and lay down with their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">backs to the willow-trunk. Behind them the great cracks gaped wide to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">receive them as the tree swayed and creaked. They looked up at the grey and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">yellow leaves, moving softly against the light, and singing. They shut their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">eyes, and then it seemed that they could almost hear words, cool words,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">saying something about water and sleep. They gave themselves up to the spell<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and fell fast asleep at the foot of the great grey willow.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo lay for a while fighting with the sleep that was overpowering<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">him; then with an effort he struggled to his feel again. He felt a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">compelling desire for cool water. 'Wait for me, Sam,' he stammered. 'Must<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">bathe feet a minute.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Half in a dream he wandered forward to the riverward side of the tree,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">where great winding roots grew out into the stream, like gnarled dragonets<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">straining down to drink. He straddled one of these, and paddled his hot feel<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in the cool brown water; and there he too suddenly fell asleep with his back<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">against the tree.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sam sat down and scratched his head, and yawned like a cavern. He was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">worried. The afternoon was getting late, and he thought this sudden<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sleepiness uncanny. 'There's more behind this than sun and warm air,' he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">muttered to himself. 'I don't like this great big tree. I don't trust it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Hark at it singing about sleep now! This won't do at all!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He pulled himself to his feet, and staggered off to see what had become<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of the ponies. He found that two had wandered on a good way along the path;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and he had just caught them and brought them back towards the others, when<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he heard two noises; one loud, and the other soft but very clear. One was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the splash of something heavy falling into the water; the other was a noise<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">like the snick of a lock when a door quietly closes fast.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He rushed back to the bank. Frodo was in the water close to the edge,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and a great tree-root seemed to be over him and holding him down, but he was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">not struggling. Sam gripped him by the jacket, and dragged him from under<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the root; and then with difficulty hauled him on to the bank. Almost at once<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he woke, and coughed and spluttered.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Do you know, Sam,' he said at length, 'the beastly tree threw me in! I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">felt it. The big root just twisted round and tipped me in!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You were dreaming I expect, Mr. Frodo,' said Sam. 'You shouldn't sit<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in such a place, if you feel sleepy.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'What about the others?' Frodo asked. 'I wonder what sort of dreams<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they are having.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They went round to the other side of the tree, and then Sam understood<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the click that he had heard. Pippin had vanished. The crack by which he had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">laid himself had closed together, so that not a chink could be seen. Merry<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was trapped: another crack had closed about his waist; his legs lay outside,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">but the rest of him was inside a dark opening, the edges of which gripped<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">like a pair of pincers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo and Sam beat first upon the tree-trunk where Pippin had lain.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They then struggled frantically to pull open the jaws of the crack that held<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">poor Merry. It was quite useless.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'What a foul thing to happen!' cried Frodo wildly. 'Why did we ever<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">come into this dreadful Forest? I wish we were all back at Crickhollow!' He<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">kicked the tree with all his strength, heedless of his own feet. A hardly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">perceptible shiver ran through the stem and up into the branches; the leaves<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">rustled and whispered, but with a sound now of faint and far-off laughter.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I suppose we haven't got an axe among our luggage, Mr. Frodo?' asked<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sam.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I brought a little hatchet for chopping firewood,' said Frodo. 'That<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wouldn't be much use.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Wait a minute!' cried Sam, struck by an idea suggested by firewood.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'We might do something with fire!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'We might,' said Frodo doubtfully. 'We might succeed in roasting Pippin<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">alive inside.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'We might try to hurt or frighten this tree to begin with,' said Sam<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fiercely. 'If it don't let them go, I'll have it down, if I have to gnaw<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it.' He ran to the ponies and before long came back with two tinder-boxes<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and a hatchet.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Quickly they gathered dry grass and leaves, and bits of bark; and made<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a pile of broken twigs and chopped sticks. These they heaped against the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">trunk on the far side of the tree from the prisoners. As soon as Sam had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">struck a spark into the tinder, it kindled the dry grass and a flurry of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">flame and smoke went up. The twigs crackled. Little fingers of fire licked<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">against the dry scored rind of the ancient tree and scorched it. A tremor<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ran through the whole willow. The leaves seemed to hiss above their heads<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with a sound of pain and anger. A loud scream came from Merry, and from far<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">inside the tree they heard Pippin give a muffled yell.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Put it out! Put it out!' cried Merry. 'He'll squeeze me in two, if you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">don't. He says so!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Who? What?' shouted Frodo, rushing round to the other side of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">tree.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Put it out! Put it out!' begged Merry. The branches of the willow<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">began to sway violently. There was a sound as of a wind rising and spreading<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">outwards to the branches of all the other trees round about, as though they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">had dropped a stone into the quiet slumber of the river -valley and set up<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ripples of anger that ran out over the whole Forest. Sam kicked at the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">little fire and stamped out the sparks. But Frodo, without any clear idea of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">why he did so, or what he hoped for, ran along the path crying help! help!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">help! It seemed to him that he could hardly hear the sound of his own shrill<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">voice: it was blown away from him by the willow-wind and drowned in a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">clamour of leaves, as soon as the words left his mouth. He felt desperate:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">lost and witless.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Suddenly he slopped. There was an answer, or so he thought; but it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">seemed to come from behind him, away down the path further back in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Forest. He turned round and listened, and soon there could be no doubt:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">someone was singing a song; a deep glad voice was singing carelessly and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">happily, but it was singing nonsense:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Hey dol! merry dol! ring a dong dillo!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Ring a dong! hop along! fal lal the willow!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Tom Bom, jolly Tom, Tom Bombadillo!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Half hopeful and half afraid of some new danger, Frodo and Sam now both<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stood still. Suddenly out of a long string of nonsense-words (or so they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">seemed) the voice rose up loud and clear and burst into this song:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Hey! Come merry dot ! derry dol! My darling!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Light goes the weather-wind and the feathered starling.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Down along under Hill, shining in the sunlight,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Waiting on the doorstep for the cold starlight,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There my pretty lady is. River-woman's daughter,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Slender as the willow-wand, clearer than the water.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Old Tom Bombadil water-lilies bringing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Comes hopping home again. Can you hear him singing?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Hey! Come merry dol! deny dol! and merry-o,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Goldberry, Goldberry, merry yellow berry-o!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Poor old Willow-man, you tuck your roots away!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Tom's in a hurry now. Evening will follow day.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Tom's going home again water-lilies bringing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Hey! Come derry dol! Can you hear me singing?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo and Sam stood as if enchanted. The wind puffed out. The leaves<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hung silently again on stiff branches. There was another burst of song, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">then suddenly, hopping and dancing along the path, there appeared above the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">reeds an old battered hat with a tall crown and a long blue feather stuck in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the band. With another hop and a bound there came into view a man, or so it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">seemed. At any rate he was too large and heavy for a hobbit, if not quite<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">tall enough for one of the Big People, though he made noise enough for one,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">slumping along with great yellow boots on his thick legs, and charging<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">through grass and rushes like a cow going down to drink. He had a blue coat<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and a long brown beard; his eyes were blue and bright, and his face was red<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">as a ripe apple, but creased into a hundred wrinkles of laughter. In his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hands he carried on a large leaf as on a tray a small pile of white<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">water-lilies.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Help!' cried Frodo and Sam running towards him with their hands<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stretched out.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Whoa! Whoa! steady there!â€™ cried the old man, holding up one hand, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they stopped short, as if they had been struck stiff. 'Now, my little<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fellows, where be you a-going to, puffing like a bellows? What's the matter<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">here then? Do you know who I am? I'm Tom Bombadil. Tell me what's<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">your<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">trouble! Tom's in a hurry now. Don't you crush my lilies!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'My friends are caught in the willow-tree,' cried Frodo breathlessly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Master Merry's being squeezed in a crack!' cried Sam.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'What?' shouted Tom Bombadil, leaping up in the air. 'Old Man Willow?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Naught worse than that, eh? That can soon be mended. I know the tune for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">him. Old grey Willow-man! I'll freeze his marrow cold, if he don't behave<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">himself. I'll sing his roots off. I'll sing a wind up and blow leaf and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">branch away. Old Man Willow!' Setting down his lilies carefully on the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">grass, he ran to the tree. There he saw Merry's feet still sticking out -<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the rest had already been drawn further inside. Tom put his mouth to the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">crack and began singing into it in a low voice. They could not catch the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">words, but evidently Merry was aroused. His legs began to kick. Tom sprang<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">away, and breaking off a hanging branch smote the side of the willow with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it. 'You let them out again, Old Man Willow!' he said. 'What be you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a-thinking of? You should not be waking. Eat earth! Dig deep! Drink water!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Go to sleep! Bombadil is talking!' He then seized Merry's feet and drew him<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">out of the suddenly widening crack.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There was a tearing creak and the other crack split open, and out of it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Pippin sprang, as if he had been kicked. Then with a loud snap both cracks<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">closed fast again. A shudder ran through the tree from root to tip, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">complete silence fell.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Thank you!' said the hobbits, one after the other.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Tom Bombadil burst out laughing. 'Well, my little fellows!' said he,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stooping so that he peered into their faces. 'You shall come home with me!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The table is all laden with yellow cream, honeycomb, and white bread and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">butter. Goldberry is waiting. Time enough for questions around the supper<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">table. You follow after me as quick as you are able!' With that he picked up<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his lilies, and then with a beckoning wave of his hand went hopping and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dancing along the path eastward, still singing loudly and nonsensically.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Too surprised and too relieved to talk, the hobbits followed after him<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">as fast as they could. But that was not fast enough. Tom soon disappeared in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">front of them, and the noise of his singing got fainter and further away.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Suddenly his voice came floating back to them in a loud halloo!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Hop along, my little friends, up the Withywindle!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Tom's going on ahead candles for to kindle.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Down west sinks the Sun: soon you will be groping.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">When the night-shadows fall, then the door will open,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Out of the window-panes light will twinkle yellow.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Fear no alder black! Heed no hoary willow!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Fear neither root nor bough! Tom goes on before you.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Hey now! merry dot! We'll be waiting for you!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After that the hobbits heard no more. Almost at once the sun seemed to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sink into the trees behind them. They thought of the slanting light of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">evening glittering on the Brandywine River, and the windows of Bucklebury<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">beginning to gleam with hundreds of lights. Great shadows fell across them;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">trunks and branches of trees hung dark and threatening over the path. White<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mists began to rise and curl on the surface of the river and stray about the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">roots of the trees upon its borders. Out of the very ground at their feet a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shadowy steam arose and mingled with the swiftly falling dusk.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It became difficult to follow the path, and they were very tired. Their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">legs seemed leaden. Strange furtive noises ran among the bushes and reeds on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">either side of them; and if they looked up to the pale sky, they caught<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sight of queer gnarled and knobbly faces that gloomed dark against the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">twilight, and leered down at them from the high bank and the edges of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wood. They began to feel that all this country was unreal, and that they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were stumbling through an ominous dream that led to no awakening.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Just as they felt their feet slowing down to a standstill, they noticed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that the ground was gently rising. The water began to murmur. In the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">darkness they caught the white glimmer of foam, where the river flowed over<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a short fall. Then suddenly the trees came to an end and the mists were left<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">behind. They stepped out from the Forest, and found a wide sweep of grass<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">welling up before them. The river, now small and swift, was leaping merrily<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">down to meet them, glinting here and there in the light of the stars, which<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were already shining in the sky.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The grass under their feet was smooth and short, as if it had been mown<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">or shaven. The eaves of the Forest behind were clipped, and trim as a hedge.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The path was now plain before them, well -tended and bordered with stone. It<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wound up on to the top of a grassy knoll, now grey under the pale starry<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">night; and there, still high above them on a further slope, they saw the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">twinkling lights of a house. Down again the path went, and then up again, up<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a long smooth hillside of turf, towards the light. Suddenly a wide yellow<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">beam flowed out brightly from a door that was opened. There was Tom<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bombadilâ€™s house before them, up, down, under hill. Behind it a steep<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shoulder of the land lay grey and bare, and beyond that the dark shapes of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Barrow-downs stalked away into the eastern night.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They all hurried forward, hobbits and ponies. Already half their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">weariness and all their fears had fallen from them. Hey! Come merry dol!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">rolled out the song to greet them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Hey! Come derry dol! Hop along, my hearties!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Hobbits! Ponies all! We are fond of parties.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Now let the fun begin! Let us sing together!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Then another clear voice, as young and as ancient as Spring, like the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">song of a glad water flowing down into the night from a bright morning in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the hills, came falling like silver to meet them:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Now let the song begin! Let us sing together<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Of sun, stars, moon and mist, rain and cloudy weather,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Light on the budding leaf, dew on the feather,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Wind on the open hill, bells on the heather,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Reeds by the shady pool, lilies on the water:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Old Tom Bombadil and the River-daughter!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And with that song the hobbits stood upon the threshold, and a golden<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">light was all about them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Chapter 7 . In the House of Tom Bombadil<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The four hobbits stepped over the wide stone threshold, and stood<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">still, blinking. They were in a long low room, filled with the light of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">lamps swinging from the beams of the roof; and on the table of dark polished<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wood stood many candles, tall and yellow, burning brightly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In a chair, at the far side of the room facing the outer door, sat a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">woman. Her long yellow hair rippled down her shoulders; her gown was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">green,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">green as young reeds, shot with silver like beads of dew; and her belt was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of gold, shaped like a chain of flag-lilies set with the pale-blue eyes of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">forget-me-nots. About her feel in wide vessels of green and brown<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">earthenware, white water-lilies were floating, so that she seemed to be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">enthroned in the midst of a pool.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™Enter, good guests!' she said, and as she spoke they knew that it was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">her clear voice they had heard singing. They came a few timid steps further<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">into the room, and began to bow low, feeling strangely surprised and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">awkward, like folk that, knocking at a cottage door to beg for a drink of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">water, have been answered by a fair young elf-queen clad in living flowers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But before they could say anything, she sprang lightly up and over the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">lily -bowls, and ran laughing towards them; and as she ran her gown rustled<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">softly like the wind in the flowering borders of a river.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™Come dear folk!' she said, taking Frodo by the hand. Faugh and be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">merry! I am Goldberry, daughter of the River.' Then lightly she passed them<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and closing the door she turned her back to it, with her white arms spread<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">out across it. 'Let us shut out the night!' she said. 'For you are still<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">afraid, perhaps, of mist and tree-shadows and deep water, and untame things.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Fear nothing! For tonight you are under the roof of Tom Bombadil.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The hobbits looked at her in wonder; and she looked at each of them and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">smiled. 'Fair lady Goldberry!' said Frodo at last, feeling his heart moved<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with a joy that he did not understand. He stood as he had at times stood<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">enchanted by fair el ven- voices; but the spell that was now laid upon him was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">different: less keen and lofty was the delight, but deeper and nearer to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mortal heart; marvellous and yet not strange. 'Fair lady Goldberry!' he said<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">again. 'Now the joy that was hidden in the songs we heard is made plain to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">me.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">O slender as a willow-wand! O clearer than clear water !<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">O reed by the living pool! Fair River-daughter!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">O spring-time and summer-time, and spring again after!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">O wind on the waterfall, and the leaves' laughter!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Suddenly he stopped and stammered, overcome with surprise to hear<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">himself saying such things. But Goldberry laughed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Welcome!' she said. 'I had not heard that folk of the Shire were so<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sweet -tongued. But I see you are an elf-friend; the light in your eyes and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the ring in your voice tells it. This is a merry meeting! Sit now, and wait<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">for the Master of the house! He will not be long. He is tending your tired<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">beasts.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The hobbits sat down gladly in low rush-seated chairs, while Goldberry<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">busied herself about the table; and their eyes followed her, for the slender<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">grace of her movement filled them with quiet delight. From somewhere behind<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the house came the sound of singing. Every now and again they caught, among<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">many a derry dol and a merry dol and a ring a ding dillo the repeated words:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Old Tom Bombadil is a merry fellow;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bright blue his jacket is, and his boots are yellow.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Fair lady!' said Frodo again after a while. 'Tell me, if my asking<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">does not seem foolish, who is Tom Bombadil?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'He is,' said Goldberry, staying her swift movements and smiling.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo looked at her questioningly. 'He is, as you have seen him,' she<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">said in answer to his look. 'He is the Master of wood, water, and hill.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Then all this strange land belongs to him?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'No indeed!' she answered, and her smile faded. 'That would indeed be a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">burden,' she added in a low voice, as if to herself. 'The trees and the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">grasses and all things growing or living in the land belong each to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">themselves. Tom Bombadil is the Master. No one has ever caught old Tom<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">walking in the forest, wading in the water, leaping on the hill-tops under<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">light and shadow. He has no fear. Tom Bombadil is master.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A door opened and in came Tom Bombadil. He had now no hat and his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">thick<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">brown hair was crowned with autumn leaves. He laughed, and going to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Goldberry, took her hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Here's my pretty lady!' he said, bowing to the hobbits. 'Here's my<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Goldberry clothed all in silver -green with flowers in her girdle! Is the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">table laden? I see yellow cream and honeycomb, and white bread, and butter;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">milk, cheese, and green herbs and ripe berries gathered. Is that enough for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">us? Is the supper ready?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'It is,' said Goldberry; 'but the guests perhaps are not?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Tom clapped his hands and cried: 'Tom, Tom! your guests are tired, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you had near forgotten! Come now, my merry friends, and Tom will refresh<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you! You shall clean grimy hands, and wash your weary faces; cast off your<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">muddy cloaks and comb out your tangles!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He opened the door, and they followed him down a short passage and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">round a sharp turn. They came to a low room with a sloping roof (a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">penthouse, it seemed, built on to the north end of the house). Its walls<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were of clean stone, but they were mostly covered with green hanging mats<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and yellow curtains. The floor was flagged, and strewn with fresh green<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">rushes. There were four deep mattresses, each piled with white blankets,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">laid on the floor along one side. Against the opposite wall was a long bench<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">laden with wide earthenware basins, and beside it stood brown ewers filled<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with water, some cold, some steaming hot. There were soft green slippers set<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ready beside each bed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Before long, washed and refreshed, the hobbits were seated at the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">table, two on each side, while at either end sat Goldberry and the Master.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It was a long and merry meal. Though the hobbits ate, as only famished<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hobbits can eat, there was no lack. The drink in their drinking -bowls seemed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to be clear cold water, yet it went to their hearts like wine and set free<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">their voices. The guests became suddenly aware that they were singing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">merrily, as if it was easier and more natural than talking.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At last Tom and Goldberry rose and cleared the table swiftly. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">guests were commanded to sit quiet, and were set in chairs, each with a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">footstool to his tired feet. There was a fire in the wide hearth before<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">them, and it was burning with a sweet smell, as if it were built of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">apple-wood. When everything was set in order, all the lights in the room<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were put out, except one lamp and a pair of candles at each end of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">chimney-shelf. Then Goldberry came and stood before them, holding a candle;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and she wished them each a good night and deep sleep.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Have peace now,' she said, 'until the morning! Heed no nightly noises!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For nothing passes door and window here save moonlight and starlight and the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wind off the hill-top. Good night!' She passed out of the room with a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">glimmer and a rustle. The sound of her footsteps was like a stream falling<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">gently away downhill over cool stones in the quiet of night.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Tom sat on a while beside them in silence, while each of them tried to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">muster the courage to ask one of the many questions he had meant to ask at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">supper. Sleep gathered on their eyelids. At last Frodo spoke:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Did you hear me calling, Master, or was it just chance that brought<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you at that moment?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Tom stirred like a man shaken out of a pleasant dream. 'Eh, what?' said<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he. 'Did I hear you calling? Nay, I did not hear: I was busy singing. Just<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">chance brought me then, if chance you call it. It was no plan of mine,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">though I was waiting for you. We heard news of you, and learned that you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were wandering. We guessed you'd come ere long down to the water: all paths<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">lead that way, down to Withywindle. Old grey Willow-man, he's a mighty<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">singer; and it's hard for little folk to escape his cunning mazes. But Tom<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">had an errand there, that he dared not hinder.' Tom nodded as if sleep was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">taking him again; but he went on in a soft singing voice:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I had an errand there: gathering water-lilies,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">green leaves and lilies white to please my pretty lady,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the last ere the year's end to keep them from the winter,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to flower by her pretty feet tilt the snows are melted.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Each year at summer's end I go to find them for her,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in a wide pool, deep and clear, far down Withywindle;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">there they open first in spring and there they linger latest.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">By that pool long ago I found the River-daughter,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fair young Goldberry sitting in the rushes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sweet was her singing then, and her heart was beating!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He opened his eyes and looked at them with a sudden glint of blue:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And that proved well for you â€” for now I shall no longer<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">go down deep again along the forest-water,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">not while the year is old. Nor shall I be passing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Old Man Willow's house this side of spring-time,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">not till the merry spring, when the River-daughter<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dances down the withy-path to bathe in the water.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He fell silent again; but Frodo could not help asking one more<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">question: the one he most desired to have answered. 'Tell us, Master,' he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">said, 'about the Willow-man. What is he? I have never heard of him before.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'No, don't!' said Merry and Pippin together, sitting suddenly upright.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Not now! Not until the morning!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">That is right!' said the old man. 'Now is the time for resting. Some<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">things are ill to hear when the world's in shadow. Sleep till the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">morning -light, rest on the pillow ! Heed no nightly noise! Fear no grey<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">willow!' And with that he took down the lamp and blew it out, and grasping a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">candle in either hand he led them out of the room.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Their mattresses and pillows were soft as down, and the blankets were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of white wool. They had hardly laid themselves on the deep beds and drawn<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the light covers over them before they were asleep.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the dead night, Frodo lay in a dream without light. Then he saw the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">young moon rising; under its thin light there loomed before him a black wall<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of rock, pierced by a dark arch like a great gate. It seemed to Frodo that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he was lifted up, and passing over he saw that the rock-wall was a circle of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hills, and that within it was a plain, and in the midst of the plain stood a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">pinnacle of stone, like a vast tower but not made by hands. On its top stood<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the figure of a man. The moon as it rose seemed to hang for a moment above<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his head and glistened in his white hair as the wind stirred it. Up from the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dark plain below came the crying of fell voices, and the howling of many<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wolves. Suddenly a shadow, like the shape of great wings, passed across the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">moon. The figure lifted his arms and a light flashed from the staff that he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wielded. A mighty eagle swept down and bore him away. The voices wailed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the wolves yammered. There was a noise like a strong wind blowing, and on it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was borne the sound of hoofs, galloping, galloping, galloping from the East.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Black Riders!' thought Frodo as he wakened, with the sound of the hoofs<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">still echoing in his mind. He wondered if he would ever again have the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">courage to leave the safety of these stone walls. He lay motionless, still<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">listening; but all was now silent, and at last he turned and fell asleep<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">again or wandered into some other unremembered dream.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At his side Pippin lay dreaming pleasantly; but a change came over his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dreams and he turned and groaned. Suddenly he woke, or thought he had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">waked,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and yet still heard in the darkness the sound that had disturbed his dream:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">tip-tap, squeak : the noise was like branches fretting in the wind,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">twig-fingers scraping wall and window: creak, creak, creak. He wondered if<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">there were willow-trees close to the house; and then suddenly he had a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dreadful feeling that he was not in an ordinary house at all, but inside the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">willow and listening to that horrible dry creaking voice laughing at him<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">again. He sat up, and felt the soft pillows yield to his hands, and he lay<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">down again relieved. He seemed to hear the echo of words in his ears: â€™Fear<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">nothing! Have peace until the morning! Heed no nightly noises!' Then he went<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to sleep again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It was the sound of water that Merry heard falling into his quiet<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sleep: water streaming down gently, and then spreading, spreading<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">irresistibly all round the house into a dark shoreless pool. It gurgled<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">under the walls, and was rising slowly but surely. 'I shall be drowned!' he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">thought. It will find its way in, and then I shall drown.' He felt that he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was lying in a soft slimy bog, and springing up he set his fool on the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">corner of a cold hard flagstone. Then he remembered where he was and lay<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">down again. He seemed to hear or remember hearing: 'Nothing passes doors or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">windows save moonlight and starlight and the wind off the hill-top.' A<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">little breath of sweet air moved the curtain. He breathed deep and fell<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">asleep again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As far as he could remember, Sam slept through the night in deep<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">content, if logs are contented.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They woke up, all four at once, in the morning light. Tom was moving<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">about the room whistling like a starling. When he heard them stir he clapped<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his hands, and cried: 'Hey! Come merry dol! derry dol! My hearties!' He drew<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">back the yellow curtains, and the hobbits saw that these had covered the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">windows, at either end of the room, one looking east and the other looking<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">west.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They leapt up refreshed. Frodo ran to the eastern window, and found<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">himself looking into a kitchen-garden grey with dew. He had half expected to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">see turf right up to the walls, turf all pocked with hoof-prints. Actually<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his view was screened by a tall line of beans on poles; but above and far<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">beyond them the grey top of the hill loomed up against the sunrise. It was a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">pale morning: in the East, behind long clouds like lines of soiled wool<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stained red at the edges, lay glimmering deeps of yellow. The sky spoke of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">rain to come; but the light was broadening quickly, and the red flowers on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the beans began to glow against the wet green leaves.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Pippin looked out of the western window, down into a pool of mist. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Forest was hidden under a fog. It was like looking down on to a sloping<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">cloud-roof from above. There was a fold or channel where the mist was broken<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">into many plumes and billows; the valley of the Withywindle. The stream ran<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">down the hill on the left and vanished into the white shadows. Near at hand<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was a flower-garden and a clipped hedge silver -netted, and beyond that grey<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shaven grass pale with dew-drops. There was no willow-tree to be seen.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Good morning, merry friends!' cried Tom, opening the eastern window<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wide. A cool air flowed in; it had a rainy smell. 'Sun won't show her face<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">much today. I'm thinking. I have been walking wide, leaping on the hilltops,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">since the grey dawn began, nosing wind and weather, wet grass underfoot, wet<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sky above me. I wakened Goldberry singing under window; but nought<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wakes<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hobbit-folk in the early morning. In the night little folk wake up in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">darkness, and sleep after light has come! Ring a ding dillo! Wake now, my<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">merry friends! Forget the nightly noises! Ring a ding dillo del! derry del,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">my hearties! If you come soon you'll find breakfast on the table. If you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">come late you'll get grass and rain-water!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Needless to say - not that Tom's threat sounded very serious - the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hobbits came soon, and left the table late and only when it was beginning lo<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">look rather empty. Neither Tom nor Goldberry were there. Tom could be heard<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">about the house, clattering in the kitchen, and up and down the stairs, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">singing here and there outside. The room looked westward over the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mist-clouded valley, and the window was open. Water dripped down from the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">thatched eaves above. Before they had finished breakfast the clouds had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">joined into an unbroken roof, and a straight grey rain came softly and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">steadily down. Behind its deep curtain the Forest was completely veiled.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As they looked out of the window there came falling gently as if it was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">flowing down the rain out of the sky, the clear voice of Goldberry singing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">up above them. They could hear few words, but it seemed plain to them that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the song was a rain-song, as sweet as showers on dry hills, that told the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">tale of a river from the spring in the highlands to the Sea far below. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hobbits listened with delight; and Frodo was glad in his heart, and blessed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the kindly weather, because it delayed them from departing. The thought of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">going had been heavy upon him from the moment he awoke; but he guessed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">now<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that they would not go further that day.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The upper wind settled in the West and deeper and wetter clouds rolled<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">up to spill their laden rain on the bare heads of the Downs. Nothing could<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">be seen all round the house but falling water. Frodo stood near the open<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">door and watched the white chalky path turn into a little river of milk and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">go bubbling away down into the valley. Tom Bombadil came trotting round<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">corner of the house, waving his arms as if he was warding off the rain - and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">indeed when he sprang over the threshold he seemed quite dry, except for his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">boots. These he took off and put in the chimney-corner. Then he sat in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">largest chair and called the hobbits to gather round him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">This is Goldberry's washing day,' he said, â€™and her autumn-cleaning.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Too wet for hobbit-folk - let them rest while they are able! Itâ€™s a good day<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">for long tales, for questions and for answers, so Tom will start the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">talking.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He then told them many remarkable stories, sometimes half as if<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">speaking to himself, sometimes looking at them suddenly with a bright blue<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">eye under his deep brows. Often his voice would turn to song, and he would<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">get out of his chair and dance about. He told them tales of bees and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">flowers, the ways of trees, and the strange creatures of the Forest, about<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the evil things and good things, things friendly and things unfriendly,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">cruel things and kind things, and secrets hidden under brambles.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As they listened, they began to understand the lives of the Forest,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">apart from themselves, indeed to feel themselves as the strangers where all<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">other things were at home. Moving constantly in and out of his talk was Old<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Man Willow, and Frodo learned now enough to content him, indeed more<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">than<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">enough, for it was not comfortable lore. Tomâ€™s words laid bare the hearts of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">trees and their thoughts, which were often dark and strange, and filled with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a hatred of things that go free upon the earth, gnawing, biting, breaking,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hacking, burning: destroyers and usurpers. It was not called the Old Forest<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">without reason, for it was indeed ancient, a survivor of vast forgotten<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">woods; and in it there lived yet, ageing no quicker than the hills, the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fathers of the fathers of trees, remembering times when they were lords. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">countless years had filled them with pride and rooted wisdom, and with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">malice. But none were more dangerous than the Great Willow: his heart was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">rotten, but his strength was green; and he was cunning, and a master of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">winds, and his song and thought ran through the woods on both sides of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">river. His grey thirsty spirit drew power out of the earth and spread like<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fine root-threads in the ground, and invisible twig-fingers in the air, till<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it had under its dominion nearly all the trees of the Forest from the Hedge<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to the Downs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Suddenly Tomâ€™s talk left the woods and went leaping up the young<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stream, over bubbling waterfalls, over pebbles and worn rocks, and among<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">small flowers in close grass and wet crannies, wandering at last up on to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Downs. They heard of the Great Barrows, and the green mounds, and the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stone-rings upon the hills and in the hollows among the hills. Sheep were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">bleating in flocks. Green walls and white walls rose. There were fortresses<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">on the heights. Kings of little kingdoms fought together, and the young Sun<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shone like fire on the red metal of their new and greedy swords. There was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">victory and defeat; and towers fell, fortresses were burned, and flames went<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">up into the sky. Gold was piled on the biers of dead kings and queens; and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mounds covered them, and the stone doors were shut; and the grass grew over<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">all. Sheep walked for a while biting the grass, but soon the hills were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">empty again. A shadow came out of dark places far away, and the bones were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stirred in the mounds. Barrow- wights walked in the hollow places with a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">clink of rings on cold fingers, and gold chains in the wind.' Stone rings<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">grinned out of the ground like broken teeth in the moonlight.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The hobbits shuddered. Even in the Shire the rumour of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Barrow- wights of the Barrow-downs beyond the Forest had been heard. But it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was not a tale that any hobbit liked to listen to, even by a comfortable<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fireside far away. These four now suddenly remembered what the joy of this<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">house had driven from their minds: the house of Tom Bombadil nestled under<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the very shoulder of those dreaded hills. They lost the thread of his tale<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and shifted uneasily, looking aside at one another.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">When they caught his words again they found that he had now wandered<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">into strange regions beyond their memory and beyond their waking thought,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">into limes when the world was wider, and the seas flowed straight to the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">western Shore; and still on and back Tom went singing out into ancient<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">starlight, when only the Elf-sires were awake. Then suddenly he slopped, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they saw that he nodded as if he was falling asleep. The hobbits sat still<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">before him, enchanted; and it seemed as if, under the spell of his words,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the wind had gone, and the clouds had dried up, and the day had been<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">withdrawn, and darkness had come from East and West, and all the sky was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">filled with the light of white stars.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Whether the morning and evening of one day or of many days had passed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo could not tell. Ele did not feel either hungry or tired, only filled<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with wonder. The stars shone through the window and the silence of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">heavens seemed to be round him. He spoke at last out of his wonder and a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sudden fear of that silence:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™Who are you, Master?' he asked.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™Eh, what?' said Tom sitting up, and his eyes glinting in the gloom.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Don't you know my name yet? That's the only answer. Tell me, who are you,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">alone, yourself and nameless? But you are young and I am old. Eldest, that's<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">what I am. Mark my words, my friends: Tom was here before the river and the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">trees; Tom remembers the first raindrop and the first acorn. He made paths<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">before the Big People, and saw the little People arriving. He was here<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">before the Kings and the graves and the Barrow- wights. When the Elves passed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">westward, Tom was here already, before the seas were bent. He knew the dark<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">under the stars when it was fearless - before the Dark Lord came from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Outside.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A shadow seemed to pass by the window, and the hobbits glanced hastily<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">through the panes. When they turned again, Goldberry stood in the door<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">behind, framed in light. She held a candle, shielding its flame from the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">draught with her hand; and the light flowed through it, like sunlight<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">through a white shell.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'The rain has ended,' she said; 'and new waters are running downhill,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">under the stars. Let us now laugh and be glad!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'And let us have food and drink!' cried Tom. 'Long tales are thirsty.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And long listening's hungry work, morning, noon, and evening!' With that he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">jumped out of his chair, and with a bound took a candle from the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">chimney-shelf and lit it in the flame that Goldberry held; then he danced<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">about the table. Suddenly he hopped through the door and disappeared.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Quickly he returned, bearing a large and laden tray. Then Tom and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Goldberry set the table; and the hobbits sat half in wonder and half in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">laughter: so fair was the grace of Goldberry and so merry and odd the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">caperings of Tom. Yet in some fashion they seemed to weave a single dance,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">neither hindering the other, in and out of the room, and round about the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">table; and with great speed food and vessels and lights were set in order.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The boards blazed with candles, white and yellow. Tom bowed to his guests.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Supper is ready,' said Goldberry; and now the hobbits saw that she was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">clothed all in silver with a white girdle, and her shoes were like fishes'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mail. But Tom was all in clean blue, blue as rain-washed forget-me-nots, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he had green stockings.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It was a supper even better than before. The hobbits under the spell of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Tom's words may have missed one meal or many, but when the food was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">before<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">them it seemed at least a week since they had eaten. They did not sing or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">even speak much for a while, and paid close attention to business. But after<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a time their hearts and spirit rose high again, and their voices rang out in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mirth and laughter.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After they had eaten, Goldberry sang many songs for them, songs that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">began merrily in the hills and fell softly down into silence; and in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">silences they saw in their minds pools and waters wider than any they had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">known, and looking into them they saw the sky below them and the stars like<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">jewels in the depths. Then once more she wished them each good night and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">left them by the fireside. But Tom now seemed wide awake and plied them<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">questions.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He appeared already to know much about them and all their families, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">indeed to know much of all the history and doings of the Shire down from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">days hardly remembered among the hobbits themselves. It no longer surprised<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">them; but he made no secret that he owed his recent knowledge largely to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Farmer Maggot, whom he seemed to regard as a person of more importance<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">than<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they had imagined. 'There's earth under his old feet, and clay on his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fingers; wisdom in his bones, and both his eyes are open,' said Tom. It was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">also clear that Tom had dealings with the Elves, and it seemed that in some<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fashion, news had reached him from Gildor concerning the flight of Frodo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Indeed so much did Tom know, and so cunning was his questioning, that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo found himself telling him more about Bilbo and his own hopes and fears<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">than he had told before even to Gandalf. Tom wagged his head up and down,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and there was a glint in his eyes when he heard of the Riders.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Show me the precious Ring!' he said suddenly in the midst of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">story: and Frodo, to his own astonishment, drew out the chain from his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">pocket, and unfastening the Ring handed it at once to Tom.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It seemed to grow larger as it lay for a moment on his big<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">brown-skinned hand. Then suddenly he put it to his eye and laughed. For a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">second the hobbits had a vision, both comical and alarming, of his bright<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">blue eye gleaming through a circle of gold. Then Tom put the Ring round the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">end of his little finger and held it up to the candlelight. For a moment the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hobbits noticed nothing strange about this. Then they gasped. There was no<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sign of Tom disappearing!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Tom laughed again, and then he spun the Ring in the air - and it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">vanished with a flash. Frodo gave a cry - and Tom leaned forward and handed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it back to him with a smile.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo looked at it closely, and rather suspiciously (like one who has<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">lent a trinket to a juggler). It was the same Ring, or looked the same and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">weighed the same: for that Ring had always seemed to Frodo to weigh<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">strangely heavy in the hand. But something prompted him to make sure. He<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">perhaps a trifle annoyed with Tom for seeming to make so light of what even<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gandalf thought so perilously important. He waited for an opportunity, when<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the talk was going again, and Tom was telling an absurd story about badgers<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and their queer ways - then he slipped the Ring on.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Merry turned towards him to say something and gave a start, and checked<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">an exclamation. Frodo was delighted (in a way): it was his own ring all<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">right, for Merry was staring blankly at his chair, and obviously could not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">see him. He got up and crept quietly away from the fireside towards the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">outer door.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Hey there!' cried Tom, glancing towards him with a most seeing look in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his shining eyes. 'Hey! Come Frodo, there! Where be you a-going? Old Tom<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bombadil's not as blind as that yet. Take off your golden ring! Your hand's<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">more fair without it. Come back! Leave your game and sit down beside me!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">We<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">must talk a while more, and think about the morning. Tom must teach the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">right road, and keep your feet from wandering.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo laughed (trying to feel pleased), and taking off the Ring he came<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and sat down again. Tom now told them that he reckoned the Sun would shine<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">tomorrow, and it would be a glad morning, and setting out would be hopeful.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But they would do well to start early; for weather in that country was a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">thing that even Tom could not be sure of for long, and it would change<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sometimes quicker than he could change his jacket. 'I am no weather-master,'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he said; 'nor is aught that goes on two legs.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">By his advice they decided to make nearly due North from his house,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">over the western and lower slopes of the Downs: they might hope in that way<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to strike the East Road in a day's journey, and avoid the Barrows. He told<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">them not to be afraid - but to mind their own business.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Keep to the green grass. Don't you go a-meddling with old stone or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that never falter!' He said this more than once; and he advised them to pass<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">barrows by on the west-side, if they chanced to stray near one. Then he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">taught them a rhyme to sing, if they should by ill-luck fall into any danger<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">or difficulty the next day.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Ho! Tom Bombadil, Tom Bombadillo!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">When they had sung this altogether after him, he clapped them each on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the shoulder with a laugh, and taking candles led them back to their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">That night they heard no noises. But either in his dreams or out of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">them, he could not tell which, Frodo heard a sweet singing running in his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mind; a song that seemed to come like a pale light behind a grey<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">rain-curtain, and growing stronger to turn the veil all to glass and silver,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">until at last it was rolled back, and a far green country opened before him<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">under a swift sunrise.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The vision melted into waking; and there was Tom whistling like a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">tree-full of birds; and the sun was already slanting down the hill and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">through the open window. Outside everything was green and pale gold.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After breakfast, which they again ate alone, they made ready to say<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">farewell, as nearly heavy of heart as was possible on such a morning: cool,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">bright, and clean under a washed autumn sky of thin blue. The air came fresh<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">from the North-west. Their quiet ponies were almost frisky, sniffing and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">moving restlessly. Tom came out of the house and waved his hat and danced<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">upon the doorstep, bidding the hobbits to get up and be off and go with good<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">speed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They rode off along a path that wound away from behind the house, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">went slanting up towards the north end of the hill -brow under which it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sheltered. They had just dismounted to lead their ponies up the last steep<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">slope, when suddenly Frodo stopped.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Goldberry!' he cried. 'My fair lady, clad all in silver green! We have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">never said farewell to her, nor seen her since the evening!' He was so<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">distressed that he turned back; but at that moment a clear call came<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">rippling down. There on the hill-brow she stood beckoning to them: her hair<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was flying loose, and as it caught the sun it shone and shimmered. A light<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">like the glint of water on dewy grass flashed from under her feet as she<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">danced.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They hastened up the last slope, and stood breathless beside her. They<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">bowed, but with a wave of her arm she bade them look round; and they looked<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">out from the hill-top over lands under the morning. It was now as clear and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">far-seen as it had been veiled and misty when they stood upon the knoll in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Forest, which could now be seen rising pale and green out of the dark<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">trees in the West. In that direction the land rose in wooded ridges, green,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">yellow, russet under the sun, beyond which lay hidden the valley of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Brandywine. To the South, over the line of the Withywindle, there was a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">distant glint like pale glass where the Brandywine River made a great loop<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in the lowlands and flowed away out of the knowledge of the hobbits.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Northward beyond the dwindling downs the land ran away in flats and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">swellings of grey and green and pale earth -colours, until it faded into a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">featureless and shadowy distance. Eastward the Barrow-downs rose, ridge<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">behind ridge into the morning, and vanished out of eyesight into a guess: it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was no more than a guess of blue and a remote white glimmer blending with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the hem of the sky, but it spoke to them, out of memory and old tales, of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the high and distant mountains.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They took a deep draught of the air, and felt that a skip and a few<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stout strides would bear them wherever they wished. It seemed fainthearted<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to go jogging aside over the crumpled skirts of the downs towards the Road,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">when they should be leaping, as lusty as Tom, over the stepping stones of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the hills straight towards the Mountains.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Goldberry spoke to them and recalled their eyes and thoughts. â€™Speed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">now, fair guests!â€™ she said. 'And hold to your purpose! North with the wind<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in the left eye and a blessing on your footsteps! Make haste while the Sun<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shines!' And to Frodo she said: 'Farewell, Elf-friend, it was a merry<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">meeting!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But Frodo found no words to answer. He bowed low, and mounted his pony,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and followed by his friends jogged slowly down the gentle slope behind the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hill. Tom Bombadil's house and the valley, and the Forest were lost to view.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The air grew warmer between the green walls of hillside and hillside, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the scent of turf rose strong and sweet as they breathed. Turning back, when<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they reached the bottom of the green hollow, they saw Goldberry, now small<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and slender like a sunlit flower against the sky: she was standing still<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">watching them, and her hands were stretched out towards them. As they looked<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">she gave a clear call, and lifting up her hand she turned and vanished<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">behind the hill .<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Their way wound along the floor of the hollow, and round the green feet<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of a steep hill into another deeper and broader valley, and then over the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shoulder of further hills, and down their long limbs, and up their smooth<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sides again, up on to new hill-tops and down into new valleys. There was no<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">tree nor any visible water: it was a country of grass and short springy<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">turf, silent except for the whisper of the air over the edges of the land,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and high lonely cries of strange birds. As they journeyed the sun mounted,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and grew hot. Each time they climbed a ridge the breeze seemed to have grown<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">less. When they caught a glimpse of the country westward the distant Forest<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">seemed to be smoking, as if the fallen rain was steaming up again from leaf<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and root and mould. A shadow now lay round the edge of sight, a dark haze<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">above which the upper sky was like a blue cap, hot and heavy.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">About mid-day they came to a hill whose top was wide and flattened,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">like a shallow saucer with a green mounded rim. Inside there was no air<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stirring, and the sky seemed near their heads. They rode across and looked<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">northwards. Then their hearts rose, for it seemed plain that they had come<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">further already than they had expected. Certainly the distances had now all<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">become hazy and deceptive, but there could be no doubt that the Downs were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">coming to an end. A long valley lay below them winding away northwards,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">until it came to an opening between two steep shoulders. Beyond, there<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">seemed to be no more hills. Due north they faintly glimpsed a long dark<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">line. That is a line of trees,' said Merry, 'and that must mark the Road.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">All along it for many leagues east of the Bridge there are trees growing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Some say they were planted in the old days.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Splendid!' said Frodo. 'If we make as good going this afternoon as we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">have done this morning, we shall have left the Downs before the Sun sets and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">be jogging on in search of a camping place.' But even as he spoke he turned<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his glance eastwards, and he saw that on that side the hills were higher and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">looked down upon them; and all those hills were crowned with green mounds,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and on some were standing stones, pointing upwards like jagged teeth out of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">green gums.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">That view was somehow disquieting; so they turned from the sight and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">went down into the hollow circle. In the midst of it there stood a single<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stone, standing tall under the sun above, and at this hour casting no<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shadow. It was shapeless and yet significant: like a landmark, or a guarding<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">finger, or more like a warning. But they were now hungry, and the sun was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">still at the fearless noon; so they set their backs against the east side of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the stone. It was cool, as if the sun had had no power to warm it; but at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that time this seemed pleasant. There they took food and drink, and made as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">good a noon-meal under the open sky as anyone could wish; for the food came<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">from 'down under Hill'. Tom had provided them with plenty for the comfort of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the day. Their ponies unburdened strayed upon the grass.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Riding over the hills, and eating their fill, the warm sun and the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">scent of turf, lying a little too long, stretching out their legs and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">looking at the sky above their noses: these things are, perhaps, enough to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">explain what happened. However, that may be: they woke suddenly and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">uncomfortably from a sleep they had never meant to take. The standing stone<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was cold, and it cast a long pale shadow that stretched eastward over them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The sun, a pale and watery yellow, was gleaming through the mist just above<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the west wall of the hollow in which they lay; north, south, and east,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">beyond the wall the fog was thick, cold and white. The air was silent, heavy<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and chill. Their ponies were standing crowded together with their heads<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">down.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The hobbits sprang to their feet in alarm, and ran to the western rim.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They found that they were upon an island in the fog. Even as they looked out<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in dismay towards the setting sun, it sank before their eyes into a white<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sea, and a cold grey shadow sprang up in the East behind. The fog rolled up<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to the walls and rose above them, and as it mounted it bent over their heads<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">until it became a roof: they were shut in a hall of mist whose central<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">pillar was the standing stone.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They felt as if a trap was closing about them; but they did not quite<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">lose heart. They still remembered the hopeful view they had had of the line<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of the Road ahead, and they still knew in which direction it lay. In any<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">case, they now had so great a dislike for that hollow place about the stone<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that no thought of remaining there was in their minds. They packed up as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">quickly as their chilled fingers would work.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Soon they were leading their ponies in single file over the rim and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">down the long northward slope of the hill, down into a foggy sea. As they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">went down the mist became colder and damper, and their hair hung lank and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dripping on their foreheads. When they reached the bottom it was so cold<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that they halted and got out cloaks and hoods, which soon became bedewed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with grey drops. Then, mounting their ponies, they went slowly on again,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">feeling their way by the rise and fall of the ground. They were steering, as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">well as they could guess, for the gate-like opening at the far northward end<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of the long valley which they had seen in the morning. Once they were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">through the gap, they had only lo keep on in anything like a straight line<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and they were bound in the end to strike the Road. Their thoughts did not go<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">beyond that, except for a vague hope that perhaps away beyond the Downs<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">there might be no fog.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Their going was very slow. To prevent their getting separated and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wandering in different directions they went in file, with Frodo leading. Sam<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was behind him, and after him came Pippin, and then Merry. The valley<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">seemed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to stretch on endlessly. Suddenly Frodo saw a hopeful sign. On either side<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ahead a darkness began to loom through the mist; and he guessed that they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were at last approaching the gap in the hills, the north-gate of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Barrow-downs. If they could pass that, they would be free.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Come on! Follow me!' he called back over his shoulder, and he hurried<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">forward. But his hope soon changed to bewilderment and alarm. The dark<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">patches grew darker, but they shrank; and suddenly he saw, towering ominous<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">before him and leaning slightly towards one another like the pillars of a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">headless door, two huge standing stones. He could not remember having seen<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">any sign of these in the valley, when he looked out from the hill in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">morning. He had passed between them almost before he was aware: and even<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he did so darkness seemed to fall round him. His pony reared and snorted,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and he fell off. When he looked back he found that he was alone: the others<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">had not followed him. 'Sam!' he called. 'Pippin! Merry! Come along! Why<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">don't you keep up?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There was no answer. Fear took him, and he ran back past the stones<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shouting wildly: 'Sam! Sam! Merry! Pippin!' The pony bolted into the mist<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and vanished. From some way off, or so it seemed, he thought he heard a cry:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Hoy! Frodo! Hoy!' It was away eastward, on his left as he stood under the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">great stones, staring and straining into the gloom. He plunged off in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">direction of the call, and found himself going steeply uphill.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As he struggled on he called again, and kept on calling more and more<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">frantically; but he heard no answer for some time, and then it seemed faint<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and far ahead and high above him. 'Frodo! Hoy!' came the thin voices out of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the mist: and then a cry that sounded like help, help! often repeated,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ending with a last help! that trailed off into a long wail suddenly cut<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">short. He stumbled forward with all the speed he could towards the cries;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">but the light was now gone, and clinging night had closed about him, so that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it was impossible to be sure of any direction. He seemed all the time to be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">climbing up and up.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Only the change in the level of the ground at his feet told him when he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">at last came to the top of a ridge or hill. He was weary, sweating and yet<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">chilled. It was wholly dark.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Where are you?' he cried out miserably.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There was no reply. He stood listening. He was suddenly aware that it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was getting very cold, and that up here a wind was beginning to blow, an icy<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wind. A change was coming in the weather. The mist was flowing past him<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">now<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in shreds and tatters. His breath was smoking, and the darkness was less<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">near and thick. He looked up and saw with surprise that faint stars were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">appearing overhead amid the strands of hurrying cloud and fog. The wind<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">began to hiss over the grass.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He imagined suddenly that he caught a muffled cry, and he made towards<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it; and even as he went forward the mist was rolled up and thrust aside, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the starry sky was unveiled. A glance showed him that he was now facing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">southwards and was on a round hill-top, which he must have climbed from the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">north. Out of the east the biting wind was blowing. To his right there<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">loomed against the westward stars a dark black shape. A great barrow stood<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">there.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™Where are you?' he cried again, both angry and afraid.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Here!' said a voice, deep and cold, that seemed to come out of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ground. 'I am waiting for you!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'No!' said Frodo; but he did not run away. His knees gave, and he fell<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">on the ground. Nothing happened, and there was no sound. Trembling he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">looked<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">up, in time to see a tall dark figure like a shadow against the stars. It<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">leaned over him. He thought there were two eyes, very cold though lit with a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">pale light that seemed to come from some remote distance. Then a grip<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stronger and colder than iron seized him. The icy touch froze his bones, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he remembered no more.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">When he came to himself again, for a moment he could recall nothing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">except a sense of dread. Then suddenly he knew that he was imprisoned,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">caught hopelessly; he was in a barrow. A Barrow-wight had taken him, and he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was probably already under the dreadful spells of the Barrow- wights about<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">which whispered tales spoke. He dared not move, but lay as he found himself:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">flat on his back upon a cold stone with his hands on his breast.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But though his fear was so great that it seemed to be part of the very<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">darkness that was round him, he found himself as he lay thinking about Bilbo<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Baggins and his stories, of their jogging along together in the lanes of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Shire and talking about roads and adventures. There is a seed of courage<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hidden (often deeply, it is true) in the heart of the fattest and most timid<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hobbit, wailing for some final and desperate danger to make it grow. Frodo<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was neither very fat nor very timid; indeed, though he did not know it,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bilbo (and Gandalf) had thought him the best hobbit in the Shire. He thought<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he had come to the end of his adventure, and a terrible end, but the thought<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hardened him. He found himself stiffening, as if for a final spring; he no<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">longer felt limp like a helpless prey.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As he lay there, thinking and getting a hold of himself, he noticed all<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">at once that the darkness was slowly giving way: a pale greenish light was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">growing round him. It did not at first show him what kind of a place he was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in, for the light seemed to be coming out of himself, and from the floor<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">beside him, and had not yet reached the roof or wall. He turned, and there<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in the cold glow he saw lying beside him Sam, Pippin, and Merry. They were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">on their backs, and their faces looked deathly pale; and they were clad in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">white. About them lay many treasures, of gold maybe, though in that light<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they looked cold and unlovely. On their heads were circlets, gold chains<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were about their waists, and on their fingers were many rings. Swords lay by<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">their sides, and shields were at their feet. But across their three necks<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">lay one long naked sword.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Suddenly a song began: a cold murmur, rising and falling. The voice<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">seemed far away and immeasurably dreary, sometimes high in the air and thin,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sometimes like a low moan from the ground. Out of the formless stream of sad<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">but horrible sounds, strings of words would now and again shape themselves:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">grim, hard, cold words, heartless and miserable. The night was railing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">against the morning of which it was bereaved, and the cold was cursing the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">warmth for which it hungered. Frodo was chilled to the marrow. After a while<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the song became clearer, and with dread in his heart he perceived that it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">had changed into an incantation:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Cold be hand and heart and bone,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and cold be sleep under stone:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">never mare to wake on stony bed,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">never, till the Sun fails and the Moon is dead.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the black wind the stars shall die,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and still on gold here let them lie,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">till the dark lord lifts his hand<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">over dead sea and withered land.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He heard behind his head a creaking and scraping sound. Raising himself<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">on one arm he looked, and saw now in the pale light that they were in a kind<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of passage which behind them turned a corner. Round the corner a long arm<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was groping, walking on its fingers towards Sam, who was lying nearest, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">towards the hilt of the sword that lay upon him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At first Frodo felt as if he had indeed been turned into stone by the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">incantation. Then a wild thought of escape came to him. He wondered if he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">put on the Ring, whether the Barrow-wight would miss him, and he might find<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">some way out. He thought of himself running free over the grass, grieving<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">for Merry, and Sam, and Pippin, but free and alive himself. Gandalf would<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">admit that there had been nothing else he could do.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But the courage that had been awakened in him was now too strong: he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">could not leave his friends so easily. He wavered, groping in his pocket,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and then fought with himself again; and as he did so the arm crept nearer.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Suddenly resolve hardened in him, and he seized a short sword that lay<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">beside him, and kneeling he stooped low over the bodies of his companions.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">With what strength he had he hewed at the crawling arm near the wrist, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the hand broke off; but at the same moment the sword splintered up to the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hilt. There was a shriek and the light vanished. In the dark there was a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">snarling noise.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo fell forward over Merry, and Merry's face felt cold. All at once<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">back into his mind, from which it had disappeared with the first coming of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the fog, came the memory of the house down under the Hill, and of Tom<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">singing. He remembered the rhyme that Tom had taught them. In a small<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">desperate voice he began: Ho! Tom Bombadil! and with that name his voice<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">seemed to grow strong: it had a full and lively sound, and the dark chamber<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">echoed as if to drum and trumpet.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Ho! Tom Bombadil, Tom Bombadillo!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">By water, wood and hill, by the reed and willow,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">By fire, sun and moon, harken now and hear us!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Come, Tom Bombadil, for our need is near us!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There was a sudden deep silence, in which Frodo could hear his heart<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">beating. After a long slow moment he heard plain, but far away, as if it was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">coming down through the ground or through thick walls, an answering voice<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">singing:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Old Tom Bombadil is a merry fellow,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bright blue his jacket is, and his boots are yellow.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">None has ever caught him yet, for Tom, he is the master:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">His songs are stronger songs, and his feet are faster.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There was a loud rumbling sound, as of stones rolling and falling, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">suddenly light streamed in, real light, the plain light of day. A low<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">door -like opening appeared at the end of the chamber beyond Frodo's feet;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and there was Tom's head (hat, feather, and all) framed against the light of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the sun rising red behind him. The light fell upon the floor, and upon the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">faces of the three hobbits lying beside Frodo. They did not stir, but the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sickly hue had left them. They looked now as if they were only very deeply<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">asleep.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Tom stooped, removed his hat, and came into the dark chamber, singing:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Get out, you old Wight! Vanish in the sunlight!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Shrivel like the cold mist, like the winds go wailing,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Out into the barren lands far beyond the mountains!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Come never here again! Leave your barrow empty!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Lost and forgotten be, darker than the darkness,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Where gates stand for ever shut, till the world is mended.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At these words there was a cry and part of the inner end of the chamber<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fell in with a crash. Then there was a long trailing shriek, fading away<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">into an unguessable distance; and after that silence.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™Come, friend Frodo!' said Tom. 'Let us get out on to clean grass! You<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">must help me bear them.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Together they carried out Merry, Pippin, and Sam. As Frodo left the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">barrow for the last time he thought he saw a severed hand wriggling still,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">like a wounded spider, in a heap of fallen earth. Tom went back in again,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and there was a sound of much thumping and stamping. When he came out he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">bearing in his arms a great load of treasure: things of gold, silver,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">copper, and bronze; many beads and chains and jewelled ornaments. He<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">climbed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the green barrow and laid them all on top in the sunshine.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There he stood, with his hat in his hand and the wind in his hair, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">looked down upon the three hobbits, that had been laid on their backs upon<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the grass at the west side of the mound. Raising his right hand he said in a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">clear and commanding voice:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Wake now my merry tads! Wake and hear me calling!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Warm now be heart and limb! The cold stone is fallen;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Dark door is standing wide; dead hand is broken.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Night under Night is flown, and the Gate is open!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">To Frodoâ€™s great joy the hobbits stirred, stretched their arms, rubbed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">their eyes, and then suddenly sprang up. They looked about in amazement,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">first at Frodo, and then at Tom standing large as life on the barrow-top<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">above them; and then at themselves in their thin white rags, crowned and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">belted with pale gold, and jingling with trinkets.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'What in the name of wonder?' began Merry, feeling the golden circlet<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that had slipped over one eye. Then he stopped, and a shadow came over his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">face, and he closed his eyes. 'Of course, I remember!' he said. 'The men of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Carn Dym came on us at night, and we were worsted. Ah! the spear in my<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">heart!' He clutched at his breast. 'No! No!' he said, opening his eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'What am I saying? I have been dreaming. Where did you get to, Frodo?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I thought that I was lost,' said Frodo; 'but I don't want to speak of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it. Let us think of what we are to do now! Let us go on!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Dressed up like this, sir?' said Sam. 'Where are my clothes?' He flung<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his circlet, belt, and rings on the grass, and looked round helplessly, as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">if he expected to find his cloak, jacket, and breeches, and other<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hobbit-garments lying somewhere to hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You won't find your clothes again,' said Tom, bounding down from the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mound, and laughing as he danced round them in the sunlight. One would have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">thought that nothing dangerous or dreadful had happened; and indeed the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">horror faded out of their hearts as they looked at him, and saw the merry<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">glint in his eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'What do you mean?' asked Pippin, looking at him, half puzzled and half<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">amused. 'Why not?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But Tom shook his head, saying: 'You've found yourselves again, out of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the deep water. Clothes are but little loss, if you escape from drowning. Be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">glad, my merry friends, and let the warm sunlight heal now heart and limb!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Cast off these cold rags! Run naked on the grass, while Tom goes a-hunting!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He sprang away down hill, whistling and calling. Looking down after him<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo saw him running away southwards along the green hollow between<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hill and the next, still whistling and crying:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Hey! now! Come hoy now! Whither do you wander?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Up, down, near or far, here, there or yonder?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sharp-ears, Wise-nose, Swish-tail and Bumpkin,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">White-socks my little lad, and old Fatty Lumpkin!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">So he sang, running fast, tossing up his hat and catching it, until he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was hidden by a fold of the ground: but for some time his hey now! hoy now!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">came floating back down the wind, which had shifted round towards the south.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The air was growing very warm again. The hobbits ran about for a while<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">on the grass, as he told them. Then they lay basking in the sun with the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">delight of those that have been wafted suddenly from bitter winter to a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">friendly clime, or of people that, after being long ill and bedridden, wake<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">one day to find that they are unexpectedly well and the day is again full of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">promise.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">By the time that Tom returned they were feeling strong (and hungry). He<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">reappeared, hat first, over the brow of the hill, and behind him came in an<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">obedient line six ponies: their own five and one more. The last was plainly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">old Fatty Lumpkin: he was larger, stronger, fatter (and older) than their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">own ponies. Merry, to whom the others belonged, had not, in fact, given them<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">any such names, but they answered to the new names that Tom had given<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">them<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">for the rest of their lives. Tom called them one by one and they climbed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">over the brow and stood in a line. Then Tom bowed to the hobbits.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Here are your ponies, now!' he said. 'They've more sense (in some<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ways) than you wandering hobbits have - more sense in their noses. For they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sniff danger ahead which you walk right into; and if they run to save<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">themselves, then they run the right way. You must forgive them all; for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">though their hearts are faithful, to face fear of Barrow- wights is not what<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they were made for. See, here they come again, bringing all their burdens!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Merry, Sam, and Pippin now clothed themselves in spare garments from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">their packs; and they soon felt too hot, for they were obliged to put on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">some of the thicker and warmer things that they had brought against the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">oncoming of winter.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Where does that other old animal, that Fatty Lumpkin, come from?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">asked Frodo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'He's mine,' said Tom. 'My four-legged friend; though I seldom ride<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">him, and he wanders often far, free upon the hillsides. When your ponies<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stayed with me, they got to know my Lumpkin; and they smelt him in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">night, and quickly ran to meet him. I thought he'd look for them and with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his words of wisdom take all their fear away. But now, my jolly Lumpkin, old<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Tom's going to ride. Hey! he's coming with you, just to set you on the road;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">so he needs a pony. For you cannot easily talk to hobbits that are riding,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">when you're on your own legs trying to trot beside them.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The hobbits were delighted to hear this, and thanked Tom many times;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">but he laughed, and said that they were so good at losing themselves that he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">would not feel happy till he had seen them safe over the borders of his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">land. Tve got things to do,' he said: 'my making and my singing, my<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">talking and my walking, and my watching of the country. Tom can't be always<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">near to open doors and willow-cracks. Tom has his house to mind, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Goldberry is waiting.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It was still fairly early by the sun, something between nine and ten,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and the hobbits turned their minds to food. Their last meal had been lunch<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">beside the standing stone the day before. They breakfasted now off the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">remainder of Tom's provisions, meant for their supper, with additions that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Tom had brought with him. It was not a large meal (considering hobbits and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the circumstances), but they felt much better for it. While they were eating<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Tom went up to the mound, and looked through the treasures. Most of these he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">made into a pile that glistened and sparkled on the grass. He bade them lie<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">there 'free to all finders, birds, beasts. Elves or Men, and all kindly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">creatures'; for so the spell of the mound should be broken and scattered and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">no Wight ever come back to it. He chose for himself from the pile a brooch<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">set with blue stones, many-shaded like flax-flowers or the wings of blue<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">butterflies. He looked long at it, as if stirred by some memory, shaking his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">head, and saying at last:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Here is a pretty toy for Tom and for his lady! Fair was she who long<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ago wore this on her shoulder. Goldberry shall wear it now, and we will not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">forget her!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For each of the hobbits he chose a dagger, long, leaf-shaped, and keen,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of marvellous workmanship, damasked with serpent-forms in red and gold.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">gleamed as he drew them from their black sheaths, wrought of some strange<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">metal, light and strong, and set with many fiery stones. Whether by some<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">virtue in these sheaths or because of the spell that lay on the mound, the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">blades seemed untouched by time, unrusted, sharp, glittering in the sun.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Old knives are long enough as swords for hobbit-people,' he said.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Sharp blades are good to have, if Shire-folk go walking, east, south, or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">far away into dark and danger.' Then he told them that these blades were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">forged many long years ago by Men of Westernesse: they were foes of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Dark<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Lord, but they were overcome by the evil king of Carn Dym in the Land of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Angmar.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Few now remember them,' Tom murmured, 'yet still some go wandering,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sons of forgotten kings walking in loneliness, guarding from evil things<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">folk that are heedless.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The hobbits did not understand his words, but as he spoke they had a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">vision as it were of a great expanse of years behind them, like a vast<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shadowy plain over which there strode shapes of Men, tall and grim with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">bright swords, and last came one with a star on his brow. Then the vision<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">faded, and they were back in the sunlit world. It was time to start again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They made ready, packing their bags and lading their ponies. Their new<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">weapons they hung on their leather belts under their jackets, feeling them<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">very awkward, and wondering if they would be of any use. Fighting had not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">before occurred to any of them as one of the adventures in which their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">flight would land them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At last they set off. They led their ponies down the hill; and then<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mounting they trotted quickly along the valley. They looked back and saw the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">top of the old mound on the hill, and from it the sunlight on the gold went<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">up like a yellow flame. Then they turned a shoulder of the Downs and it was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hidden from view.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Though Frodo looked about him on every side he saw no sign of the great<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stones standing like a gate, and before long they came to the northern gap<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and rode swiftly through, and the land fell away before them. It was a merry<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">journey with Tom Bombadil trotting gaily beside them, or before them, on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Fatty Lumpkin, who could move much faster than his girth promised. Tom<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sang<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">most of the time, but it was chiefly nonsense, or else perhaps a strange<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">language unknown to the hobbits, an ancient language whose words were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mainly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">those of wonder and delight.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They went forward steadily, but they soon saw that the Road was further<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">away than they had imagined. Even without a fog, their sleep at mid-day<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">would have prevented them from reaching it until after nightfall on the day<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">before. The dark line they had seen was not a line of trees but a line of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">bushes growing on the edge of a deep dike with a steep wall on the further<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">side. Tom said that it had once been the boundary of a kingdom, but a very<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">long lime ago. He seemed to remember something sad about it, and would not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">say much.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They climbed down and out of the dike and through a gap in the wall,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and then Tom turned due north, for they had been bearing somewhat to the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">west. The land was now open and fairly level, and they quickened their pace,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">but the sun was already sinking low when at last they saw a line of tall<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">trees ahead, and they knew that they had come back to the Road after many<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">unexpected adventures. They galloped their ponies over the last furlongs,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and halted under the long shadows of the trees. They were on the top of a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sloping bank, and the Road, now dim as evening drew on, wound away<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">below<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">them. At this point it ran nearly from South-west to North-east, and on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">their right it fell quickly down into a wide hollow. It was rutted and bore<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">many signs of the recent heavy rain; there were pools and pot-holes full of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">water. They rode down the bank and looked up and down. There was nothing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">be seen. 'Well, here we are again at last!' said Frodo. 'I suppose we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">havenâ€™t lost more than two days by my short cut through the Forest! But<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">perhaps the delay will prove useful - it may have put them off our trail.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The others looked at him. The shadow of the fear of the Black Riders<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">came suddenly over them again. Ever since they had entered the Forest they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">had thought chiefly of getting back to the Road; only now when it lay<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">beneath their feet did they remember the danger which pursued them, and was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">more than likely to be lying in wait for them upon the Road itself. They<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">looked anxiously back towards the setting sun, but the Road was brown and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">empty.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Do you think,' asked Pippin hesitatingly, 'do you think we may be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">pursued, tonight?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'No, I hope not tonight,' answered Tom Bombadil; 'nor perhaps the next<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">day. But do not trust my guess; for I cannot tell for certain. Out east my<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">knowledge fails. Tom is not master of Riders from the Black Land far beyond<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his country.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">All the same the hobbits wished he was coming with them. They felt that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he would know how to deal with Black Riders, if anyone did. They would<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">soon<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">now be going forward into lands wholly strange to them, and beyond all but<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the most vague and distant legends of the Shire, and in the gathering<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">twilight they longed for home. A deep loneliness and sense of loss was on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">them. They stood silent, reluctant to make the final parting, and only<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">slowly became aware that Tom was wishing them farewell, and telling them to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">have good heart and to ride on till dark without halting.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™Tom will give you good advice, till this day is over (after that your<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">own luck must go with you and guide you): four miles along the Road you'll<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">come upon a village, Bree under Bree-hill, with doors looking westward.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There you'll find an old inn that is called The Prancing Pony. Barliman<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Butterbur is the worthy keeper. There you can stay the night, and afterwards<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the morning will speed you upon your way. Be bold, but wary! Keep up your<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">merry hearts, and ride to meet your fortune!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They begged him to come at least as far as the inn and drink once more<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with them; but he laughed and refused, saying:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Tom's country ends here: he will not pass the borders.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Tom has his house to mind, and Goldberry is waiting!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Then he turned, tossed up his hat, leaped on Lumpkin's back, and rode<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">up over the bank and away singing into the dusk.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The hobbits climbed up and watched him until he was out of sight.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I am sorry to take leave of Master Bombadil,' said Sam. 'He's a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">caution and no mistake. I reckon we may go a good deal further and see<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">naught better, nor queerer. But I won't deny I'll be glad to see this<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Prancing Pony he spoke of. I hope it'll be like The Green Dragon away back<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">home! What sort of folk are they in Bree?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'There are hobbits in Bree,' said Merry, 'as well as Big Folk. I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">daresay it will be homelike enough. The Pony is a good inn by all accounts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">My people ride out there now and again.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'It may be all we could wish,' said Frodo; 'but it is outside the Shire<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">all the same. Don't make yourselves too much at home ! Please remember -all<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of you - that the name of Baggins must NOT be mentioned. I am Mr. Underhill,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">if any name must be given.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They now mounted their ponies and rode off silently into the evening.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Darkness came down quickly, as they plodded slowly downhill and up again,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">until at last they saw lights twinkling some distance ahead.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Before them rose Bree-hill barring the way, a dark mass against misty<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stars; and under its western flank nestled a large village. Towards it they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">now hurried desiring only to find a fire, and a door between them and the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bree was the chief village of the Bree-land, a small inhabited region,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">like an island in the empty lands round about. Besides Bree itself, there<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was Staddle on the other side of the hill, Combe in a deep valley a little<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">further eastward, and Archet on the edge of the Chetwood. Lying round<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bree-hill and the villages was a small country of fields and tamed woodland<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">only a few miles broad.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Men of Bree were brown-haired, broad, and rather short, cheerful<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and independent: they belonged to nobody but themselves; but they were more<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">friendly and familiar with Hobbits, Dwarves, Elves, and other inhabitants of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the world about them than was (or is) usual with Big People. According to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">their own tales they were the original inhabitants and were the descendants<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of the first Men that ever wandered into the West of the middle-world. Few<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">had survived the turmoils of the Elder Days; but when the Kings returned<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">again over the Great Sea they had found the Bree-men still there, and they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were still there now, when the memory of the old Kings had faded into the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">grass.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In those days no other Men had settled dwellings so far west, or within<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a hundred leagues of the Shire. But in the wild lands beyond Bree there were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mysterious wanderers. The Bree-folk called them Rangers, and knew nothing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">their origin. They were taller and darker than the Men of Bree and were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">believed to have strange powers of sight and hearing, and to understand the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">languages of beasts and birds. They roamed at will southwards, and eastwards<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">even as far as the Misty Mountains; but they were now few and rarely seen.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">When they appeared they brought news from afar, and told strange forgotten<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">tales which were eagerly listened to; but the Bree-folk did not make friends<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There were also many families of hobbits in the Bree-land and they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">claimed to be the oldest settlement of Hobbits in the world, one that was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">founded long before even the Brandywine was crossed and the Shire colonized.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They lived mostly in Staddle though there were some in Bree itself,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">especially on the higher slopes of the hill, above the houses of the Men.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Big Folk and the Little Folk (as they called one another) were on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">friendly terms, minding their own affairs in their own ways, but both<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">rightly regarding themselves as necessary parts of the Bree-folk. Nowhere<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">else in the world was this peculiar (but excellent) arrangement to be found.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bree-folk, Big and Little, did not themselves travel much; and the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">affairs of the four villages were their chief concern. Occasionally the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Hobbits of Bree went as far as Buckland, or the Eastfarthing; but though<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">their link land was not much further than a day's riding east of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Brandywine Bridge, the Hobbits of the Shire now seldom visited it. An<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">occasional Bucklander or adventurous Took would come out to the Inn for a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">night or two, but even that was becoming less and less usual. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Shire-hobbits referred to those of Bree, and to any others that lived beyond<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the borders, as Outsiders, and took very little interest in them,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">considering them dull and uncouth. There were probably many more<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Outsiders<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">scattered about in the West of the World in those days than the people of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Shire imagined. Some, doubtless, were no better than tramps, ready to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dig a hole in any bank and stay only as long as it suited them. But in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bree-land, at any rate, the hobbits were decent and prosperous, and no more<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">rustic than most of their distant relatives Inside. It was not yet forgotten<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that there had been a time when there was much coming and going between<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Shire and Bree. There was Bree-blood in the Brandybucks by all accounts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The village of Bree had some hundred stone houses of the Big Folk,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mostly above the Road, nestling on the hillside with windows looking west.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">On that side, running in more than half a circle from the hill and back to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it, there was a deep dike with a thick hedge on the inner side. Over this<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Road crossed by a causeway; but where it pierced the hedge it was barred<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">by a great gate. There was another gate in the southern comer where the Road<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ran out of the village. The gates were closed at nightfall; but just inside<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">them were small lodges for the gatekeepers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Down on the Road, where it swept to the right to go round the foot of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the hill, there was a large inn. It had been built long ago when the traffic<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">on the roads had been far greater. For Bree stood at an old meeting of ways;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">another ancient road crossed the East Road just outside (he dike at the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">western end of the village, and in former days Men and other folk of various<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sorts had travelled much on it. Strange as News from Bree was still a saying<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in the Eastfarthing, descending from those days, when news from North,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">South, and East could be heard in the inn, and when the Shire-hobbits used<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to go more often to hear it. But the Northern Lands had long been desolate,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and the North Road was now seldom used: it was grass-grown, and the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bree-folk called it the Greenway.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Inn of Bree was still there, however, and the innkeeper was an<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">important person. His house was a meeting place for the idle, talkative, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">inquisitive among the inhabitants, large and small, of the four villages;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and a resort of Rangers and other wanderers, and for such travellers (mostly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dwarves) as still journeyed on the East Road, to and from the Mountains.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It was dark, and white stars were shining, when Frodo and his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">companions came at last to the Greenway-crossing and drew near the village.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They came to the West-gate and found it shut, but at the door of the lodge<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">beyond it, there was a man sitting. He jumped up and fetched a lantern and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">looked over the gate at them in surprise.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™What do you want, and where do you come from?' he asked gruffly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'We are making for the inn here,' answered Frodo. 'We are journeying<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">east and cannot go further tonight.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Hobbits ! Four hobbits ! And what's more, out of the Shire by their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">talk,' said the gatekeeper, softly as if speaking to himself. He stared at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">them darkly for a moment, and then slowly opened the gate and let them ride<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">through.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'We don't often see Shire-folk riding on the Road at night,' he went<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">on, as they halted a moment by his door. 'You'll pardon my wondering what<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">business takes you away east of Bree! What may your names be, might I ask?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Our names and our business are our own, and this does not seem a good<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">place to discuss them,' said Frodo, not liking the look of the man or the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">tone of his voice.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Your business is your own, no doubt,' said the man; 'but it's my<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">business to ask questions after nightfall.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'We are hobbits from Buckland, and we have a fancy to travel and to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stay at the inn here,' put in Merry. 'I am Mr. Brandybuck. Is that enough<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">for you? The Bree-folk used to be fair-spoken to travellers, or so I had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">heard.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'All right, all right!' said the man. 'I meant no offence. But you'll<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">find maybe that more folk than old Harry at the gate will be asking you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">questions. There's queer folk about. If you go on to The Pony, you'll find<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you're oat the only guests.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He wished them good night, and they said no more; but Frodo could see<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in the lantern-light that the man was still eyeing them curiously. He was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">glad to hear the gate clang to behind them, as they rode forward. He<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wondered why the man was so suspicious, and whether any one had been<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">asking<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">for news of a party of hobbits. Could it have been Gandalf? He might have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">arrived, while they were delayed in the Forest and the Downs. But there was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">something in the look and the voice of the gatekeeper that made him uneasy.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The man stared after the hobbits for a moment, and then he went back to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his house. As soon as his back was turned, a dark figure climbed quickly in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">over the gate and melted into the shadows of the village street.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The hobbits rode on up a gentle slope, passing a few detached houses,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and drew up outside the inn. The houses looked large and strange to them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sam stared up at the inn with its three storeys and many windows, and felt<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his heart sink. He had imagined himself meeting giants taller than trees,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and other creatures even more terrifying, some time or other in the course<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of his journey; but at the moment he was finding his first sight of Men and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">their tall houses quite enough, indeed too much for the dark end of a tiring<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">day. He pictured black horses standing all saddled in the shadows of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">inn-yard, and Black Riders peering out of dark upper windows.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'We surely aren't going to stay here for the night, are we, sir?' he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">exclaimed. 'If there are hobbit-folk in these pans, why don't we look for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">some that would be willing to take us in? It would be more homelike.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'What's wrong with the inn?' said Frodo. 'Tom Bombadil recommended it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I expect it's homelike enough inside.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Even from the outside the inn looked a pleasant house to familiar eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It had a front on the Road, and two wings running back on land partly cut<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">out of the lower slopes of the hill, so that at the rear the second-floor<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">windows were level with the ground. There was a wide arch leading to a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">courtyard between the two wings, and on the left under the arch there was a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">large doorway reached by a few broad steps. The door was open and light<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">streamed out of it. Above the arch there was a lamp, and beneath it swung a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">large signboard: a fat white pony reared up on its hind legs. Over the door<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was painted in white letters: THE PRANCING PONY by BARLIMAN<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">BUTTERBUR. Many<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of the lower windows showed lights behind thick curtains.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As they hesitated outside in the gloom, someone began singing a merry<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">song inside, and many cheerful voices joined loudly in the chorus. They<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">listened to this encouraging sound for a moment and then got off their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ponies. The song ended and there was a burst of laughter and clapping.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They led their ponies under the arch, and leaving them standing in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">yard they climbed up the steps. Frodo went forward and nearly bumped into a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">short fat man with a bald head and a red face. He had a white apron on, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was bustling out of one door and in through another, carrying a tray laden<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with full mugs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™Can weâ€”' began Frodo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Half a minute, if you please!' shouted the man over his shoulder, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">vanished into a babel of voices and a cloud of smoke. In a moment he was out<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">again, wiping his hands on his apron.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Good evening, little master!' he said, bending down. 'What may you be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wanting?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Beds for four, and stabling for five ponies, if that can be managed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Are you Mr. Butterbur?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'That's right! Barliman is my name. Barliman Butterbur at your service!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">You're from the Shire, eh?' he said, and then suddenly he clapped his hand<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to his forehead, as if trying to remember something. 'Hobbits!' he cried.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Now what does that remind me of? Might I ask your names, sir?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Mr. Took and Mr. Brandybuck,' said Frodo; 'and this is Sam Gamgee. My<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">name is Underhill.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'There now!' said Mr. Butterbur, snapping his fingers. 'It's gone<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">again! But it'll come back, when I have time to think. I'm run off my feet;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">but I'll see what I can do for you. We don't often get a party out of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Shire nowadays, and I should be sorry not to make you welcome. But there is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">such a crowd already in the house tonight as there hasn't been for long<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">enough. It never rains but it pours, we say in Bree.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Hi! Nob!' he shouted. 'Where are you, you woolly -footed slow-coach?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Nob!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Coming, sir! Coming!' A cheery-looking hobbit bobbed out of a door,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and seeing the travellers, stopped short and stared at them with great<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">interest.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Where's Bob?' asked the landlord. 'You don't know? Well find him!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Double sharp! I haven't got six legs, nor six eyes neither! Tell Bob there's<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">five ponies that have to be stabled. He must find room somehow.' Nob trotted<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">off with a grin and a wink.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well, now, what was I going to say?' said Mr. Butterbur, tapping his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">forehead. 'One thing drives out another, so to speak. I'm that busy tonight,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">my head is going round. There's a party that came up the Greenway from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">down<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">South last night - and that was strange enough to begin with. Then there's a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">travelling company of dwarves going West come in this evening. And now<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">there's you. If you weren't hobbits, I doubt if we could house you. But<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">we've got a room or two in the north wing that were made special for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hobbits, when this place was built. On the ground floor as they usually<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">prefer; round windows and all as they like it. I hope you'll be comfortable.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">You'll be wanting supper, I don't doubt. As soon as may be. This way now!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He led them a short way down a passage, and opened a door. 'Here is a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">nice little parlour!' he said. 'I hope it will suit. Excuse me now. I'm that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">busy. No time for talking. I must be trotting. It's hard work for two legs,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">but I don't get thinner. I'll look in again later. If you want anything,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ring the hand-bell, and Nob will come. If he don't come, ring and shout!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Off he went at last, and left them feeling rather breathless. He seemed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">capable of an endless stream of talk, however busy he might be. They found<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">themselves in a small and cosy room. There was a bit of bright fire burning<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">on the hearth, and in front of it were some low and comfortable chairs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There was a round table, already spread with a white cloth, and on it was a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">large hand-bell. But Nob, the hobbit servant, came bustling in long before<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they thought of ringing. He brought candles and a tray full of plates.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Will you be wanting anything to drink, masters?' he asked. 'And shall<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I show you the bedrooms, while your supper is got ready?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They were washed and in the middle of good deep mugs of beer when Mr.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Butterbur and Nob came in again. In a twinkling the table was laid. There<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was hot soup, cold meats, a blackberry tart, new loaves, slabs of butter,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and half a ripe cheese: good plain food, as good as the Shire could show,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and homelike enough to dispel the last of Sam's misgivings (already much<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">relieved by the excellence of the beer).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The landlord hovered round for a link, and then prepared to leave them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I don't know whether you would care to join the company, when you have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">supped,' he said, standing at the door. 'Perhaps you would rather go to your<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">beds. Still the company would be very pleased to welcome you, if you had a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mind. We don't get Outsiders - travellers from the Shire, I should say,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">begging your pardon - often; and we like to hear a bit of news, or any story<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">or song you may have in mind. But as you please! Ring the bell, if you lack<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">anything!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">So refreshed and encouraged did they feel at the end of their supper<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">(about three quarters of an hour's steady going, not hindered by unnecessary<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">talk) that Frodo, Pippin, and Sam decided to join the company. Merry said it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">would be too stuffy. 'I shall sit here quietly by the fire for a bit, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">perhaps go out later for a sniff of the air. Mind your Ps and Qs, and don't<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">forget that you are supposed to be escaping in secret, and are still on the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">high-road and not very far from the Shire!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'All right!' said Pippin. 'Mind yourself! Don't get lost, and don't<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">forget that it is safer indoors!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The company was in the big common-room of the inn. The gathering was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">large and mixed, as Frodo discovered, when his eyes got used to the light.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">This came chiefly from a blazing log-fire, for the three lamps hanging from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the beams were dim, and half veiled in smoke. Barliman Butterbur was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">standing near the fire, talking to a couple of dwarves and one or two<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">strange-looking men. On the benches were various folk: men of Bree, a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">collection of local hobbits (sitting chattering together), a few more<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dwarves, and other vague figures difficult to make out away in the shadows<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and comers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As soon as the Shire-hobbits entered, there was a chorus of welcome<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">from the Bree-landers. The strangers, especially those that had come up the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Greenway, stared at them curiously. The landlord introduced the newcomers to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Bree-folk, so quickly that, though they caught many names, they were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">seldom sure who the names belonged to. The Men of Bree seemed all to have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">rather botanical (and to the Shire-folk rather odd) names, like Rushlight,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Goatleaf, Heathertoes, Appledore, Thistlewool and Ferny (not to mention<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Butterbur). Some of the hobbits had similar names. The Mug worts, for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">instance, seemed numerous. But most of them had natural names, such as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Banks, Brockhouse, Longholes, Sandheaver, and Tunnelly, many of which<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">used in the Shire. There were several Underhills from Saddle, and as they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">could not imagine sharing a name without being related, they took Frodo to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">their hearts as a long-lost cousin.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Bree-hobbits were, in fact, friendly and inquisitive, and Frodo<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">soon found that some explanation of what he was doing would have to be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">given. He gave out that he was interested in history and geography (at which<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">there was much wagging of heads, although neither of these words were much<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">used in the Bree-dialect). He said he was thinking of writing a book (at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">which there was silent astonishment), and that he and his friends wanted to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">collect information about hobbits living outside the Shire, especially in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the eastern lands.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At this a chorus of voices broke out. If Frodo had really wanted to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">write a book, and had had many ears, he would have learned enough for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">several chapters in a few minutes. And if that was not enough, he was given<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a whole list of names, beginning with 'Old Barliman here', to whom he could<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">go for further information. But after a time, as Frodo did not show any sign<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of writing a book on the spot, the hobbits returned to their questions about<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">doings in the Shire. Frodo did not prove very communicative, and he soon<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">found himself sitting alone in a comer, listening and looking around.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Men and Dwarves were mostly talking of distant events and telling<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">flews of a kind that was becoming only too familiar. There was trouble away<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in the South, and it seemed that the Men who had come up the Greenway<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">on the move, looking for lands where they could find some peace. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bree-folk were sympathetic, but plainly not very ready to take a large<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">number of strangers into their little land. One of the travellers, a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">squint-eyed ill-favoured fellow, was foretelling that more and more people<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">would be coming north in the near future. 'If room isn't found for them,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they'll find it for themselves. They've a right to live, same as other<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">folk,' he said loudly. The local inhabitants did not look pleased at the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">prospect.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The hobbits did not pay much attention to all this, and it did not at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the moment seem to concern hobbits. Big Folk could hardly beg for lodgings<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in hobbit-holes. They were more interested in Sam and Pippin, who were now<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">feeling quite at home, and were chatting gaily about events in the Shire.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Pippin roused a good deal of laughter with an account of the collapse of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">roof of the Town Hole in Michel Delving: Will Whitfoot, the Mayor, and the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fattest hobbit in the Westfarthing, had been buried in chalk, and came out<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">like a floured dumpling. But there were several questions asked that made<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo a little uneasy. One of the Bree-landers, who seemed to have been in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Shire several times, wanted to know where the Underhills lived and who<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they were related to.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Suddenly Frodo noticed that a strange-looking weather-beaten man,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sitting in the shadows near the wall, was also listening intently to the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hobbit-talk. He had a tall tankard in front of him, and was smoking a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">long-stemmed pipe curiously carved. His legs were stretched out before him,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">showing high boots of supple leather that fitted him well, but had seen much<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wear and were now caked with mud. A travel -stained cloak of heavy dark-<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">green<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">cloth was drawn close about him, and in spite of the heat of the room he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wore a hood that overshadowed his face; but the gleam of his eyes could be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">seen as he watched the hobbits.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™Who is that?' Frodo asked, when he got a chance to whisper to Mr.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Butterbur. 'I don't think you introduced him?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Him?' said the landlord in an answering whisper, cocking an eye<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">without turning his head. 'I don't rightly know. He is one of the wandering<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">folk -Rangers we call them. He seldom talks: not but what he can tell a rare<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">tale when he has the mind. He disappears for a month, or a year, and then he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">pops up again. He was in and out pretty often last spring; but I haven't<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">seen him about lately. What his right name is I've never heard: but he's<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">known round here as Strider. Goes about at a great pace on his long shanks;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">though he don't tell nobody what cause he has to hurry. But there's no<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">accounting for East and West, as we say in Bree, meaning the Rangers and the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Shire-folk, begging your pardon. Funny you should ask about him.' But at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that moment Mr. Butterbur was called away by a demand for more ale and his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">last remark remained unexplained.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo found that Strider was now looking at him, as if he had heard or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">guessed all that had been said. Presently, with a wave of his hand and a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">nod, he invited Frodo to come over and sit by him. As Frodo drew near be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">threw back his hood, showing a shaggy head of dark hair necked with grey,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and in a pale stem face a pair of keen grey eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I am called Strider,' he said in a low voice. 'I am very pleased to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">meet you. Master - Underhill, if old Butterbur got your name right.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'He did,' said Frodo stiffly. He felt far from comfortable under the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stare of those keen eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well, Master Underhill,' said Strider, 'if I were you, I should stop<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">your young friends from talking too much. Drink, fire, and chance -meeting<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">are pleasant enough, but, well - this isn't the Shire. There are queer folk<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">about. Though I say it as shouldn't, you may think,' he added with a wry<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">smile, seeing Frodo's glance. 'And there have been even stranger travellers<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">through Bree lately,' he went on, watching Frodo's face.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo returned his gaze but said nothing; and Strider made no further<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sign. His attention seemed suddenly to be fixed on Pippin. To his alarm<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo became aware that the ridiculous young Took, encouraged by his success<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with the fat Mayor of Michel Delving, was now actually giving a comic<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">account of Bilbo's farewell party. He was already giving an imitation of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Speech, and was drawing near to the astonishing Disappearance.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo was annoyed. It was a harmless enough tale for most of the local<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hobbits, no doubt: just a funny story about those funny people away beyond<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the River; but some (old Butterbur, for instance) knew a thing or two, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">had probably heard rumours long ago about Bilbo's vanishing. It would bring<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the name of Baggins to their minds, especially if there had been inquiries<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in Bree after that name.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo fidgeted, wondering what to do. Pippin was evidently much<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">enjoying the attention he was getting, and had become quite forgetful of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">their danger. Frodo had a sudden fear that in his present mood he might even<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mention the Ring; and that might well be disastrous.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You had better do something quick!' whispered Strider in his ear.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo jumped up and stood on a table, and began to talk. The attention<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of Pippin's audience was disturbed. Some of the hobbits looked at Frodo and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">laughed and clapped, thinking that Mr. Underhill had taken as much ale as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was good for him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo suddenly felt very foolish, and found himself (as was his habit<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">when making a speech) fingering the things in his pocket. He felt the Ring<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">on its chain, and quite unaccountably the desire came over him to slip it on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and vanish out of the silly situation. It seemed to him, somehow, as if me<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">suggestion came to him from outside, from someone or something a the room.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He resisted the temptation firmly, and clasped the Ring in his hand, as if<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to keep a hold on it and prevent it from escaping or doing any mischief. At<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">any rate it gave him no inspiration. He spoke 'a few suitable words', as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they would have said in the Shire: We are all very much gratified by the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">kindness of your reception, and I venture to hope that my brief visit will<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">help to renew the old ties of friendship between the Shire and Bree; and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">then he hesitated and coughed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Everyone in the room was now looking at him. 'A song!' shouted one of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the hobbits. 'A song! A song!' shouted all the others. 'Come on now, master,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sing us something that we havenâ€™t heard before!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For a moment Frodo stood gaping. Then in desperation he began a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ridiculous song that Bilbo had been rather fond of (and indeed rather proud<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of, for he had made up the words himself). It was about an inn; and that is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">probably why it came into Frodo's mind just then. Here it is in full. Only a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">few words of it are now, as a rule, remembered.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There is an inn, a merry old inn<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">beneath an old grey hill,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And there they brew a beer so brown<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">That the Man in the Moon himself came down<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">one night to drink his fill.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The ostler has a tipsy cat<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that plays a five-stringed fiddle;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And up and down he runs his bow,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Now squeaking high, now purring low,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">now sawing in the middle.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The landlord keeps a little dog<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that is mighty fond of jokes;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">When there's good cheer among the guests,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He cocks an ear at all the jests<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and laughs until he chokes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They also keep a horned cow<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">as proud as any queen;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But music turns her head like ale,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And makes her wave her tufted tail<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and dance upon the green.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And O! the rows of silver dishes<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and the store of silver spoons!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For Sunday* there's a special pair,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And these they polish up with care<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">on Saturday afternoons.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Man in the Moon was drinking deep,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and the cat began to wail;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A dish and a spoon on the table danced,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The cow in the garden madly pranced,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and the little dog chased his tail.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Man in the Moon took another mug,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and then rolled beneath his chair;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And there he dozed and dreamed of ale,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Till in the sky the stars were pale,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and dawn was in the air.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Then the ostler said to his tipsy cat:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'The white horses of the Moon,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They neigh and champ their silver bits;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But their master's been and drowned his wits,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and the Sun'll be rising soon!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">So the cat on his fiddle played hey-diddle-diddle,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a jig that would wake the dead:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He squeaked and sawed and quickened the tune,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">While the landlord shook the Man in the Moon:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'It's after three!' he said.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They rolled the Man slowly up the hill<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and bundled him into the Moon,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">While his horses galloped up in rear,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And the cow came capering like a deer,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and a dish ran up with the spoon.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Now quicker the fiddle went deedle-dum-diddle;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the dog began to roar,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The cow and the horses stood on their heads;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The guests all bounded from their beds<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and danced upon the floor.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">With a ping and a pong the fiddle-strings broke!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the cow jumped over the Moon,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And the little dog laughed to see such fun,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And the Saturday dish went off at a run<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with the silver Sunday spoon.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The round Moon rolled behind the hill<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">as the Sun raised up her head.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">She * hardly believed her fiery eyes;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For though it was day, to her surprise<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they all went back to bed!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There was loud and long applause. Frodo had a good voice, and the song<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">tickled their fancy. 'Where's old Barley?' they cried. 'He ought to hear<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">this. Bob ought to learn his cat the fiddle, and then we'd have a dance.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They called for more ale, and began to shout: 'Let's have it again, master!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Come on now! Once more!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They made Frodo have another drink, and then begin his song again,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">while many of them joined in; for the tune was well known, and they were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">quick at picking up words. It was now Frodo's turn to feel pleased with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">himself. He capered about on the table; and when he came a second time to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the cow jumped over the Moon, he leaped in the air. Much too vigorously; for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he came down, bang, into a tray full of mugs, and slipped, and rolled off<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the table with a crash, clatter, and bump! The audience all opened their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mouths wide for laughter, and stopped short a gaping silence; for the singer<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">disappeared. He simply vanished, as if he had gone slap through the floor<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">without leaving a hole !<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The local hobbits stared in amazement, and then sprang to their feet<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and shouted for Barliman. All the company drew away from Pippin and Sam,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">who<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">found themselves left alone in a comer, and eyed darkly and doubtfully from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a distance. It was plain that many people regarded them now as the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">companions of a travelling magician of unknown powers and purpose. But<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">there<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was one swarthy Bree-lander, who stood looking at them with a knowing and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">half-mocking expression that made them feel very uncomfortable. Presently he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">slipped out of the door, followed by the squint-eyed southerner: the two had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">been whispering together a good deal during the evening. Harry the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">gatekeeper also went out just behind them..<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo felt a fool. Not knowing what else to do, he crawled away under<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the tables to the dark comer by Strider, who sat unmoved, giving no sign of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his thoughts. Frodo leaned back against the wall and took off the Ring. How<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it came to be on his finger he could not tell. He could only suppose that he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">had been handling it in his pocket while he sang, and that somehow it had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">slipped on when he stuck out his hand with a jerk to save his fall. For a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">moment he wondered if the Ring itself had not played him a trick; perhaps it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">had tried to reveal itself in response to some wish or command that was felt<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in the room. He did not like the looks of the men that had gone out.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well?' said Strider, when he reappeared. â€™Why did you do that? Worse<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">than anything your friends could have said! You have put your foot in it! Or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">should I say your finger?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I don't know what you mean,' said Frodo, annoyed and alarmed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Oh yes, you do,' answered Strider; 'but we had better wait until the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">uproar has died down. Then, if you please, Mr. Baggins, I should like a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">quiet word with you.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'What about?' asked Frodo, ignoring the sudden use of his proper name.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'A matter of some importance - to us both,' answered Strider, looking<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo in the eye. 'You may hear something to your advantage.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Very well,' said Frodo, trying to appear unconcerned. 'I'll talk to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you later.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Meanwhile an argument was going on by the fireplace. Mr. Butterbur had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">come trotting in, and he was now trying to listen to several conflicting<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">accounts of the event at the same time.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I saw him, Mr. Butterbur,' said a hobbit; 'or leastways I didn't see<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">him, if you take my meaning. He just vanished into thin air, in a manner of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">speaking.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You don't say, Mr. Mugwort!' said the landlord, looking puzzled.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Yes I do!' replied Mugwort. 'And I mean what I say, what's more.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'There's some mistake somewhere,' said Butterbur, shaking his head.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There was too much of that Mr. Underhill to go vanishing into thin air; or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">into thick air, as is more likely in this room.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well, where is he now?' cried several voices.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'How should I know? He's welcome to go where he will, so long as he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">pays in the morning. There's Mr. Took, now: he's not vanished.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well, I saw what I saw, and I saw what I didn't,' said Mugwort<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">obstinately.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'And I say there's some mistake,' repeated Butterbur, picking up the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">tray and gathering up the broken crockery.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Of course there's a mistake!' said Frodo. 'I haven't vanished. Here I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">am! I've just been having a few words with Strider in the comer.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He came forward into the firelight; but most of the company backed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">away,, even more perturbed than before. They were not in the least satisfied<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">by his explanation that he had crawled away quickly under the tables after<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he had fallen. Most of the Hobbits and the Men of Bree went off then and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">there in a huff, having no fancy for further entertainment that evening. One<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">or two gave Frodo a black look and departed muttering among themselves.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Dwarves and the two or three strange Men that still remained got up and said<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">good night to the landlord, but not to Frodo and his friends. Before long no<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">one was left but Strider, who sat on, unnoticed, by the wall.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mr. Butterbur did not seem much put out. He reckoned, very probably,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that his house would be full again on many future nights, until the present<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mystery had been thoroughly discussed. 'Now what have you been doing, Mr.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Underhill?' he asked. 'Frightening my customers and breaking up my crocks<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with your acrobatics!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I am very sorry to have caused any trouble,' said Frodo. 'It was quite<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">unintentional, I assure you. A most unfortunate accident.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'All right, Mr. Underhill! But if you're going to do any more tumbling,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">or conjuring, or whatever it was, you'd best warn folk beforehand - and warn<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">me. We're a bit suspicious round here of anything out of the way -uncanny,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">if you understand me; and we don't take to it all of a sudden.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I shan't be doing anything of the sort again, Mr. Butterbur, I promise<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you. And now I think I'll be getting to bed. We shall be making an early<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">start. Will you see that our ponies are ready by eight o'clock?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Very good! But before you go, I should like a word with you in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">private, Mr. Underhill. Something has just come back to my mind that I ought<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to tell you. I hope that you'll not take it amiss. When I've seen to a thing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">or two, I'll come along to your room, if you're willing.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Certainly!' said Frodo; but his heart sank. He wondered how many<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">private talks he would have before he got to bed, and what they would<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">reveal. Were these people all in league against him? He began to suspect<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">even old Butterbur's fat face of concealing dark designs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Chapter 10. Strider<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo, Pippin, and Sam made their way back to the parlour. There was no<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">light. Merry was not there, and the fire had burned low. It was not until<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they had puffed up the embers into a blaze and thrown on a couple of faggots<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that they discovered Strider had come with them. There he was calmly sitting<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in a chair by the door!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Hallo!' said Pippin. 'Who are you, and what do you want?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I am called Strider,' he answered: 'and though he may have forgotten<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it, your friend promised to have a quiet talk with me.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You said I might hear something to my advantage, I believe,' said<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo. 'What have you to say?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Several things,' answered Strider. 'But, of course, I have my price.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'What do you mean?' asked Frodo sharply.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Don't be alarmed! I mean just this: I will tell you what I know, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">give you some good advice - but I shall want a reward.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'And what will that be, pray?' said Frodo. He suspected now that he had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fallen in with a rascal, and he thought uncomfortably that he had brought<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">only a little money with him. All of it would hardly satisfy a rogue, and he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">could not spare any of it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'No more than you can afford,' answered Strider with a slow smile, as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">if he guessed Frodo's thoughts. 'Just this: you must take me along with you,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">until I wish to leave you.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Oh, indeed!' replied Frodo, surprised, but not much relieved. 'Even if<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I wanted another companion, I should not agree to any such thing, until I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">knew a good deal more about you, and your business.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Excellent!' exclaimed Strider, crossing his legs and sitting back<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">comfortably. 'You seem to be coming to your senses again, and that is all to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the good. You have been much too careless so far. Very well! I will tell you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">what I know, and leave the reward to you. You may be glad to grant it, when<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you have heard me.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Go on then!' said Frodo. 'What do you know?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Too much; too many dark things,' said Strider grimly. 'But as for your<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">business â€” ' He got up and went to the door, opened it quickly and looked<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">out. Then he shut it quietly and sat down again. 'I have quick ears,' he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">went on, lowering his voice, 'and though I cannot disappear, I have hunted<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">many wild and wary things and I can usually avoid being seen, if I wish.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Now, I was behind the hedge this evening on the Road west of Bree, when four<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hobbits came out of the Downlands. I need not repeat all that they said to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">old Bombadil or to one another, but one thing interested me. Please<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">remember, said one of them, that the name Baggins must not be mentioned. I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">am Mr. Underhill, if any name must be given. That interested me so much that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I followed them here. I slipped over the gate just behind them. Maybe Mr.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Baggins has an honest reason for leaving his name behind; but if so, I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">should advise him and his friends to be more careful.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I don't see what interest my name has for any one in Bree,' said Frodo<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">angrily, 'and I have still to learn why it interests you. Mr. Strider may<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">have an honest reason for spying and eavesdropping; but if so, I should<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">advise him to explain it.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well answered!' said Strider laughing. 'But the explanation is simple:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I was looking for a Hobbit called Frodo Baggins. I wanted to find him<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">quickly. I had learned that he was carrying out of the Shire, well, a secret<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that concerned me and my friends.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Now, don't mistake me!' he cried, as Frodo rose from his seat, and Sam<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">jumped up with a scowl. 'I shall take more care of the secret than you do.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And care is needed!' He leaned forward and looked at them. 'Watch every<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shadow!' he said in a low voice. 'Black horsemen have passed through Bree.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">On Monday one came down the Greenway, they say; and another appeared<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">later,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">coming up the Greenway from the south.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There was a silence. At last Frodo spoke to Pippin and Sam: 'I ought to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">have guessed it from the way the gatekeeper greeted us,' he said. 'And the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">landlord seems to have heard something. Why did he press us to join the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">company? And why on earth did we behave so foolishly: we ought to have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stayed quiet in here.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'It would have been better,' said Strider. 'I would have stopped your<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">going into the common-room, if I could; but the innkeeper would not let me<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in to see you, or take a message.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Do you think he ' began Frodo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'No, I don't think any harm of old Butterbur. Only he does not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">altogether like mysterious vagabonds of my sort.' Frodo gave him a puzzled<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">look. 'Well, I have rather a rascally look, have I not?' said Strider with a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">curl of his lip and a queer gleam in his eye. 'But I hope we shall get to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">know one another better. When we do, I hope you will explain what happened<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">at the end of your song. For that little prank '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'It was sheer accident!' interrupted Frodo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I wonder,' said Strider. 'Accident, then. That accident has made your<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">position dangerous.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Hardly more than it was already,' said Frodo. 'I knew these horsemen<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were pursuing me; but now at any rate they seem to have missed me and to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">have gone away.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You must not count on that!' said Strider sharply. 'They will return.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And more are coming. There are others. I know their number. I know these<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Riders.' He paused, and his eyes were cold and hard. 'And there are some<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">folk in Bree who are not to be trusted,' he went on. 'Bill Ferny, for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">instance. He has an evil name in the Bree-land, and queer folk call at his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">house. You must have noticed him among the company: a swarthy sneering<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fellow. He was very close with one of the Southern strangers, and they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">slipped out together just after your "accident". Not all of those<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Southerners mean well; and as for Ferny, he would sell anything to anybody;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">or make mischief for amusement.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'What will Ferny sell, and what has my accident got to do with him?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">said Frodo, still determined not to understand Strider's hints.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'News of you, of course,' answered Strider. 'An account of your<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">performance would be very interesting to certain people. After that they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">would hardly need to be told your real name. It seems to me only too likely<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that they will hear of it before this night is over. Is that enough? You can<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">do as you like about my reward: take me as a guide or not. But I may say<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that I know all the lands between the Shire and the Misty Mountains, for I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">have wandered over them for many years. I am older than I look. I might<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">prove useful. You will have to leave the open road after tonight; for the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">horsemen will watch it night and day. You may escape from Bree, and be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">allowed to go forward while the Sun is up; but you won't go far. They will<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">come on you in the wild, in some dark place where there is no help. Do you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wish them to find you? They are terrible!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The hobbits looked at him, and saw with surprise that his face was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">drawn as if with pain, and his hands clenched the arms of his chair. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">room was very quiet and still, and the light seemed to have grown dim. For a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">while he sat with unseeing eyes as if walking in distant memory or listening<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to sounds in the Night far away.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'There!' he cried after a moment, drawing his hand across his brow.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Perhaps I know more about these pursuers than you do. You fear them, but<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you do not fear them enough, yet. Tomorrow you will have to escape, if you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">can. Strider can take you by paths that are seldom trodden. Will you have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">him?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There was a heavy silence. Frodo made no answer, his mind was confused<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with doubt and fear. Sam frowned, and looked at his master; and at last he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">broke out:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'With your leave, Mr. Frodo, I'd say no! This Strider here, he warns<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and he says take care; and I say yes to that, and let's begin with him. He<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">comes out of the Wild, and I never heard no good of such folk. He knows<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">something, that's plain, and more than I like; but it's no reason why we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">should let him go leading us out into some dark place far from help, as he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">puts it.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Pippin fidgeted and looked uncomfortable. Strider did not reply to Sam,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">but turned his keen eyes on Frodo. Frodo caught his glance and looked away.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'No,' he said slowly. 'I don't agree. I think, I think you are not really as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you choose to look. You began to talk to me like the Bree-folk, but your<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">voice has changed. Still Sam seems right in this: I don't see why you should<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">warn us to take care, and yet ask us to take you on trust. Why the disguise?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Who are you? What do you really know about - about my business; and how<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">do<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you know it?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'The lesson in caution has been well learned,' said Strider with a grim<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">smile. 'But caution is one thing and wavering is another. You will never get<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to Rivendell now on your own, and to trust me is your only chance. You must<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">make up your mind. I will answer some of your questions, if that will help<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you to do so. But why should you believe my story, if you do not trust me<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">already? Still here it is '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At that moment there came a knock at the door. Mr. Butterbur had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">arrived with candles, and behind him was Nob with cans of hot water. Strider<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">withdrew into a dark corner.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I've come to bid you good night,' said the landlord, putting the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">candles on the table. 'Nob! Take the water to the rooms!' He came in and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shut the door.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'It's like this,' he began, hesitating and looking troubled. 'If I've<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">done any harm, I'm sorry indeed. But one thing drives out another, as you'll<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">admit; and I'm a busy man. But first one thing and then another this week<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">have jogged my memory, as the saying goes; and not too late I hope. You see,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I was asked to look out for hobbits of the Shire, and for one by the name of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Baggins in particular.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'And what has that got to do with me?' asked Frodo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Ah! you know best,' said the landlord, knowingly. 'I won't give you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">away; but I was told that this Baggins would be going by the name of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Underhill, and I was given a description that fits you well enough, if I may<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">say so.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Indeed! Let's have it then!' said Frodo, unwisely interrupting.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'A stout little fellow with red cheeks, ' said Mr. Butterbur solemnly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Pippin chuckled, but Sam looked indignant. 'That won't help you much; it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">goes for most hobbits. Barley, he says to me,' continued Mr. Butterbur with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a glance at Pippin. 'But this one is taller than some and fairer than most,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and he has a cleft in his chin: perky chap with a bright eye. Begging your<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">pardon, but he said it, not me.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'He said it? And who was he?' asked Frodo eagerly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Ah! That was Gandalf, if you know who I mean. A wizard they say he is,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">but he's a good friend of mine, whether or no. But now I don't know what<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he'll have to say to me, if I see him again: turn all my ale sour or me into<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a block of wood, I shouldn't wonder. He's a bit hasty. Still what's done<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">can't be undone. '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well, what have you done?' said Frodo, getting impatient with the slow<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">unravelling of Butterbur's thoughts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Where was I?' said the landlord, pausing and snapping his fingers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Ah, yes ! Old Gandalf. Three months back he walked right into my room<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">without a knock. Barley, he says, I'm off in the morning. Will you do<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">something for me? You've only to name it, I said. I'm in a hurry, said he,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and I've no time myself, but I want a message took to the Shire. Have you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">anyone you can send, and trust to go? I can find someone, I said, tomorrow,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">maybe, or the day after. Make it tomorrow, he says, and then he gave me a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">letter.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'It's addressed plain enough,' said Mr. Butterbur, producing a letter<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">from his pocket, and reading out the address slowly and proudly (he valued<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his reputation as a lettered man):<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mr FRODO BAGGINS, BAG END, HOBBITON in the SHIRE.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'A letter for me from Gandalf!' cried Frodo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Ah!' said Mr. Butterbur. 'Then your right name is Baggins?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'It is,' said Frodo, 'and you had better give me that letter at once,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and explain why you never sent it. That's what you came to tell me, I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">suppose, though you've taken a long time to come to the point.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Poor Mr. Butterbur looked troubled. 'You're right, master,' he said,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'and I beg your pardon. And I'm mortal afraid of what Gandalf will say, if<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">harm comes of it. But I didn't keep it back a-purpose. I put it by safe.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Then I couldn't find nobody willing to go to the Shire next day, nor the day<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">after, and none of my own folk were to spare; and then one thing after<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">another drove it out of my mind. I'm a busy man. I'll do what I can to set<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">matters right, and if there's any help I can give, you've only to name it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Leaving the letter aside, I promised Gandalf no less. Barley, he says<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to me, this friend of mine from the Shire, he may be coming out this way<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">before long, him and another. He'll be calling himself Underhill. Mind that!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But you need ask no questions. And if I'm not with him, he may be in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">trouble, and he may need help. Do whatever you can for him, and I'll be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">grateful, he says. And here you are, and trouble is not far off, seemingly.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'What do you mean?' asked Frodo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'These black men,' said the landlord lowering his voice. 'They're<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">looking for Baggins, and if they mean well, then I'm a hobbit. It was on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Monday, and all the dogs were yammering and the geese screaming. Uncanny,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">called it. Nob, he came and told me that two black men were at the door<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">asking for a hobbit called Baggins. Nob's hair was all stood on end. I bid<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the black fellows be off, and slammed the door on them; but they've been<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">asking the same question all the way to Archet, I hear. And that Ranger,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Strider, he's been asking questions, too. Tried to get in here to see you,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">before you'd had bite or sup, he did.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Fie did!' said Strider suddenly, coming forward into the light. 'And<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">much trouble would have been saved, if you had let him in, Barliman.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The landlord jumped with surprise. 'You!' he cried. 'You're always<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">popping up. What do you want now?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'He's here with my leave,' said Frodo. 'He came to offer me his help.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well, you know your own business, maybe,' said Mr. Butterbur, looking<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">suspiciously at Strider. 'But if I was in your plight, I wouldn't take up<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with a Ranger.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Then who would you take up with?' asked Strider. 'A fat innkeeper who<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">only remembers his own name because people shout it at him all day? They<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">cannot stay in The Pony for ever, and they cannot go home. They have a long<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">road before them. Will you go with them and keep the black men off?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Me? Leave Bree! I wouldn't do that for any money,' said Mr. Butterbur,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">looking really scared. 'But why can't you stay here quiet for a bit, Mr.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Underhill? What are all these queer goings on? What are these black men<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">after, and where do they come from, I'd like to know?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I'm sorry I can't explain it all,' answered Frodo. 'I am tired and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">very worried, and it's a long tale. But if you mean to help me, I ought to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">warn you that you will be in danger as long as I am in your house. These<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Black Riders: I am not sure, but I think, I fear they come from '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'They come from Mordor,' said Strider in a low voice. 'From Mordor,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Barliman, if that means anything to you.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Save us!' cried Mr. Butterbur turning pale; the name evidently was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">known to him. 'That is the worst news that has come to Bree in my time.' 'It<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">is,' said Frodo. 'Are you still willing to help me?' 'I am,' said Mr.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Butterbur. 'More than ever. Though I don't know what the likes of me can do<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">against, against ' he faltered.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Against the Shadow in the East,' said Strider quietly. 'Not much,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Barliman, but every little helps. You can let Mr. Underhill stay here<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">tonight, as Mr. Underhill, and you can forget the name of Baggins, till he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">is far away.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I'll do that,' said Butterbur. 'But they'll find out he's here without<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">help from me, I'm afraid. It's a pity Mr. Baggins drew attention to himself<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">this evening, to say no more. The story of that Mr. Bilbo's going off has<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">been heard before tonight in Bree. Even our Nob has been doing some guessing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in his slow pate: and there are others in Bree quicker in the uptake than he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">is.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well, we can only hope the Riders won't come back yet,' said Frodo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I hope not, indeed,' said Butterbur. 'But spooks or no spooks, they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">won't get in The Pony so easy. Don't you worry till the morning. Nob'll say<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">no word. No black man shall pass my doors, while I can stand on my legs. Me<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and my folk'll keep watch tonight; but you had best get some sleep, if you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">can.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'In any case we must be called at dawn,' said Frodo. 'We must get off<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">as early as possible. Breakfast at six-thirty, please.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Right! I'll see to the orders,' said the landlord. 'Good night, Mr.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Baggins - Underhill, I should say! Good night - now, bless me! Where's your<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mr. Brandybuck?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I donâ€™t know,' said Frodo with sudden anxiety. They had forgotten all<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">about Merry, and it was getting late. 'I am afraid he is out. He said<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">something about going for a breath of air.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well, you do want looking after and no mistake: your party might be on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a holiday!' said Butterbur. 'I must go and bar the doors quick, but I'll see<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">your friend is let in when he comes. I'd better send Nob to look for him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Good night to you all!' At last Mr. Butterbur went out, with another<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">doubtful look at Strider and a shake of his head. His footsteps retreated<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">down the passage.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well?' said Strider. 'When are you going to open that letter?' Frodo<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">looked carefully at the seal before he broke it. It seemed certainly to be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gandalf s. Inside, written in the wizard's strong but graceful script, was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bad news has reached me here. I must go off at once. You had better<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sure of you. The Enemy has set traps for me before now. As soon as I had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">made up my mind, I was ready to tell you whatever you asked. But I must<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">admit,' he added with a queer laugh, 'that I hoped you would take to me for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">my own sake. A hunted man sometimes wearies of distrust and longs for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">friendship. But there, I believe my looks are against me.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'They are - at first sight at any rate,' laughed Pippin with sudden<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">relief after reading Gandalf's letter. 'But handsome is as handsome does, as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">we say in the Shire; and I daresay we shall all look much the same after<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">lying for days in hedges and ditches.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'It would take more than a few days, or weeks, or years, of wandering<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in the Wild to make you look like Strider,' he answered. 'And you would die<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">first, unless you are made of sterner stuff than you look to be.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Pippin subsided; but Sam was not daunted, and he still eyed Strider<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dubiously. 'How do we know you are the Strider that Gandalf speaks about?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he demanded. 'You never mentioned Gandalf, till this letter came out. You<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">might be a play-acting spy, for all I can see, trying to get us to go with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you. You might have done in the real Strider and took his clothes. What have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you to say to that?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'That you are a stout fellow,' answered Strider; 'but I am afraid my<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">only answer to you, Sam Gamgee, is this. If I had killed the real Strider, I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">could kill you. And I should have killed you already without so much talk.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">If I was after the Ring, I could have it - NOW!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He stood up, and seemed suddenly to grow taller. In his eyes gleamed a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">light, keen and commanding. Throwing back his cloak, he laid his hand on the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hilt of a sword that had hung concealed by his side. They did not dare to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">move. Sam sat wide-mouthed staring at him dumbly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'But I am the real Strider, fortunately,' he said, looking down at them<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with his face softened by a sudden smile. 'I am Aragorn son of Arathorn; and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">if by life or death I can save you, I will.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There was a long silence. At last Frodo spoke with hesitation. 'I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">believed that you were a friend before the letter came,' he said, 'or at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">least I wished to. You have frightened me several times tonight, but never<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in the way that servants of the Enemy would, or so I imagine. I think one of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his spies would - well, seem fairer and feel fouler, if you understand.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I see,' laughed Strider. 'I look foul and feel fair. Is that it? All<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that is gold does not glitter, not all those who wander are lost '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Did the verses apply to you then?' asked Frodo. 'I could not make out<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">what they were about. But how did you know that they were in Gandalf s<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">letter, if you have never seen it?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I did not know,' he answered. 'But I am Aragorn, and those verses go<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with that name.' He drew out his sword, and they saw that the blade was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">indeed broken a foot below the hilt. 'Not much use is it, Sam?' said<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Strider. 'But the time is near when it shall be forged anew.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sam said nothing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well,' said Strider, 'with Sam's permission we will call that settled.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Strider shall be your guide. We shall have a rough road tomorrow. Even if we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">are allowed to leave Bree unhindered, we can hardly hope now to leave it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">unnoticed. But I shall try to get lost as soon as possible. I know one or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">two ways out of Bree-land other than the main road. If once we shake off the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">pursuit, I shall make for Weathertop.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Weathertop?' said Sam. 'What's that?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'It is a hill, just to the north of the Road, about half way from here<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to Rivendell. It commands a wide view all round; and there we shall have a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">chance to look about us. Gandalf will make for that point, if he follows us.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After Weathertop our journey will become more difficult, and we shall have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to choose between various dangers.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™When did you last see Gandalf?' asked Frodo. 'Do you know where he is,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">or what he is doing?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Strider looked grave. 'I do not know,' he said. 'I came west with him<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in the spring. I have often kept watch on the borders of the Shire in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">last few years, when he was busy elsewhere. He seldom left it unguarded. We<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">last met on the first of May: at Sam Ford down the Brandywine. He told me<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that his business with you had gone well, and that you would be starting for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Rivendell in the last week of September. As I knew he was at your side, I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">went away on a journey of my own. And that has proved ill; for plainly some<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">news reached him, and I was not at hand to help.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I am troubled, for the first time since I have known him. We should<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">have had messages, even if he could not come himself. When I returned, many<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">days ago, I heard the ill news. The tidings had gone far and wide that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gandalf was missing and the horsemen had been seen. It was the Elven-folk of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gildor that told me this; and later they told me that you had left your<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">home; but there was no news of your leaving Buckland. I have been watching<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the East Road anxiously.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Do you think the Black Riders have anything to do with it - with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gandalf's absence, I mean?' asked Frodo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I do not know of anything else that could have hindered him, except<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Enemy himself,' said Strider. 'But do not give up hope ! Gandalf is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">greater than you Shire-folk know - as a rule you can only see his jokes and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">toys. But this business of ours will be his greatest task.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Pippin yawned. 'I am sorry,' he said, 'but I am dead tired. In spite of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">all the danger and worry I must go to bed, or sleep where I sit. Where is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that silly fellow, Merry? It would be the last straw, if we had to go out in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the dark to look for him.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At that moment they heard a door slam; then feet came running along the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">passage. Merry came in with a rush followed by Nob. He shut the door<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hastily, and leaned against it. He was out of breath. They stared at him in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">alarm for a moment before he gasped: 'I have seen them, Frodo! I have seen<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">them! Black Riders!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Black Riders!' cried Frodo. 'Where?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Here. In the village. I stayed indoors for an hour. Then as you did<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">not come back, I went out for a stroll. I had come back again and was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">standing just outside the light of the lamp looking at the stars. Suddenly I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shivered and felt that something horrible was creeping near: there was a son<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of deeper shade among the shadows across the road, just beyond the edge of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the lamplight. It slid away at once into the dark without a sound. There was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">no horse.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Which way did it go?' asked Strider, suddenly and sharply. Merry<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">started, noticing the stranger for the first time. 'Go on!' said Frodo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'This is a friend of Gandalf's. I will explain later.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'It seemed to make off up the Road, eastward,' continued Merry. 'I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">tried to follow. Of course, it vanished almost at once; but I went round the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">corner and on as far as the last house on the Road.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Strider looked at Merry with wonder. 'You have a stout heart,' he said;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'but it was foolish.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I don't know,' said Merry. 'Neither brave nor silly, I think. I could<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hardly help myself. I seemed to be drawn somehow. Anyway, I went, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">suddenly I heard voices by the hedge. One was muttering; and the other was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">whispering, or hissing. I couldn't hear a word that was said. I did not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">creep any closer, because I began to tremble all over. Then I felt<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">terrified, and I turned back, and was just going to bolt home, when<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">something came behind me and I... I fell over.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I found him, sir,' put in Nob. 'Mr. Butterbur sent me out with a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">lantern. I went down to West-gate, and then back up towards South-gate. Just<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">nigh Bill Ferny's house I thought I could see something in the Road. I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">couldn't swear to it, but it looked to me as if two men was stooping over<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">something, lilting it. I gave a shout, but where I got up to the spot there<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was no signs of them, and only Mr. Brandybuck lying by the roadside. He<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">seemed to be asleep. "I thought I had fallen into deep water," he says to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">me, when I shook him. Very queer he was, and as soon as I had roused him, he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">got up and ran back here like a hare.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I am afraid that's true,' said Merry, 'though I don't know what I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">said. I had an ugly dream, which I can't remember. I went to pieces. I don't<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">know what came over me.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I do,' said Strider. 'The Black Breath. The Riders must have left<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">their horses outside, and passed back through the South-gate in secret. They<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">will know all the news now, for they have visited Bill Ferny; and probably<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that Southerner was a spy as well. Something may happen in the night, before<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">we leave Bree.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'What will happen?' said Merry. 'Will they attack the inn?' 'No, I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">think not,' said Strider. 'They are not all here yet. And in any case that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">is not their way. In dark and loneliness they are strongest; they will not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">openly attack a house where there are lights and many people -not until they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">are desperate, not while all the long leagues of Eriador still lie before<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">us. But their power is in terror, and already some in Bree are in their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">clutch. They will drive these wretches to some evil work: Ferny, and some of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the strangers, and, maybe, the gatekeeper too. They had words with Harry at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">West-gate on Monday. I was watching them. He was white and shaking when<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">left him.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'We seem to have enemies all round,' said Frodo. 'What are we to do?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Stay here, and do not go to your rooms ! They are sure to have found<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">out which those are. The hobbit-rooms have windows looking north and close<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to the ground. We will all remain together and bar this window and the door.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But first Nob and I will fetch your luggage.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">While Strider was gone, Frodo gave Merry a rapid account of all that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">had happened since supper. Merry was still reading and pondering Gandalf's<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">letter when Strider and Nob returned.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well Masters,' said Nob, 'I've ruffled up the clothes and put in a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">bolster down the middle of each bed. And I made a nice imitation of your<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">head with a brown woollen mat, Mr. Bag - Underhill, sir,' he added with a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">grin.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Pippin laughed. 'Very life-like!' he said. 'But what will happen when<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they have penetrated the disguise?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'We shall see,' said Strider. 'Fet us hope to hold the fort till<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">morning.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Good night to you,' said Nob, and went off to take his part in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">watch on the doors.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Their bags and gear they piled on the parlour-floor. They pushed a low<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">chair against the door and shut the window. Peering out, Frodo saw that the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">night was still clear. The Sickle was swinging bright above the shoulders of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bree-hill. He then closed and barred the heavy inside shutters and drew the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">curtains together. Strider built up the fire and blew out all the candles.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The hobbits lay down on their blankets with their feet towards the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hearth; but Strider settled himself in the chair against the door. They<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">talked for a little, for Merry still had several questions to ask.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Jumped over the Moon!' chuckled Merry as he rolled himself in his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">blanket. 'Very ridiculous of you, Frodo! But I wish I had been there to see.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The worthies of Bree will be discussing it a hundred years hence.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I hope so,' said Strider. Then they all fell silent, and one by one<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the hobbits dropped off to sleep.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As they prepared for sleep in the inn at Bree, darkness lay on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Buckland; a mist strayed in the dells and along the river -bank. The house at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Crickhollow stood silent. Fatty Bolger opened the door cautiously and peered<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">out. A feeling of fear had been growing on him all day, and he was unable to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">rest or go to bed: there was a brooding threat in the breathless night-air.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As he stared out into the gloom, a black shadow moved under the trees; the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">gate seemed to open of its own accord and close again without a sound.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Terror seized him. He shrank back, and for a moment he stood trembling in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the hall. Then he shut and locked the door.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The night deepened. There came the soft sound of horses led with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stealth along the lane. Outside the gate they stopped, and three black<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">figures entered, like shades of night creeping across the ground. One went<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to the door, one to the corner of the house on either side; and there they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stood, as still as the shadows of stones, while night went slowly on. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">house and the quiet trees seemed to be waiting breathlessly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There was a faint stir in the leaves, and a cock crowed far away. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">cold hour before dawn was passing. The figure by the door moved. In the dark<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">without moon or stars a drawn blade gleamed, as if a chill light had been<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">unsheathed. There was a blow, soft but heavy, and the door shuddered.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Open, in the name of Mordor!' said a voice thin and menacing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At a second blow the door yielded and fell back, with timbers burst and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">lock broken. The black figures passed swiftly in.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At that moment, among the trees nearby, a horn rang out. It rent the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">night like fire on a hill -top.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">AWAKE! FEAR! FIRE! FOES! AWAKE!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Fatty Bolger had not been idle. As soon as he saw the dark shapes creep<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">from the garden, he knew that he must run for it, or perish. And run he did,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">out of the back door, through the garden, and over the fields. When he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">reached the nearest house, more than a mile away, he collapsed on the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">doorstep. 'No, no, no!' he was crying. 'No, not me! I haven't got it!' It<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was some time before anyone could make out what he was babbling about.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">last they got the idea that enemies were in Buckland, some strange invasion<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">from the Old Forest. And then they lost no more time.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">FEAR! FIRE! FOES!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Brandybucks were blowing the Horn-call of Buckland, that had not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">been sounded for a hundred years, not since the white wolves came in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Fell Winter, when the Brandywine was frozen over.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">AWAKE! AWAKE!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Far-away answering horns were heard. The alarm was spreading. The black<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">figures fled from the house. One of them let fall a hobbit-cloak on the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">step, as he ran. In the lane the noise of hoofs broke out, and gathering to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a gallop, went hammering away into the darkness. All about Crickhollow there<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was the sound of horns blowing, and voices crying and feet running. But the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Black Riders rode like a gale to the North-gate. Let the little people blow!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sauron would deal with them later. Meanwhile they had another errand: they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">knew now that the house was empty and the Ring had gone. They rode down<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">guards at the gate and vanished from the Shire.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the early night Frodo woke from deep sleep, suddenly, as if some<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sound or presence had disturbed him. He saw that Strider was sitting alert<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in his chair: his eyes gleamed in the light of the fire, which had been<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">tended and was burning brightly; but he made no sign or movement.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo soon went to sleep again; but his dreams were again troubled with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the noise of wind and of galloping hoofs. The wind seemed to be curling<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">round the house and shaking it; and far off he heard a horn blowing wildly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He opened his eyes, and heard a cock crowing lustily in the inn-yard.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Strider had drawn the curtains and pushed back the shutters with a clang.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The first grey light of day was in the room, and a cold air was coming<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">through the open window.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As soon as Strider had roused them all, he led the way to their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">bedrooms. When they saw them they were glad that they had taken his advice:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the windows had been forced open and were swinging, and the curtains were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">flapping; the beds were tossed about, and the bolsters slashed and flung<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">upon the floor; the brown mat was torn to pieces.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Strider immediately went to fetch the landlord. Poor Mr. Butterbur<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">looked sleepy and frightened. He had hardly closed his eyes all night (so he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">said), but he had never heard a sound.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Never has such a thing happened in my time!' he cried, raising his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hands in horror. â€™Guests unable to sleep in their beds, and good bolsters<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ruined and all! What are we coming to?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Dark times,' said Strider. 'But for the present you may be left in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">peace, when you have got rid of us. We will leave at once. Never mind about<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">breakfast: a drink and a bite standing will have to do. We shall be packed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in a few minutes.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mr. Butterbur hurried off to see that their ponies were got ready, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to fetch them a 'bite'. But very soon he came back in dismay. The ponies had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">vanished! The stable-doors had all been opened in the night, and they were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">gone: not only Merry's ponies, but every other horse and beast in the place.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo was crushed by the news. How could they hope to reach Rivendell<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">on foot, pursued by mounted enemies? They might as well set out for the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Moon. Strider sat silent for a while, looking at the hobbits, as if he was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">weighing up their strength and courage.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Ponies would not help us to escape horsemen,' he said at last,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">thoughtfully, as if he guessed what Frodo had in mind. 'We should not go<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">much slower on foot, not on the roads that I mean to take. I was going to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">walk in any case. It is the food and stores that trouble me. We cannot count<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">on getting anything to eat between here and Rivendell, except what we take<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with us; and we ought to take plenty to spare; for we may be delayed, or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">forced to go round-about, far out of the direct way. How much are you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">prepared to carry on your backs?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'As much as we must,' said Pippin with a sinking heart, but trying to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">show that he was tougher than he looked (or felt).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I can carry enough for two,' said Sam defiantly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Can't anything be done, Mr. Butterbur?' asked Frodo. 'Can't we get a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">couple of ponies in the village, or even one just for the baggage? I don't<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">suppose we could hire them, but we might be able to buy them,' he added,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">doubtfully, wondering if he could afford it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I doubt it,' said the landlord unhappily. 'The two or three<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">riding-ponies that there were in Bree were stabled in my yard, and they're<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">gone. As for other animals, horses or ponies for draught or what not, there<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">are very few of them in Bree, and they won't be for sale. But I'll do what I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">can. I'll rout out Bob and send him round as soon as may be.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Yes,' said Strider reluctantly, 'you had better do that. I am afraid<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">we shall have to try to get one pony at least. But so ends all hope of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">starting early, and slipping away quietly! We might as well have blown a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">horn to announce our departure. That was part of their plan, no doubt.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'There is one crumb of comfort,' said Merry, 'and more than a crumb, I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hope: we can have breakfast while we wait - and sit down to it. Let's get<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hold of Nob!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the end there was more than three hours' delay. Bob came back with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the report that no horse or pony was to be got for love or money in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">neighbourhood - except one: Bill Ferny had one that he might possibly sell.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'A poor old half-starved creature it is,' said Bob; 'but he won't part with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it for less than thrice its worth, seeing how you're placed, not if I knows<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bill Ferny.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Bill Ferny?' said Frodo. 'Isn't there some trick? Wouldn't the beast<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">bolt back to him with all our stuff, or help in tracking us, or something?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I wonder,' said Strider. 'But I cannot imagine any animal running home<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to him, once it got away. I fancy this is only an afterthought of kind<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Master Ferny's: just a way of increasing his profits from the affair. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">chief danger is that the poor beast is probably at death's door. But there<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">does not seem any choice. What does he want for it?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bill Ferny's price was twelve silver pennies; and that was indeed at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">least three times the pony's value in those pans. It proved to be a bony,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">underfed, and dispirited animal; but it did not look like dying just yet.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mr. Butterbur paid for it himself, and offered Merry another eighteen pence<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">as some compensation for the lost animals. He was an honest man, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">well-off as things were reckoned in Bree; but thirty silver pennies was a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sore blow to him, and being cheated by Bill Ferny made it harder to bear.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Asa matter of fact he came out on the right side in the end. It turned<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">out later that only one horse had been actually stolen. The others had been<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">driven off, or had bolted in terror, and were found wandering in different<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">corners of the Bree-land. Merry's ponies had escaped altogether, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">eventually (having a good deal of sense) they made their way to the Downs in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">search of Fatty Lumpkin. So they came under the care of Tom Bombadil for a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">while, and were well-off. But when news of the events at Bree came to Tom's<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ears, he sent them to Mr. Butterbur, who thus got five good beasts at a very<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fair price. They had to work harder in Bree, but Bob treated them well; so<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">on the whole they were lucky: they missed a dark and dangerous journey. But<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they never came to Rivendell.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">However, in the meanwhile for all Mr. Butterbur knew his money was gone<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">for good, or for bad. And he had other troubles. For there was a great<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">commotion as soon as the remaining guests were astir and heard news of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">raid on the inn. The southern travellers had lost several horses and blamed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the innkeeper loudly, until it became known that one of their own number had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">also disappeared in the night, none other than Bill Ferny's squint-eyed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">companion. Suspicion fell on him at once.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'If you pick up with a horse-thief, and bring him to my house,' said<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Butterbur angrily, 'you ought to pay for all the damage yourselves and not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">come shouting at me. Go and ask Ferny where your handsome friend is!' But it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">appeared that he was nobody's friend, and nobody could recollect when he had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">joined their party.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After their breakfast the hobbits had to re-pack, and get together<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">further supplies for the longer journey they were now expecting. It was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">close on ten o'clock before they at last got off. By that time the whole of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bree was buzzing with excitement. Frodo's vanishing trick; the appearance of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the black horsemen; the robbing of the stables; and not least the news that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Strider the Ranger had joined the mysterious hobbits, made such a tale as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">would last for many uneventful years. Most of the inhabitants of Bree and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Staddle, and many even from Combe and Archet, were crowded in the road<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">see the travellers start. The other guests in the inn were at the doors or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hanging out of the windows.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Strider had changed his mind, and he decided to leave Bree by the main<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">road. Any attempt to set off across country at once would only make matters<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">worse: half the inhabitants would follow them, to see what they were up to,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and to prevent them from trespassing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They said farewell to Nob and Bob, and took leave of Mr. Butterbur with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">many thanks. 'I hope we shall meet again some day, when things are merry<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">once more,' said Frodo. 'I should like nothing better than to stay in your<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">house in peace for a while.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They tramped off, anxious and downhearted, under the eyes of the crowd.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Not all the faces were friendly, nor all the words that were shouted. But<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Strider seemed to be held in awe by most of the Bree-landers, and those that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he stared at shut their mouths and drew away. He walked in front with Frodo;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">next came Merry and Pippin; and last came Sam leading the pony, which was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">laden with as much of their baggage as they had the heart to give it; but<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">already it looked less dejected, as if it approved of the change in its<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fortunes. Sam was chewing an apple thoughtfully. He had a pocket full of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">them: a parting present from Nob and Bob. 'Apples for walking, and a pipe<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">for sitting,' he said. 'But I reckon I'll miss them both before long.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The hobbits took no notice of the inquisitive heads that peeped out of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">doors, or popped over walls and fences, as they passed. But as they drew<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">near to the further gate, Frodo saw a dark ill-kept house behind a thick<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hedge: the last house in the village. In one of the windows he caught a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">glimpse of a sallow face with sly, slanting eyes; but it vanished at once.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'So that's where that southerner is hiding!' he thought. 'He looks more<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">than half like a goblin.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Over the hedge another man was staring boldly. He had heavy black<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">brows, and dark scornful eyes; his large mouth curled in a sneer. He was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">smoking a short black pipe. As they approached he took it out of his mouth<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and spat.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Morning, Longshanks!' he said. 'Off early? Found some friends at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">last?' Strider nodded, but did not answer. 'Morning, my little friends!' he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">said to the others. 'I suppose you know who you've taken up with? That's<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Stick -at-naught Strider, that is! Though I've heard other names not so<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">pretty. Watch out tonight! And you, Sammie, don't go ill-treating my poor<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">old pony! Pah!' He spat again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sam turned quickly. 'And you. Ferny,' he said, 'put your ugly face out<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of sight, or it will get hurt.' With a sudden flick, quick as lightning, an<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">apple left his hand and hit Bill square on the nose. He ducked too late, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">curses came from behind the hedge. 'Waste of a good apple,' said Sam<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">regretfully, and strode on.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At last they left the village behind. The escort of children and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stragglers that had followed them got tired and turned back at the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">South-gate. Passing through, they kept on along the Road for some miles. It<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">bent to the left, curving back into its eastward line as it rounded the feet<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of Bree-hill, and then it began to run swiftly downwards into wooded<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">country. To their left they could see some of the houses and hobbit -holes of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Staddle on the gentler south-eastern slopes of the hill; down in a deep<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hollow away north of the Road there were wisps of rising smoke that showed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">where Combe lay;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Archet was hidden in the trees beyond.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After the Road had run down some way, and had left Bree-hill standing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">tall and brown behind, they came on a narrow track that led off towards the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">North. 'This is where we leave the open and take to cover,' said Strider.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Not a "short cut", I hope,' said Pippin. 'Our last short cut through<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">woods nearly ended in disaster.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Ah, but you had not got me with you then,' laughed Strider. 'My cuts,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">short or long, don't go wrong.' He took a look up and down the Road. No one<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was in sight; and he led the way quickly down towards the wooded valley.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">His plan, as far as they could understand it without knowing the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">country, was to go towards Archet at first, but to bear right and pass it on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the east, and then to steer as straight as he could over the wild lands to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Weathertop Hill. In that way they would, if all went well, cut off a great<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">loop of the Road, which further on bent southwards to avoid the Midgewater<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Marshes. But, of course, they would have to pass through the marshes<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">themselves, and Strider's description of them was not encouraging.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">However, in the meanwhile, walking was not unpleasant. Indeed, if it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">had not been for the disturbing events of the night before, they would have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">enjoyed this pan of the journey better than any up to that time. The sun was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shining, clear but not too hot. The woods in the valley were still leafy and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">full of colour, and seemed peaceful and wholesome. Strider guided them<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">confidently among the many crossing paths, although left to themselves they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">would soon have been at a loss. He was taking a wandering course with many<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">turns and doublings, to put off any pursuit.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Bill Ferny will have watched where we left the Road, for certain,' he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">said; 'though I don't think he will follow us himself. He knows the land<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">round here well enough, but he knows he is not a match for me in a wood. It<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">is what he may tell others that I am afraid of. I don't suppose they are far<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">away. If they think we have made for Archet, so much the better.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Whether because of Strider's skill or for some other reason, they saw<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">no sign and heard no sound of any other living thing all that day: neither<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">two-footed, except birds; nor four-footed, except one fox and a few<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">squirrels. The next day they began to steer a steady course eastwards; and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">still all was quiet and peaceful. On the third day out from Bree they came<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">out of the Chetwood. The land had been falling steadily, ever since they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">turned aside from the Road, and they now entered a wide flat expanse of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">country, much more difficult to manage. They were far beyond the borders of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Bree-land, out in the pathless wilderness, and drawing near to the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Midge- water Marshes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The ground now became damp, and in places boggy and here and there they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">came upon pools, and wide stretches of reeds and rushes filled with the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">warbling of little hidden birds. They had to pick their way carefully to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">keep both dry-footed and on their proper course. At first they made<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fan-progress, but as they went on, their passage became slower and more<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dangerous. The marshes were bewildering and treacherous, and there was no<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">permanent trail even for Rangers to find through their shifting quagmires.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The flies began to torment them, and the air was full of clouds of tiny<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">midges that crept up their sleeves and breeches and into their hair.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I am being eaten alive!' cried Pippin. 'Midgewater! There are more<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">midges than water!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'What do they live on when they can't get hobbit?' asked Sam,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">scratching his neck.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They spent a miserable day in this lonely and unpleasant country. Their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">camping-place was damp, cold, and uncomfortable; and the biting insects<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">would not let them sleep. There were also abominable creatures haunting the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">reeds and tussocks that from the sound of them were evil relatives of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">cricket. There were thousands of them, and they squeaked all round,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">neek-breek, breek-neek, unceasingly all the night, until the hobbits were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">nearly frantic.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The next day, the fourth, was little better, and the night almost as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">comfortless. Though the Neekerbreekers (as Sam called them) had been left<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">behind, the midges still pursued them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As Frodo lay, tired but unable to close his eyes, it seemed to him that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">far away there came a light in the eastern sky: it flashed and faded many<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">times. It was not the dawn, for that was still some hours off.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'What is the light?' he said to Strider, who had risen, and was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">standing, gazing ahead into the night.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I do not know,' Strider answered. 'It is too distant to make out. It<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">is like lightning that leaps up from the hill-tops.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo lay down again, but for a long while he could still see the white<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">flashes, and against them the tall dark figure of Strider, standing silent<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and watchful. At last he passed into uneasy sleep.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They had not gone far on the fifth day when they left the last<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">straggling pools and reed-beds of the marshes behind them. The land before<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">them began steadily to rise again. Away in the distance eastward they could<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">now see a line of hills. The highest of them was at the right of the line<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and a little separated from the others. It had a conical top, slightly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">flattened at the summit.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'That is Weathertop,' said Strider. 'The Old Road, which we have left<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">far away on our right, runs to the south of it and passes not far from its<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">foot. We might reach it by noon tomorrow, if we go straight towards it. I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">suppose we had better do so.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™What do you mean?' asked Frodo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I mean: when we do get there, it is not certain what we shall find. It<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">is close to the Road.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'But surely we were hoping to find Gandalf there?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Yes; but the hope is faint. If he comes this way at all, he may not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">pass through Bree, and so he may not know what we are doing. And anyway,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">unless by luck we arrive almost together, we shall miss one another; it will<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">not be safe for him or for us to wait there long. If the Riders fail to find<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">us in the wilderness, they are likely to make for Weathertop themselves. It<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">commands a wide view all round. Indeed, there are many birds and beasts in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">this country that could see us, as we stand here, from that hill-top. Not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">all the birds are to be trusted, and there are other spies more evil than<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they are.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The hobbits looked anxiously at the distant hills. Sam looked up into<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the pale sky, fearing to see hawks or eagles hovering over them with bright<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">unfriendly eyes. 'You do make me feel uncomfortable and lonesome, Strider!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he said.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'What do you advise us to do?' asked Frodo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I think,' answered Strider slowly, as if he was not quite sure, 'I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">think the best thing is to go as straight eastward from here as we can, to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">make for the line of hills, not for Weathertop. There we can strike a path I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">know that runs at their feet; it will bring us to Weathertop from the north<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and less openly. Then we shall see what we shall see.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">All that day they plodded along, until the cold and early evening came<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">down. The land became drier and more barren; but mists and vapours lay<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">behind them on the marshes. A few melancholy birds were piping and wailing,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">until the round red sun sank slowly into the western shadows; then an empty<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">silence fell. The hobbits thought of the soft light of sunset glancing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">through the cheerful windows of Bag End far away.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At the day's end they came to a stream that wandered down from the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hills to lose itself in the stagnant marshland, and they went up along its<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">banks while the light lasted. It was already night when at last they halted<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and made their camp under some stunted alder -trees by the shores of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stream. Ahead there loomed now against the dusky sky the bleak and treeless<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">backs of the hills. That night they set a watch, and Strider, it seemed, did<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">not sleep at all. The moon was waxing, and in the early night -hours a cold<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">grey light lay on the land.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Next morning they set out again soon after sunrise. There was a frost<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in the air, and the sky was a pale clear blue. The hobbits felt refreshed,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">as if they had had a night of unbroken sleep. Already they were getting used<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to much walking on short commons - shorter at any rate than what in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Shire they would have thought barely enough to keep them on their legs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Pippin declared that Frodo was looking twice the hobbit that he had been.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Very odd,' said Frodo, tightening his belt, 'considering that there is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">actually a good deal less of me. I hope the thinning process will not go on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">indefinitely, or I shall become a wraith.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Do not speak of such things!' said Strider quickly, and with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">surprising earnestness.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The hills drew nearer. They made an undulating ridge, often rising<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">almost to a thousand feet, and here and there falling again to low clefts or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">passes leading into the eastern land beyond. Along the crest of the ridge<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the hobbits could see what looked to be the remains of green-grown walls and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dikes, and in the clefts there still stood the ruins of old works of stone.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">By night they had reached the feet of the westward slopes, and there they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">camped. It was the night of the fifth of October, and they were six days out<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">from Bree.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the morning they found, for the first time since they had left the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Chetwood, a track plain to see. They turned right and followed it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">southwards. It ran cunningly, taking a line that seemed chosen so as to keep<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">as much hidden as possible from the view, both of the hill-tops above and of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the flats to the west. It dived into dells, and hugged steep banks; and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">where it passed over flatter and more open ground on either side of it there<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were lines of large boulders and hewn stones that screened the travellers<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">almost like a hedge.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I wonder who made this path, and what for,' said Merry, as they walked<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">along one of these avenues, where the stones were unusually large and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">closely set. 'I am not sure that I like it: it has a - well, rather a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">barrow- wightish look. Is there any barrow on Weathertop?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'No. There is no barrow on Weathertop, nor on any of these hills,'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">answered Strider. 'The Men of the West did not live here; though in their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">latter days they defended the hills for a while against the evil that came<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">out of Angmar. This path was made to serve the forts along the walls. But<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">long before, in the first days of the North Kingdom, they built a great<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">watch-tower on Weathertop, Amon Syl they called it. It was burned and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">broken, and nothing remains of it now but a tumbled ring, like a rough crown<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">on the old hill's head. Yet once it was tall and fair. It is told that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Elendil stood there watching for the coming of Gil-galad out of the West, in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the days of the Last Alliance.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The hobbits gazed at Strider. It seemed that he was learned in old<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">lore, as well as in the ways of the wild. 'Who was Gil-galad?' asked Merry;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">but Strider did not answer, and seemed to be lost in thought. Suddenly a low<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">voice murmured:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gil-galad was an Elven-king.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Of him the harpers sadly sing:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the last whose realm was fair and free<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">between the Mountains and the Sea.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">His sword was long, his lance was keen,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his shining helm afar was seen;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the countless stars of heaven's field<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were mirrored in his silver shield.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But long ago he rode away,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and where he dwelleth none can say;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">for into darkness fell his star<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in Mordor where the shadows are.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The others turned in amazement, for the voice was Sam's.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Don't stop!' said Merry.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'That's all I know,' stammered Sam, blushing. 'I learned it from Mr.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bilbo when I was a lad. He used to tell me tales like that, knowing how I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was always one for hearing about Elves. It was Mr. Bilbo as taught me my<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">letters. He was mighty book -learned was dear old Mr. Bilbo. And he wrote<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">poetry. He wrote what I have just said.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'He did not make it up,' said Strider. 'It is pan of the lay that is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">called The Fall of Gil-galad, which is in an ancient tongue. Bilbo must have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">translated it. I never knew that.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'There was a lot more,' said Sam, 'all about Mordor. I didn't learn<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that part, it gave me the shivers I never thought I should be going that way<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">myself!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™Going to Mordor!' cried Pippin. 'I hope it won't come to that!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Do not speak that name so loudly!' said Strider.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It was already mid-day when they drew near the southern end of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">path, and saw before them, in the pale clear light of the October sun, a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">grey-green bank, leading up like a bridge on to the northward slope of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hill They decided to make for the top at once, while the daylight was broad<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Concealment was no longer possible, and they could only hope that no enemy<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">or spy was observing them. Nothing was to be seen moving on the hill. If<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gandalf was anywhere about, there was no sign of him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">On the western flank of Weathertop they found a sheltered hollow, at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the bottom of which there was a bowl -shaped dell with grassy sides. There<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they left Sam and Pippin with the pony and their packs and luggage. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">other three went on. After half an hour's plodding climb Strider reached the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">crown of the hill; Frodo and Merry followed, tired and breathless. The last<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">slope had been steep and rocky.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">On the top they found, as Strider had said, a wide ring of ancient<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stonework, now crumbling or covered with age-long grass. But in the centre a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">cairn of broken stones had been piled. They were blackened as if with fire.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">About them the turf was burned to the roots and all within the ring the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">grass was scorched and shrivelled, as if flames had swept the hill-top; but<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">there was no sign of any living thing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Standing upon the rim of the ruined circle, they saw all round below<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">them a wide prospect, for the most pan of lands empty and featureless,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">except for patches of woodland away to the south, beyond which they caught<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">here and there the glint of distant water. Beneath them on this southern<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">side there ran like a ribbon the Old Road, coming out of the West and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">winding up and down, until it faded behind a ridge of dark land to the east.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Nothing was moving on it. Following its line eastward with their eyes they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">saw the Mountains: the nearer foothills were brown and sombre;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">behind them stood taller shapes of grey, and behind those again were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">high white peaks glimmering among the clouds.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well, here we are!' said Merry. 'And very cheerless and uninviting it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">looks! There is no water and no shelter. And no sign of Gandalf. But I don't<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">blame him for not waiting - if he ever came here.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I wonder,' said Strider, looking round thoughtfully. 'Even if he was a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">day or two behind us at Bree, he could have arrived here first. He can ride<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">very swiftly when need presses.â€™ Suddenly he stooped and looked at the stone<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">on the top of the cairn; it was flatter than the others, and whiter, as if<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it had escaped the fire. He picked it up and examined it, turning it in his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fingers. "This has been handled recently,' he said. 'What do you think of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">these marks?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">On the flat under-side Frodo saw some scratches: 'There seems to he a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stroke, a dot, and three more strokes,' he said.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'The stroke on the left might be a G-rune with thin branches,' said<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Strider. 'It might be a sign left by Gandalf, though one cannot be sure. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">scratches are fine, and they certainly look fresh. But the marks might mean<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">something quite different, and have nothing to do with us. Rangers use<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">runes, and they come here sometimes.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'What could they mean, even if Gandalf made them?' asked Merry<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I should say,' answered Strider, 'that they stood for G3, and were a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sign that Gandalf was here on October the third: that is three days ago now.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It would also show that he was in a hurry and danger was at hand, so that he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">had no time or did not dare to write anything longer or plainer. If that is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">so, we must be wary.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I wish we could feel sure that he made the marks, whatever they may<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mean,' said Frodo 'It would be a great comfort to know that he was on the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">way, in front of us or behind us.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Perhaps,' said Strider. 'For myself, I believe that he was here, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was in danger. There have been scorching flames here; and now the light that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">we saw three nights ago in the eastern sky comes back to my mind. I guess<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that he was attacked on this hill-top, but with what result I cannot tell.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He is here no longer, and we must now look after ourselves and make our own<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">way to Rivendell, as best we can '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'How far is Rivendell?' asked Merry, gazing round wearily. The world<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">looked wild and wide from Weathertop.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I don't know if the Road has ever been measured in miles beyond the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Forsaken Inn, a day's journey east of Bree,' answered Strider. 'Some say it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">is so far, and some say otherwise. It is a strange road, and folk are glad<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to reach their journey's end, whether the time is long or short. But I know<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">how long it would take me on my own feet, with fair weather and no ill<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fortune twelve days from here to the Ford of Bruinen, where the Road crosses<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Loudwater that runs out of Rivendell. We have at least a fortnight's<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">journey before us, for I do not think we shall be able to use the Road.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'A fortnight!' said Frodo. 'A lot may happen in that time.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'It may,' said Strider.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They stood for a while silent on the hill -top, near its southward edge.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In that lonely place Frodo for the first time fully realized his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">homelessness and danger. He wished bitterly that his fortune had left him in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the quiet and beloved Shire. He stared down at the hateful Road, leading<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">back westward - to his home. Suddenly he was aware that two black specks<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were moving slowly along it, going westward; and looking again he saw that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">three others were creeping eastward to meet them. He gave a cry and clutched<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Strider's arm.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Look,' he said, pointing downwards.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At once Strider flung himself on the ground behind the ruined circle,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">pulling Frodo down beside him. Merry threw himself alongside.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'What is it?' he whispered.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I do not know, but I fear the worst,' answered Strider.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Slowly they crawled up to the edge of the ring again, and peered<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">through a cleft between two jagged stones. The light was no longer bright,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">for the clear morning had faded, and clouds creeping out of the East had now<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">overtaken the sun, as it began to go down. They could all see the black<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">specks, but neither Frodo nor Merry could make out their shapes for certain;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">yet something told them that there, far below, were Black Riders assembling<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">on the Road beyond the foot of the hill.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Yes,' said Strider, whose keener sight left him in no doubt. 'The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">enemy is here!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Hastily they crept away and slipped down the north side of the hill to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">find their companions.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sam and Peregrin had not been idle. They had explored the small dell<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and the surrounding slopes. Not far away they found a spring of clear water<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in the hillside, and near it footprints not more than a day or two old. In<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the dell itself they found recent traces of a fire, and other signs of a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hasty camp. There were some fallen rocks on the edge of the dell nearest to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the hill. Behind them Sam came upon a small store of firewood neatly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stacked.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I wonder if old Gandalf has been here,' he said to Pippin. 'Whoever it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was put this stuff here meant to come back it seems.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Strider was greatly interested in these discoveries. 'I wish I had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">waited and explored the ground down here myself,' he said, hurrying off to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the spring to examine the footprints.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'It is just as I feared,' he said, when he came back. 'Sam and Pippin<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">have trampled the soft ground, and the marks are spoilt or confused. Rangers<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">have been here lately. It is they who left the firewood behind. But there<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">are also several newer tracks that were not made by Rangers. At least one<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">set was made, only a day or two ago, by heavy boots. At least one. I cannot<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">now be certain, but I think there were many booted feet.' He paused and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stood in anxious thought.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Each of the hobbits saw in his mind a vision of the cloaked and booted<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Riders. If the horsemen had already found the dell, the sooner Strider led<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">them somewhere else the better. Sam viewed the hollow with great dislike,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">now that he had heard news of their enemies on the Road, only a few miles<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">away.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Hadn't we better clear out quick, Mr. Strider?' he asked impatiently.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'It is getting late, and I don't like this hole: it makes my heart sink<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">somehow.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Yes, we certainly must decide what to do at once,' answered Strider,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">looking up and considering the time and the weather. 'Well, Sam,' he said at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">last, 'I do not like this place either; but I cannot think of anywhere<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">better that we could reach before nightfall. At least we are out of sight<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">for the moment, and if we moved we should be much more likely to be seen<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">spies. All we could do would be to go right out of our way back north on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">this side of the line of hills, where the land is all much the same as it is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">here. The Road is watched, but we should have to cross it, if we tried to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">take cover in the thickets away to the south. On the north side of the Road<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">beyond the hills the country is bare and flat for miles.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Can the Riders see ?' asked Merry. 'I mean, they seem usually to have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">used their noses rather than their eyes, smelling for us, if smelling is the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">right word, at least in the daylight. But you made us lie down flat when you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">saw them down below; and now you talk of being seen, if we move.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I was too careless on the hill-top,' answered Strider. 'I was very<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">anxious to find some sign of Gandalf; but it was a mistake for three of us<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to go up and stand there so long. For the black horses can see, and the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Riders can use men and other creatures as spies, as we found at Bree. They<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">themselves do not see the world of light as we do, but our shapes cast<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shadows in their minds, which only the noon sun destroys; and in the dark<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they perceive many signs and forms that are hidden from us: then they are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">most to be feared. And at all times they smell the blood of living things,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">desiring and hating it. Senses, too, there are other than sight or smell. We<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">can feel their presence - it troubled our hearts, as soon as we came here,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and before we saw them; they feel ours more keenly. Also,' he added, and his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">voice sank to a whisper, 'the Ring draws them.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Is there no escape then?' said Frodo, looking round wildly. 'If I move<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I shall be seen and hunted! If I stay, I shall draw them to me!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Strider laid his hand on his shoulder. 'There is still hope,' he said.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You are not alone. Let us take this wood that is set ready for the fire as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a sign. There is little shelter or defence here, but fire shall serve for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">both. Sauron can put fire to his evil uses, as he can all things, but these<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Riders do not love it, and fear those who wield it. Fire is our friend in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the wilderness.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Maybe,' muttered Sam. 'It is also as good a way of saying "here we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">are" as I can think of, bar shouting.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Down in the lowest and most sheltered corner of the dell they lit a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fire, and prepared a meal. The shades of evening began to fall, and it grew<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">cold. They were suddenly aware of great hunger, for they had not eaten<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">anything since breakfast; but they dared not make more than a frugal supper.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The lands ahead were empty of all save birds and beasts, unfriendly places<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">deserted by all the races of the world. Rangers passed at times beyond the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hills, but they were few and did not stay. Other wanderers were rare, and of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">evil sort: trolls might stray down at times out of the northern valleys of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Misty Mountains. Only on the Road would travellers be found, most often<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dwarves, hurrying along on business of their own, and with no help and few<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">words to spare for strangers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I don't see how our food can be made to last,' said Frodo. 'We have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">been careful enough in the last few days, and this supper is no feast; but<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">we have used more than we ought, if we have two weeks still to go, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">perhaps more.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'There is food in the wild,' said Strider; 'berry, root, and herb; and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I have some skill as a hunter at need. You need not be afraid of starving<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">before winter comes. But gathering and catching food is long and weary work,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and we need haste. So tighten your belts, and think with hope of the tables<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of Elrond's house!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The cold increased as darkness came on. Peering out from the edge of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the dell they could see nothing but a grey land now vanishing quickly into<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shadow. The sky above had cleared again and was slowly filled with twinkling<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stars. Frodo and his companions huddled round the fire, wrapped in every<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">garment and blanket they possessed; but Strider was content with a single<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">cloak, and sat a little apart, drawing thoughtfully at his pipe.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As night fell and the light of the fire began to shine out brightly he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">began to tell them tales to keep their minds from fear. He knew many<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">histories and legends of long ago, of Elves and Men and the good and evil<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">deeds of the Elder Days. They wondered how old he was, and where he had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">learned all this lore.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Tell us of Gil-galad,â€™ said Merry suddenly, when he paused at the end<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of a story of the Elf-Kingdoms. 'Do you know any more of that old lay that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you spoke of?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I do indeed,' answered Strider. 'So also does Frodo, for it concerns<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">us closely.' Merry and Pippin looked at Frodo, who was staring into the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fire.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I know only the little that Gandalf has told me,' said Frodo slowly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Gil-galad was the last of the great Elf-kings of Middle-earth. Gil-galad is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Starlight in their tongue. With Elendil, the Elf-friend, he went to the land<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'No!' said Strider interrupting, 'I do not think that tale should be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">told now with the servants of the Enemy at hand. If we win through to the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">house of Elrond, you may hear it there, told in full.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Then tell us some other tale of the old days,' begged Sam; 'a tale<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">about the Elves before the fading time. I would dearly like to hear more<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">about Elves; the dark seems to press round so close.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I will tell you the tale of TinÂ®viel,' said Strider, 'in brief - for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it is a long tale of which the end is not known; and there are none now,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">except Elrond, that remember it aright as it was told of old. It is a fair<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">tale, though it is sad, as are all the tales of Middle-earth, and yet it may<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">lift up your hearts.' He was silent for some time, and then he began not to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">speak but to chant softly:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The leaves were long, the grass was green,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The hemlock-umbels tall and fair,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And in the glade a light was seen<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Of stars in shadow shimmering.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">TinÂ®viel was dancing there<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">To music of a pipe unseen,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And light of stars was in her hair,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And in her raiment glimmering.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There Beren came from mountains cold,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And lost he wandered under leaves,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And where the Elven-river rolled<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He walked alone and sorrowing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He peered between the hemlock-leaves<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And saw in wander flowers of gold<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Upon her mantle and her sleeves,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And her hair like shadow following.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Enchantment healed his weary feet<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">That over hills were doomed to roam;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And forth he hastened, strong and fleet,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And grasped at moonbeams glistening.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Through woven woods in Elvenhome<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">She tightly fled on dancing feet,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And left him lonely still to roam<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the silent forest listening.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He heard there oft the flying sound<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Of feet as light as linden-leaves,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Or music welling underground,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In hidden hollows quavering.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Now withered lay the hemlock-sheaves,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And one by one with sighing sound<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Whispering fell the beechen leaves<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the wintry woodland wavering.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He sought her ever, wandering far<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Where leaves of years were thickly strewn,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">By light of moon and ray of star<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In frosty heavens shivering.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Her mantle glinted in the moon,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As on a hill-top high and far<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">She danced, and at her feet was strewn<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A mist of silver quivering.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">When winter passed, she came again,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And her song released the sudden spring,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Like rising lark, and falling rain,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And melting water bubbling.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He saw the elven-flowers spring<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">About her feet, and healed again<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He longed by her to dance and sing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Upon the grass untroubling.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Again she fled, but swift he came.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">TinÂ®viel! TinÂ®viel!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He called her by her elvish name;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And there she halted listening.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">One moment stood she, and a spell<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">His voice laid on her: Beren came,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And doom fell on TinÂ®viel<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">That in his arms lay glistening.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As Beren looked into her eyes<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Within the shadows of her hair,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The trembling starlight of the skies<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He saw there mirrored shimmering.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">TinÂ®viel the elven-fair,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Immortal maiden elven-wise,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">About him cast her shadowy hair<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And arms like silver glimmering.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Long was the way that fate them bore,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">O'er stony mountains cold and grey,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Through halls of iron and darkling door,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And woods of nightshade morrowless.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Sundering Seas between them lay,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And yet at last they met once more,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And long ago they passed away<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the forest singing sorrowless.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Strider sighed and paused before he spoke again. â€™That is a song,' he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">said, 'in the mode that is called ann-thennath among the Elves, but is hard<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to render in our Common Speech, and this is but a rough echo of it. It tells<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of the meeting of Beren son of Barahir and LÂ®thien TinÂ®viel. Beren was a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mortal man, but LÂ®thien was the daughter of Thingol, a King of Elves upon<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Middle-earth when the world was young; and she was the fairest maiden that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">has ever been among all the children of this world. As the stars above the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mists of the Northern lands was her loveliness, and in her face was a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shining light. In those days the Great Enemy, of whom Sauron of Mordor was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">but a servant, dwelt in Angband in the North, and the Elves of the West<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">coming back to Middle-earth made war upon him to regain the Silmarils which<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he had stolen; and the fathers of Men aided the Elves. But the Enemy was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">victorious and Barahir was slain, and Beren escaping through great peril<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">came over the Mountains of Terror into the hidden Kingdom of Thingol in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">forest of Neldoreth. There he beheld LÂ®thien singing and dancing in a glade<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">beside the enchanted river Esgalduin; and he named her TinÂ®viel, that is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Nightingale in the language of old. Many sorrows befell them afterwards, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they were parted long. TinÂ®viel rescued Beren from the dungeons of Sauron,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and together they passed through great dangers, and cast down even the Great<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Enemy from his throne, and took from his iron crown one of the three<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Silmarils, brightest of all jewels, to be the bride-price of LÂ®thien to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Thingol her father. Yet at the last Beren was slain by the Wolf that came<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">from the gates of Angband, and he died in the arms of TinÂ®viel. But she<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">chose mortality, and to die from the world, so that she might follow him;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and it is sung that they met again beyond the Sundering Seas, and after a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">brief time walking alive once more in the green woods, together they passed,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">long ago, beyond the confines of this world. So it is that LÂ®thien TinÂ®viel<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">alone of the Elf-kindred has died indeed and left the world, and they have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">lost her whom they most loved. But from her the lineage of the Elf-lords of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">old descended among Men. There live still those of whom LÂ®thien was the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">foremother, and it is said that her line shall never fail. Elrond of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Rivendell is of that Kin. For of Beren and LÂ®thien was born Dior Thingolâ€™s<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">heir; and of him Elwing the White whom Edrendil wedded, he that sailed his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ship out of the mists of the world into the seas of heaven with the Silmaril<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">upon his brow. And of Edrendil came the Kings of NÂ®menor, that is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Westernesse.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As Strider was speaking they watched his strange eager face, dimly lit<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in the red glow of the wood-fire. His eyes shone, and his voice was rich and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">deep. Above him was a black starry sky. Suddenly a pale light appeared over<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the crown of Weathertop behind him. The waxing moon was climbing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">slowly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">above the hill that overshadowed them, and the stars above the hill-top<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">faded.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The story ended. The hobbits moved and stretched. 'Look!' said Merry.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'The Moon is rising: it must be getting late.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The others looked up. Even as they did so, they saw on the top of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hill something small and dark against the glimmer of the moonrise. It was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">perhaps only a large stone or jutting rock shown up by the pale light.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sam and Merry got up and walked away from the fire. Frodo and Pippin<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">remained seated in silence. Strider was watching the moonlight on the hill<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">intently. All seemed quiet and still, but Frodo felt a cold dread creeping<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">over his heart, now that Strider was no longer speaking. He huddled closer<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to the fire. At that moment Sam came running back from the edge of the dell.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I don't know what it is,' he said, 'but I suddenly felt afraid. I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">durstn't go outside this dell for any money; I felt that something was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">creeping up the slope.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Did you see anything?' asked Frodo, springing to his feet.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'No, sir. I saw nothing, but I didn't stop to look.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I saw something,' said Merry; 'or I thought I did - away westwards<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">where the moonlight was falling on the flats beyond the shadow of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hill-tops, I thought there were two or three black shapes. They seemed to be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">moving this way.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Keep close to the fire, with your faces outward!' cried Strider. 'Get<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">some of the longer sticks ready in your hands!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For a breathless time they sat there, silent and alert, with their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">backs turned to the wood-fire, each gazing into the shadows that encircled<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">them. Nothing happened. There was no sound or movement in the night.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stirred, feeling that he must break the silence: he longed to shout out<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">aloud.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Hush!' whispered Strider. 'What's that?' gasped Pippin at the same<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">moment.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Over the lip of the little dell, on the side away from the hill, they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">felt, rather than saw, a shadow rise, one shadow or more than one. They<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">strained their eyes, and the shadows seemed to grow. Soon there could be no<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">doubt:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">three or four tall black figures were standing there on the slope,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">looking down on them. So black were they that they seemed like black holes<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in the deep shade behind them. Frodo thought that he heard a faint hiss as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of venomous breath and felt a thin piercing chill. Then the shapes slowly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">advanced.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Terror overcame Pippin and Merry, and they threw themselves flat on the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ground. Sam shrank to Frodo's side. Frodo was hardly less terrified than his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">companions; he was quaking as if he was bitter cold, but his terror was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">swallowed up in a sudden temptation to put on the Ring. The desire to do<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">this laid hold of him, and he could think of nothing else. Fie did not forget<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Barrow, nor the message of Gandalf; but something seemed to be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">compelling him to disregard all warnings, and he longed to yield. Not with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the hope of escape, or of doing anything, either good or bad: he simply felt<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that he must take the Ring and put it on his finger. Fie could not speak. Fie<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">felt Sam looking at him, as if he knew that his master was in some great<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">trouble, but he could not turn towards him. He shut his eyes and struggled<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">for a while; but resistance became unbearable, and at last he slowly drew<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">out the chain, and slipped the Ring on the forefinger of his left hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Immediately, though everything else remained as before, dim and dark,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the shapes became terribly clear. He was able to see beneath their black<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wrappings. There were five tall figures: two standing on the lip of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dell, three advancing. In their white faces burned keen and merciless eyes;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">under their mantles were long grey robes; upon their grey hairs were helms<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of silver; in their haggard hands were swords of steel. Their eyes fell on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">him and pierced him, as they rushed towards him. Desperate, he drew his own<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sword, and it seemed to him that it flickered red, as if it was a firebrand.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Two of the figures halted. The third was taller than the others: his hair<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was long and gleaming and on his helm was a crown. In one hand he held a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">long sword, and in the other a knife; both the knife and the hand that held<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it glowed with a pale light. He sprang forward and bore down on Frodo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At that moment Frodo threw himself forward on the ground, and he heard<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">himself crying aloud: O Elbereth! Gilthoniel! At the same time he struck at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the feet of his enemy. A shrill cry rang out in the night; and he felt a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">pain like a dart of poisoned ice pierce his left shoulder. Even as he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">swooned he caught, as through a swirling mist, a glimpse of Strider leaping<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">out of the darkness with a flaming brand of wood in either hand. With a last<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">effort Frodo, dropping his sword, slipped the Ring from his finger and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">closed his right hand tight upon it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">When Frodo came to himself he was still clutching the Ring desperately.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He was lying by the fire, which was now piled high and burning brightly. His<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">three companions were bending over him. 'What has happened? Where is the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">pale king?' he asked wildly. They were too overjoyed to hear him speak to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">answer for a while; nor did they understand his question. At length he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">gathered from Sam that they had seen nothing but the vague shadowy shapes<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">coming towards them. Suddenly to his horror Sam found that his master had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">vanished; and at that moment a black shadow rushed past him, and he fell. He<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">heard Frodoâ€™s voice, but it seemed to come from a great distance, or from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">under the earth, crying out strange words. They saw nothing more, until they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stumbled over the body of Frodo, lying as if dead, face downwards on the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">grass with his sword beneath him. Strider ordered them to pick him up and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">lay him near the fire, and then he disappeared. That was now a good while<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ago.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sam plainly was beginning to have doubts again about Strider; but while<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they were talking he returned, appearing suddenly out of the shadows. They<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">started, and Sam drew his sword and stood over Frodo; but Strider knelt down<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">swiftly at his side.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I am not a Black Rider, Sam,' he said gently, 'nor in league with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">them. I have been trying to discover something of their movements; but I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">have found nothing. I cannot think why they have gone and do not attack<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">again. But there is no feeling of their presence anywhere at hand.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">When he heard what Frodo had to tell, he became full of concern, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shook his head and sighed. Then he ordered Pippin and Merry to heat as much<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">water as they could in their small kettles, and to bathe the wound with it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Keep the fire going well, and keep Frodo warm!' he said. Then he got up and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">walked away, and called Sam to him. 'I think I understand things better<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">now,' he said in a low voice. 'There seem only to have been five of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">enemy. Why they were not all here, I don't know; but I don't think they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">expected to be resisted. They have drawn off for the time being. But not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">far, I fear. They will come again another night, if we cannot escape. They<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">are only waiting, because they think that their purpose is almost<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">accomplished, and that the Ring cannot fly much further. I fear, Sam, that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they believe your master has a deadly wound that will subdue him to their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">will. We shall see!' Sam choked with tears. 'Don't despair!' said Strider.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You must trust me now. Your Frodo is made of sterner stuff than I had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">guessed, though Gandalf hinted that it might prove so. He is not slain, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I think he will resist the evil power of the wound longer than his enemies<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">expect. I will do all I can to help and heal him. Guard him well, while I am<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">away!' He hurried off and disappeared again into the darkness.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo dozed, though the pain of his wound was slowly growing, and a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">deadly chill was spreading from his shoulder to his arm and side. His<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">friends watched over him, warming him, and bathing his wound. The night<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">passed slowly and wearily. Dawn was growing in the sky, and the dell was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">filling with grey light, when Strider at last returned.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Look!' he cried; and stooping he lifted from the ground a black cloak<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that had lain there hidden by the darkness. A foot above the lower hem there<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was a slash. 'This was the stroke of Frodo's sword,' he said. 'The only hurt<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that it did to his enemy, I fear; for it is unharmed, but all blades perish<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that pierce that dreadful King. More deadly to him was the name of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Elbereth.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'And more deadly to Frodo was this!' He stooped again and lifted up a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">long thin knife. There was a cold gleam in it. As Strider raised it they saw<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that near the end its edge was notched and the point was broken off. But<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">even as he held it up in the growing light, they gazed in astonishment, for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the blade seemed to melt, and vanished like a smoke in the air, leaving only<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the hilt in Strider's hand. 'Alas!' he cried. 'It was this accursed knife<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that gave the wound. Few now have the skill in healing to match such evil<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">weapons. But I will do what I can.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He sat down on the ground, and taking the dagger -hilt laid it on his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">knees, and he sang over it a slow song in a strange tongue. Then setting it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">aside, he turned to Frodo and in a soft tone spoke words the others could<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">not catch. From the pouch at his belt he drew out the long leaves of a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">plant.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'These leaves,' he said, 'I have walked far to find; for this plant<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">does not grow in the bare hills; but in the thickets away south of the Road<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I found it in the dark by the scent of its leaves.' He crushed a leaf in his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fingers, and it gave out a sweet and pungent fragrance. 'It is fortunate<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that I could find it, for it is a healing plant that the Men of the West<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">brought to Middle-earth. Athelas they named it, and it grows now sparsely<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and only near places where they dwelt or camped of old; and it is not known<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in the North, except to some of those who wander in the Wild. It has great<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">virtues, but over such a wound as this its healing powers may be small.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He threw the leaves into boiling water and bathed Frodo's shoulder. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fragrance of the steam was refreshing, and those that were unhurt felt their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">minds calmed and cleared. The herb had also some power over the wound, for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo felt the pain and also the sense of frozen cold lessen in his side;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">but the life did not return to his arm, and he could not raise or use his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hand. He bitterly regretted his foolishness, and reproached himself for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">weakness of will; for he now perceived that in putting on the Ring he obeyed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">not his own desire but the commanding wish of his enemies. He wondered if he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">would remain maimed for life, and how they would now manage to continue<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">their journey. He fell too weak to stand.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The others were discussing this very question. They quickly decided to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">leave Weathertop as soon as possible. 'I think now,' said Strider, 'that the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">enemy has been watching this place for some days. If Gandalf ever came here,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">then he must have been forced to ride away, and he will not return. In any<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">case we are in great peril here after dark, since the attack of last night,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and we can hardly meet greater danger wherever we go.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As soon as the daylight was full, they had some hurried food and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">packed. It was impossible for Frodo to walk, so they divided the greater<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">part of their baggage among the four of them, and put Frodo on the pony. In<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the last few days the poor beast had improved wonderfully; it already seemed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fatter and stronger, and had begun to show an affection for its new masters,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">especially for Sam. Bill Ferny's treatment must have been very hard for the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">journey in the wild to seem so much better than its former life.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They started off in a southerly direction. This would mean crossing the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Road, but. it was the quickest way to more wooded country. And they needed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fuel; for Strider said that Frodo must be kept warm, especially at night,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">while fire would be some protection for them all. It was also his plan to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shorten their journey by cutting across another great loop of the Road: east<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">beyond Weathertop it changed its course and took a wide bend northwards.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They made their way slowly and cautiously round the south-western<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">slopes of the hill, and came in a little while to the edge of the Road.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There was no sign of the Riders. But even as they were hurrying across they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">heard far away two cries: a cold voice calling and a cold voice answering.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Trembling they sprang forward, and made for the thickets that lay ahead. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">land before them sloped away southwards, but it was wild and pathless;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">bushes and stunted trees grew in dense patches with wide barren spaces in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">between. The grass was scanty, coarse, and grey; and the leaves in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">thickets were faded and falling. It was a cheerless land, and their journey<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was slow and gloomy. They spoke little as they trudged along. Frodo's heart<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was grieved as he watched them walking beside him with their heads down,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">their backs bowed under their burdens. Even Strider seemed tired and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">heavy-hearted.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Before the first day's march was over Frodo's pain began to grow again,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">but he did not speak of it for a long time. Four days passed, without the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ground or the scene changing much, except that behind them Weathertop<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">slowly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sank, and before them the distant mountains loomed a little nearer. Yet<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">since that far cry they had seen and heard no sign that the enemy had marked<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">their flight or followed them. They dreaded the dark hours, and kept watch<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in pairs by night, expecting at any time to see black shapes stalking in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">grey night, dimly lit by the cloud- veiled moon; but they saw nothing, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">heard no sound but the sigh of withered leaves and grass. Not once did they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">feel the sense of present evil that had assailed them before the attack in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the dell. It seemed too much to hope that the Riders had already lost their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">trail again. Perhaps they were waiting to make some ambush in a narrow<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">place?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At the end of the fifth day the ground began once more to rise slowly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">out of the wide shallow valley into which they had descended. Strider now<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">turned their course again north-eastwards, and on the sixth day they reached<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the top of a long slow-climbing slope, and saw far ahead a huddle of wooded<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hills. Away below them they could see the Road sweeping round the feet of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the hills; and to their right a grey river gleamed pale in the thin<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sunshine. In the distance they glimpsed yet another river in a stony valley<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">half-veiled in mist.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">"I am afraid we must go back to the Road here for a while,' said<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Strider. 'We have now come to the River Hoarwell, that the Elves call<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mitheithel. It flows down out of the Ettenmoors, the troll-fells north of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Rivendell, and joins the Loud water away in the South. Some call it the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Greyflood after that. It is a great water before it finds the Sea. There is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">no way over it below its sources in the Ettenmoors, except by the Last<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bridge on which the Road crosses.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™What is that other river we can see far away there?' asked Merry.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'That is Loudwater, the Bruinen of Rivendell,' answered Strider. 'The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Road runs along the edge of the hills for many miles from the Bridge to the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Ford of Bruinen. But I have not yet thought how we shall cross that water.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">One river at a time! We shall be fortunate indeed if we do not find the Last<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bridge held against us.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Next day, early in the morning, they came down again to the borders of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Road. Sam and Strider went forward, but they found no sign of any<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">travellers or riders. Here under the shadow of the hills there had been some<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">rain. Strider judged that it had fallen two days before, and had washed away<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">all footprints. No horseman had passed since then, as far as he could see.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They hurried along with all the speed they could make, and after a mile<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">or two they saw the Last Bridge ahead, at the bottom of a short steep slope.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They dreaded to see black figures waiting there, but they saw none. Strider<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">made them take cover in a thicket at the side of the Road, while he went<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">forward to explore.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Before long he came hurrying back. 'I can see no sign of the enemy,' he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">said, 'and I wonder very much what that means. But I have found something<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">very strange.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He held out his hand, and showed a single pale-green jewel. 'I found it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in the mud in the middle of the Bridge,' he said. 'It is a beryl, an<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">elf-stone. Whether it was set there, or let fall by chance, I cannot say;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">but it brings hope to me. I will take it as a sign that we may pass the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bridge; but beyond that I dare not keep to the Road, without some clearer<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">token.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At once they went on again. They crossed the Bridge in safety, hearing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">no sound but the water swirling against its three great arches. A mile<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">further on they came to a narrow ravine that led away northwards through the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">steep lands on the left of the Road. Here Strider turned aside, and soon<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they were lost in a sombre country of dark trees winding among the feet of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sullen hills.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The hobbits were glad to leave the cheerless lands and the perilous<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Road behind them; but this new country seemed threatening and unfriendly. As<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they went forward the hills about them steadily rose. Here and there upon<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">heights and ridges they caught glimpses of ancient walls of stone, and the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ruins of towers: they had an ominous look. Frodo, who was not walking, had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">time to gaze ahead and to think. He recalled Bilbo's account of his journey<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and the threatening towers on the hills north of the Road, in the country<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">near the Troll's wood where his first serious adventure had happened. Frodo<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">guessed that they were now in the same region, and wondered if by chance<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they would pass near the spot.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Who lives in this land?' he asked. 'And who built these towers? Is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">this troll-country?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'No!' said Strider. 'Trolls do not build. No one lives in this land.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Men once dwelt here, ages ago; but none remain now. They became an evil<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">people, as legends tell, for they fell under the shadow of Angmar. But all<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were destroyed in the war that brought the North Kingdom to its end. But<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that is now so long ago that the hills have forgotten them, though a shadow<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">still lies on the land.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Where did you learn such tales, if all the land is empty and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">forgetful?' asked Peregrin. 'The birds and beasts do not tell tales of that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">son.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'The heirs of Elendil do not forget all things past,' said Strider;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'and many more things than I can tell are remembered in Rivendell.' 'Have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you often been to Rivendell?' said Frodo. 'I have,' said Strider. 'I dwelt<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">there once, and still I return when I may.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There my heart is; but it is not my fate to sit in peace, even in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fair house of Elrond.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The hills now began to shut them in. The Road behind held on its way to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the River Bruinen, but both were now hidden from view. The travellers came<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">into a long valley; narrow, deeply cloven, dark and silent. Trees with old<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and twisted roots hung over cliffs, and piled up behind into mounting slopes<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of pine-wood.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The hobbits grew very weary. They advanced slowly, for they had to pick<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">their way through a pathless country, encumbered by fallen trees and tumbled<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">rocks. As long as they could they avoided climbing for Frodo's sake, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">because it was in fact difficult to find any way up out of the narrow dales.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They had been two days in this country when the weather turned wet. The wind<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">began to blow steadily out of the West and pour the water of the distant<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">seas on the dark heads of the hills in fine drenching rain. By nightfall<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they were all soaked, and their camp was cheerless, for they could not get<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">any fire to burn. The next day the hills rose still higher and steeper<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">before them, and they were forced to turn away northwards out of their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">course. Strider seemed to be getting anxious: they were nearly ten days out<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">from Weathertop, and their stock of provisions was beginning to run low. It<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">went on raining.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">That night they camped on a stony shelf with a rock -wall behind them,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in which there was a shallow cave, a mere scoop in the cliff. Frodo was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">restless. The cold and wet had made his wound more painful than ever, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the ache and sense of deadly chill took away all sleep. He lay tossing and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">turning and listening fearfully to the stealthy night-noises: wind in chinks<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of rock, water dripping, a crack, the sudden rattling fall of a loosened<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stone. He felt that black shapes were advancing to smother him; but when he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sat up he saw nothing but the back of Strider sitting hunched up, smoking<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his pipe, and watching. He lay down again and passed into an uneasy dream,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in which he walked on the grass in his garden in the Shire, but it seemed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">faint and dim, less clear than the tall black shadows that stood looking<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">over the hedge.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the morning he woke to find that the rain had stopped. The clouds<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were still thick, but they were breaking, and pale strips of blue appeared<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">between them. The wind was shifting again. They did not start early.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Immediately after their cold and comfortless breakfast Strider went off<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">alone, telling the others to remain under the shelter of the cliff, until he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">came back. He was going to climb up, if he could, and get a look at the lie<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of the land.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">When he returned he was not reassuring. 'We have come too far to the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">north,' he said, 'and we must find some way to turn back southwards again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">If we keep on as we are going we shall get up into the Ettendales far north<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of Rivendell. That is troll-country, and little known to me. We could<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">perhaps find our way through and come round to Rivendell from the north; but<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it would take too long, for I do not know the way, and our food would not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">last. So somehow or other we must find the Ford of Bruinen.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The rest of that day they spent scrambling over rocky ground. They<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">found a passage between two hills that led them into a valley running<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">south-east, the direction that they wished to take; but towards the end of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the day they found their road again barred by a ridge of high land; its dark<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">edge against the sky was broken into many bare points like teeth of a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">blunted saw. They had a choice between going back or climbing over it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They decided to attempt the climb, but it proved very difficult. Before<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">long Frodo was obliged to dismount and struggle along on foot. Even so they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">often despaired of getting their pony up, or indeed of finding a path for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">themselves, burdened as they were. The light was nearly gone, and they were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">all exhausted, when at last they reached the top. They had climbed on to a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">narrow saddle between two higher points, and the land fell steeply away<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">again, only a short distance ahead. Frodo threw himself down, and lay on the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ground shivering. His left arm was lifeless, and his side and shoulder felt<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">as if icy claws were laid upon them. The trees and rocks about him seemed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shadowy and dim.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'We cannot go any further,' said Merry to Strider. 'I am afraid this<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">has been too much for Frodo. I am dreadfully anxious about him. What are we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to do? Do you think they will be able to cure him in Ri vendell, if we ever<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">get there?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'We shall see,' answered Strider. 'There is nothing more that I can do<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in the wilderness; and it is chiefly because of his wound that I am so<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">anxious to press on. But I agree that we can go no further tonight.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'What is the matter with my master?' asked Sam in a low voice, looking<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">appealingly at Strider. 'His wound was small, and it is already closed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There's nothing to be seen but a cold white mark on his shoulder.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Frodo has been touched by the weapons of the Enemy,' said Strider,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'and there is some poison or evil at work that is beyond my skill to drive<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">out. But do not give up hope, Sam!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Night was cold up on the high ridge. They lit a small fire down under<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the gnarled roots of an old pine, that hung over a shallow pit: it looked as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">if stone had once been quarried there. They sat huddled together. The wind<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">blew chill through the pass, and they heard the tree-tops lower down moaning<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and sighing. Frodo lay half in a dream, imagining that endless dark wings<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were sweeping by above him, and that on the wings rode pursuers that sought<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">him in all the hollows of the hill s.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The morning dawned bright and fair; the air was clean, and the light<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">pale and clear in a rain- washed sky. Their hearts were encouraged, but (hey<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">longed for the sun to warm their cold stiff limbs. As soon as it was light,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Strider took Merry with him and went to survey the country from the height<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to the east of the pass. The sun had risen and was shining brightly when he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">returned with more comforting news. They were now going more or less in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">right direction. If they went on, down the further side of the ridge, they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">would have the Mountains on their left. Some way ahead Strider had caught a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">glimpse of the Loudwater again, and he knew that, though it was hidden from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">view, the Road to the Ford was not far from the River and lay on the side<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">nearest to them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'We must make for the Road again,' he said. 'We cannot hope to find a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">path through these hills. Whatever danger may beset it, the Road is our only<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">way to the Ford.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As soon as they had eaten they set out again. They climbed slowly down<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the southern side of the ridge; but the way was much easier than they had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">expected, for the slope was far less steep on this side, and before long<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo was able to ride again. Bill Ferny's poor old pony was developing an<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">unexpected talent for picking out a path, and for sparing its rider as many<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">jolts as possible. The spirits of the party rose again. Even Frodo felt<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">better in the morning light, but every now and again a mist seemed to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">obscure his sight, and he passed his hands over his eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Pippin was a little ahead of the others. Suddenly he turned round and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">called to them. 'There is a path here!' he cried.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">When they came up with him, they saw that he had made no mistake:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">there were clearly the beginnings of a path, that climbed with many<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">windings out of the woods below and faded away on the hill-top behind. In<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">places it was now faint and overgrown, or choked with fallen stones and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">trees; but at one time it seemed to have been much used. It was a path made<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">by strong arms and heavy feet. Here and there old trees had been cut or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">broken down, and large rocks cloven or heaved aside to make a way.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They followed the track for some while, for it offered much the easiest<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">way down, but they went cautiously, and their anxiety increased as they came<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">into the dark woods, and the path grew plainer and broader. Suddenly coming<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">out of a belt of fir-trees it ran steeply down a slope, and turned sharply<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to the left round the comer of a rocky shoulder of the hill. When they came<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to the comer they looked round and saw that the path ran on over a level<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">strip under the face of a low cliff overhung with trees. In the stony wall<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">there was a door hanging crookedly ajar upon one great hinge.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Outside the door they all halted. There was a cave or rock-chamber<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">behind, but in the gloom inside nothing could be seen. Strider, Sam, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Merry pushing with all their strength managed to open the door a little<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wider, and then Strider and Merry went in. They did not go far, for on the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">floor lay many old bones, and nothing else was to be seen near the entrance<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">except some great empty jars and broken pots.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Surely this is a troll-hole, if ever there was one!' said Pippin.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™Come out, you two, and let us get away. Now we know who made the path -<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">we had better get off it quick.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'There is no need, I think,' said Strider, coining out. 'It is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">certainly a troll-hole, but it seems to have been long forsaken. I don't<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">think we need be afraid. But let us go on down warily, and we shall see.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The path went on again from the door, and turning to the right again<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">across the level space plunged down a thick wooded slope. Pippin, not liking<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to show Strider that he was still afraid, went on ahead with Merry. Sam and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Strider came behind, one on each side of Frodo's pony, for the path was now<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">broad enough for four or five hobbits to walk abreast. But they had not gone<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">very far before Pippin came running back, followed by Merry. They both<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">looked terrified.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'There are trolls!' Pippin panted. 'Down in a clearing in the woods not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">far below. We got a sight of them through the tree-trunks. They are very<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">large!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'We will come and look at them,' said Strider, picking up a stick.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo said nothing, but Sam looked scared.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The sun was now high, and it shone down through the half-stripped<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">branches of the trees, and lit the clearing with bright patches of light.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They halted suddenly on the edge, and peered through the tree-trunks,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">holding their breath. There stood the trolls: three large trolls. One was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stooping, and the other two stood staring at him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Strider walked forward unconcernedly. 'Get up, old stone!' he said, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">broke his stick upon the stooping troll.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Nothing happened. There was a gasp of astonishment from the hobbits,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and then even Frodo laughed. 'Well!' he said. 'We are forgetting our family<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">history! These must be the very three that were caught by Gandalf,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">quarrelling over the right way to cook thirteen dwarves and one hobbit.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I had no idea we were anywhere near the place!' said Pippin. He knew<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the story well. Bilbo and Frodo had told it often; but as a matter of fact<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he had never more than half believed it. Even now he looked at the stone<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">trolls with suspicion, wondering if some magic might not suddenly bring them<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to life again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You are forgetting not only your family history, but all you ever knew<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">about trolls,' said Strider. 'It is broad daylight with a bright sun, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">yet you come back trying to scare me with a tale of live trolls waiting for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">us in this glade! In any case you might have noticed that one of them has an<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">old bird's nest behind his ear. That would be a most unusual ornament for a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">live troll!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They all laughed. Frodo felt his spirits reviving: the reminder of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bilbo's first successful adventure was heartening. The sun, too, was warm<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and comforting, and the mist before his eyes seemed to be lifting a little.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They rested for some time in the glade, and took their mid-day meal right<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">under the shadow of the trolls' large legs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Won't somebody give us a bit of a song, while the sun is high?' said<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Merry, when they had finished. 'We haven't had a song or a tale for days.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Not since Weathertop,' said Frodo. The others looked at him. 'Don't<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">worry about me!' he added. 'I feel much better, but I don't think I could<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sing. Perhaps Sam could dig something out of his memory.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Come on, Sam!' said Merry. 'There's more stored in your head than you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">let on about.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I don't know about that,' said Sam. 'But how would this suit? It ain't<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">what I call proper poetry, if you understand me: just a bit of nonsense. But<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">these old images here brought it to my mind.' Standing up, with his hands<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">behind his back, as if he was at school, he began to sing to an old tune.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Troll sat alone on his seat of stone,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And munched and mumbled a bare old bone;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For many a year he had gnawed it near,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For meat was hard to come by.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Done by! Gum by!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In a case in the hills he dwelt alone,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And meat was hard to come by.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Up came Tom with his big boots on.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Said he to Troll: 'Pray, what is yon?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For it looks like the shin o' my nuncle Tim,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As should be a-lyin ' in graveyard.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">This many a year has Tim been gone,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'My lad, ' said Troll, 'this bone I stole.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But what be bones that lie in a hole?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Thy nuncle was dead as a lump o' lead,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Afore I found his shinbone.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Tinbone! Thinbone!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He can spare a share for a poor old troll,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For he don't need his shinbone. '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Said Tom: 7 don't see why the likes o' thee<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Without axin ' leave should go makin 'free<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">With the shank or the shin o' my father's kin;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Though dead he be, it belongs to he;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">So hand the old bone over!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'For a couple o' pins,' says Troll, and grins,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I'll eat thee too, and gnaw thy shins.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A bit o' fresh meal will go down sweet!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I'll try my teeth on thee now.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Hee now! See now!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I'm tired o' gnawing old bones and skins;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I've a mind to dine on thee now. '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But just as he thought his dinner was caught,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He found his hands had hold of naught.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Before he could mind, Tom slipped behind<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And gave him the boot to lam him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Warn him! Darn him!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A bump o' the boot on the seat, Tom thought,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Would be the way to lam him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But harder than stone is the flesh and bone<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Of a troll that sits in the hills alone.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As well set your boot to the mountain's root,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For the seat of a troll don 't feel it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Peel it! Heal it!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Old Troll laughed, when he heard Tom groan,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And he knew his toes could feel it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But Troll don't care, and he's still there<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">course,' said Frodo. 'I am learning a lot about Sam Gamgee on this journey.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">following the very track that Gandalf, Bilbo, and the dwarves had used many<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">years before. After a few miles they came out on the top of a high bank<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">above the Road. At this point the Road had left the Hoarwell far behind in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">its narrow valley, and now clung close to the feet of the hills, rolling and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">winding eastward among woods and heather -covered slopes towards the Ford<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Mountains. Not far down the bank Strider pointed out a stone in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">grass. On it roughly cut and now much weathered could still be seen<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dwarf-runes and secret marks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'There!' said Merry. 'That must be the stone that marked the place<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">where the trolls' gold was hidden. How much is left of Bilbo's share, I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wonder, Frodo?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo looked at the stone, and wished that Bilbo had brought home no<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">treasure more perilous, nor less easy to pan with. 'None at all,' he said.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Bilbo gave it all away. He told me he did not feel it was really his, as it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">came from robbers.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Road lay quiet under the long shadows of early evening. There was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">no sign of any other travellers to be seen. As there was now no other<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">possible course for them to take, they climbed down the bank, and turning<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">left went off as fast as they could. Soon a shoulder of the hills cut off<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the light of the fast westering sun. A cold wind flowed down to meet them<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">from the mountains ahead.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They were beginning to look out for a place off the Road, where they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">could camp for the night, when they heard a sound that brought sudden fear<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">back into their hearts: the noise of hoofs behind them. They looked back,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">but they could not see far because of the many windings and rollings of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Road. As quickly as they could they scrambled off the beaten way and up into<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the deep heather and bilberry brushwood on the slopes above, until they came<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to a small patch of thick-growing hazels. As they peered out from among the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">bushes, they could see the Road, faint and grey in the failing light, some<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">thirty feel below them. The sound of hoofs drew nearer. They were going<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fast, with a light clippety-clippely-clip. Then faintly, as if it was blown<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">away from them by the breeze, they seemed to catch a dim ringing, as of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">small bells tinkling.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">That does not sound like a Black Rider's horse!' said Frodo, listening<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">intently. The other hobbits agreed hopefully that it did not, but they all<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">remained full of suspicion. They had been in fear of pursuit for so long<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that any sound from behind seemed ominous and unfriendly. But Strider was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">now leaning forward, stooped to the ground, with a hand to his ear, and a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">look of joy on his face.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The light faded, and the leaves on the bushes rustled softly. Clearer<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and nearer now the bells jingled, and clippety-clip came the quick trotting<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">feet. Suddenly into view below came a white horse, gleaming in the shadows,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">running swiftly. In the dusk its headstall flickered and flashed, as if it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were studded with gems like living stars. The rider's cloak streamed behind<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">him, and his hood was thrown back; his golden hair flowed shimmering in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wind of his speed. To Frodo it appeared that a white light was shining<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">through the form and raiment of the rider, as if through a thin veil.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Strider sprang from hiding and dashed down towards the Road, leaping<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with a cry through the heather; but even before he had moved or called, the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">rider had reined in his horse and halted, looking up towards the thicket<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">where they stood. When he saw Strider, he dismounted and ran to meet him<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">calling out: Ai na vedui DÂ®nadan! Mae govannen! His speech and clear<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ringing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">voice left no doubt in their hearts: the rider was of the Elven-folk. No<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">others that dwelt in the wide world had voices so fair to hear. But there<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">seemed to be a note of haste or fear in his call, and they saw that he was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">now speaking quickly and urgently to Strider.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Soon Strider beckoned to them, and the hobbits left the bushes and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hurried down to the Road. 'This is Glorfindel, who dwells in the house of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Elrond,' said Strider.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Hail, and well met at last!' said the Elf-lord to Frodo. 'I was sent<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">from Rivendell to look for you. We feared that you were in danger upon the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">road.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Then Gandalf has reached Rivendell?' cried Frodo joyfully.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'No. He had not when I departed; but that was nine days ago,' answered<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Glorfindel. 'Elrond received news that troubled him. Some of my kindred,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">journeying in your land beyond the Baranduin,* learned that things were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">amiss, and sent messages as swiftly as they could. They said that the Nine<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were abroad, and that you were astray bearing a great burden without<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">guidance, for Gandalf had not returned. There are few even in Rivendell that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">can ride openly against the Nine; but such as there were, Elrond sent out<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">north, west, and south. It was thought that you might turn far aside to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">avoid pursuit, and become lost in the Wilderness.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'It was my lot to take the Road, and I came to the Bridge of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mitheithel, and left a token there, nigh on seven days ago. Three of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">servants of Sauron were upon the Bridge, but they withdrew and I pursued<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">them westward. I came also upon two others, but they turned away southward.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Since then I have searched for your trail. Two days ago I found it, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">followed it over the Bridge; and today I marked where you descended from the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hills again. But come! There is no time for further news. Since you are here<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">we must risk the peril of the Road and go. There are five behind us, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">when they find your trail upon the Road they will ride after us like the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wind. And they are not all. Where the other four may be, I do not know. I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fear that we may find the Ford is already held against us.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">While Glorfindel was speaking the shades of evening deepened. Frodo<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">felt a great weariness come over him. Ever since the sun began to sink the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mist before his eyes had darkened, and he felt that a shadow was coming<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">between him and the faces of his friends. Now pain assailed him, and he felt<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">cold. He swayed, clutching at Sam's arm.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'My master is sick and wounded,' said Sam angrily. 'He can't go on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">riding after nightfall. He needs rest.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Glorfindel caught Frodo as he sank to the ground, and taking him gently<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in his arms he looked in his face with grave anxiety.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Briefly Strider told of the attack on their camp under Weathertop, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of the deadly knife. He drew out the hilt, which he had kept, and handed it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to the Elf. Glorfindel shuddered as he took it, but he looked intently at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'There are evil things written on this hilt,' he said; 'though maybe<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">your eyes cannot see them. Keep it, Aragorn, till we reach the house of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Elrond! But be wary, and handle it as little as you may! Alas! the wounds of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">this weapon are beyond my skill to heal. I will do what I can - but all the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">more do I urge you now to go on without rest.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He searched the wound on Frodo's shoulder with his fingers, and his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">face grew graver, as if what he learned disquieted him. But Frodo felt the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">chill lessen in his side and arm; a little warmth crept down from his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shoulder to his hand, and the pain grew easier. The dusk of evening seemed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to grow lighter about him, as if a cloud had been withdrawn. He saw his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">friends' faces more clearly again, and a measure of new hope and strength<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">returned.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You shall ride my horse,' said Glorfindel. 'I will shorten the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stirrups up to the saddle-skins, and you must sit as tight as you can. But<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you need not fear: my horse will not let any rider fall that I command him<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to bear. His pace is light and smooth; and if danger presses too near, he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">will bear you away with a speed that even the black steeds of the enemy<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">cannot rival.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'No, he will not!' said Frodo. 'I shall not ride him, if I am to be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">carried off to Rivendell or anywhere else, leaving my friends behind in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">danger.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Glorfindel smiled. 'I doubt very much,' he said, 'if your friends would<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">be in danger if you were not with them! The pursuit would follow you and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">leave us in peace, I think. It is you, Frodo, and that which you bear that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">brings us all in peril.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">To that Frodo had no answer, and he was persuaded to mount Glorfindel's<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">white horse. The pony was laden instead with a great part of the others'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">burdens, so that they now marched lighter, and for a time made good speed;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">but the hobbits began to find it hard to keep up with the swift tireless<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">feet of the Elf. On he led them, into the mouth of darkness, and still on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">under the deep clouded night. There was neither star nor moon. Not until the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">grey of dawn did he allow them to halt. Pippin, Merry, and Sam were by that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">time nearly asleep on their stumbling legs; and even Strider seemed by the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sag of his shoulders to be weary. Frodo sat upon the horse in a dark dream.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They cast themselves down in the heather a few yards from the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">road-side, and fell asleep immediately. They seemed hardly to have closed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">their eyes when Glorfindel, who had set himself to watch while they slept,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">awoke them again. The sun had now climbed far into the morning, and the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">clouds and mists of the night were gone.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Drink this!' said Glorfindel to them, pouring for each in turn a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">little liquor from his silver-studded flask of leather. It was clear as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">spring water and had no taste, and it did not feel either cool or warm in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the mouth; but strength and vigour seemed to flow into all their limbs as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they drank it. Eaten after that draught the stale bread and dried fruit<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">(which was now all that they had left) seemed to satisfy their hunger better<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">than many a good breakfast in the Shire had done.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They had rested rather less than five hours when they took to the Road<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">again. Glorfindel still urged them on, and only allowed two brief halts<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">during the day's march. In this way they covered almost twenty miles before<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">nightfall, and came to a point where the Road bent right and ran down<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">towards the bottom of the valley, now making straight for the Bruinen. So<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">far there had been no sign or sound of pursuit that the hobbits could see or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hear; but often Glorfindel would halt and listen for a moment, if they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">lagged behind, and a look of anxiety clouded his face. Once or twice he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">spoke to Strider in the elf-tongue.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But however anxious their guides might be, it was plain that the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hobbits could go no further that night. They were stumbling along dizzy with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">weariness, and unable to think of anything but their feet and legs. Frodo's<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">pain had redoubled, and during the day things about him faded to shadows of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ghostly grey. He almost welcomed the coming of night, for then the world<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">seemed less pale and empty.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The hobbits were still weary, when they set out again early next<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">morning. There were many miles yet to go between them and the Ford, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hobbled forward at the best pace they could manage.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Our peril will be greatest just ere we reach the river,' said<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Glorfindel; 'for my heart warns me that the pursuit is now swift behind us,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and other danger may be waiting by the Ford.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Road was still running steadily downhill, and there was now in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">places much grass at either side, in which the hobbits walked when they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">could, to ease their tired feet. In the late afternoon they came to a place<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">where the Road went suddenly under the dark shadow of tall pine-trees, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">then plunged into a deep cutting with steep moist walls of red stone. Echoes<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ran along as they hurried forward; and there seemed to be a sound of many<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">footfalls following their own. All at once, as if through a gate of light,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Road ran out again from the end of the tunnel into the open. There at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the bottom of a sharp incline they saw before them a long flat mile, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">beyond that the Ford of Rivendell. On the further side was a steep brown<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">bank, threaded by a winding path; and behind that the tall mountains<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">climbed, shoulder above shoulder, and peak beyond peak, into the fading sky.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There was still an echo as of following feet in the cutting behind<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">them; a rushing noise as if a wind were rising and pouring through the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">branches of the pines. One moment Glorfindel turned and listened, then he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sprang forward with a loud cry.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Fly!' he called. 'Fly! The enemy is upon us!â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The white horse leaped forward. The hobbits ran down the slope.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Glorfindel and Strider followed as rear -guard. They were only half way<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">across the flat, when suddenly there was a noise of horses galloping. Out of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the gate in the trees that they had just left rode a Black Rider. He reined<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his horse in, and halted, swaying in his saddle. Another followed him, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">then another; then again two more.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™Ride forward! Ride!' cried Glorfindel to Frodo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He did not obey at once, for a strange reluctance seized him. Checking<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the horse to a walk, he turned and looked back. The Riders seemed to sit<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">upon their great steeds like threatening statues upon a hill, dark and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">solid, while all the woods and land about them receded as if into a mist.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Suddenly he knew in his heart that they were silently commanding him to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wait. Then at once fear and hatred awoke in him. His hand left the bridle<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and gripped the hilt of his sword, and with a red flash he drew it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Ride on! Ride on!' cried Glorfindel, and then loud and clear he called<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to the horse in the elf-tongue: noro lim, noro lim, Asfaloth!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At once the white horse sprang away and sped like the wind along the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">last lap of the Road. At the same moment the black horses leaped down the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hill in pursuit, and from the Riders came a terrible cry, such as Frodo had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">heard filling the woods with horror in the Eastfarthing far away. It was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">answered; and to the dismay of Frodo and his friends out from the trees and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">rocks away on the left four other Riders came flying. Two rode towards<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo: two galloped madly towards the Ford to cut off his escape. They<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">seemed to him to run like the wind and to grow swiftly larger and darker, as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">their courses converged with his.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo looked back for a moment over his shoulder. He could no longer<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">see his friends. The Riders behind were falling back: even their great<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">steeds were no match in speed for the white elf-horse of Glorfindel. He<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">looked forward again, and hope faded. There seemed no chance of reaching the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Ford before he was cut off by the others that had lain in ambush. He could<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">see them clearly now: they appeared to have cast aside their hoods and black<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">cloaks, and they were robed in white and grey. Swords were naked in their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">pale hands; helms were on their heads. Their cold eyes glittered, and they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">called to him with fell voices.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Fear now filled all Frodo's mind. He thought no longer of his sword. No<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">cry came from him. He shut his eyes and clung to the horse's mane. The wind<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">whistled in his ears, and the bells upon the harness rang wild and shrill. A<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">breath of deadly cold pierced him like a spear, as with a last spurt, like a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">flash of white fire, the elf-horse speeding as if on wings, passed right<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">before the face of the foremost Rider.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo heard the splash of water. It foamed about his feet. He felt the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">quick heave and surge as the horse left the river and struggled up the stony<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">path. He was climbing the steep bank. He was across the Ford.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But the pursuers were close behind. At the top of the bank the horse<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">halted and turned about neighing fiercely. There were Nine Riders at the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">water's edge below, and Frodo's spirit quailed before the threat of their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">uplifted faces. He knew of nothing that would prevent them from crossing as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">easily as he had done; and he felt that it was useless to try to escape over<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the long uncertain path from the Ford to the edge of Rivendell, if once the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Riders crossed. In any case he felt that he was commanded urgently to halt.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Hatred again stirred in him, but he had no longer the strength to refuse.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Suddenly the foremost Rider spurred his horse forward. It checked at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the water and reared up. With a great effort Frodo sat upright and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">brandished his sword.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Go back!' he cried. 'Go back to the Land of Mordor, and follow me no<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">more! ' His voice sounded thin and shrill in his own ears. The Riders<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">halted, but Frodo had not the power of Bombadil. His enemies laughed at him<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with a harsh and chilling laughter. 'Come back! Come back!' they called. 'To<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mordor we will take you!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™Go back!' he whispered.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Ring! The Ring!' they cried with deadly voices; and immediately<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">their leader urged his horse forward into the water, followed closely by two<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">others.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'By Elbereth and LÂ®thien the Fair,' said Frodo with a last effort,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">lifting up his sword, 'you shall have neither the Ring nor me!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Then the leader, who was now half across the Ford, stood up menacing in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his stirrups, and raised up his hand. Frodo was stricken dumb. He felt his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">tongue cleave to his mouth, and his heart labouring. His sword broke and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fell out of his shaking hand. The elf-horse reared and snorted. The foremost<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of the black horses had almost set foot upon the shore.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At that moment there came a roaring and a rushing: a noise of loud<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">waters rolling many stones. Dimly Frodo saw the river below him rise, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">down along its course there came a plumed cavalry of waves. White flames<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">seemed to Frodo to flicker on their crests and he half fancied that he saw<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">amid the water white riders upon white horses with frothing manes. The three<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Riders that were still in the midst of the Ford were overwhelmed: they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">disappeared, buried suddenly under angry foam. Those that were behind drew<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">back in dismay.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">With his last failing senses Frodo heard cries, and it seemed to him<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that he saw, beyond the Riders that hesitated on the shore, a shining figure<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of white light; and behind it ran small shadowy forms waving flames, that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">flared red in the grey mist that was falling over the world.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The black horses were filled with madness, and leaping forward in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">terror they bore their riders into the rushing flood. Their piercing cries<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were drowned in the roaring of the river as it carried them away. Then Frodo<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">felt himself falling, and the roaring and confusion seemed to rise and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">engulf him together with his enemies. He heard and saw no more.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo woke and found himself lying in bed. At first he thought that he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">had slept late, after a long unpleasant dream that still hovered on the edge<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of memory. Or perhaps he had been ill? But the ceiling looked strange; it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was flat, and it had dark beams richly carved. He lay a little while longer<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">looking at patches of sunlight on the wall, and listening to the sound of a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">waterfall.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Where am I, and what is the time?' he said aloud to the ceiling. 'In<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the House of Elrond, and it is ten o'clock in the morning.' said a voice.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'It is the morning of October the twenty -fourth, if you want to know.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Gandalf!' cried Frodo, sitting up. There was the old wizard, sitting<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in a chair by the open window.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Yes,' he said, 'I am here. And you are lucky to be here, too, after<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">all the absurd things you have done since you left home.' Frodo lay down<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">again. He felt too comfortable and peaceful to argue, and in any case he did<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">not think he would get the better of an argument. He was fully awake now,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and the memory of his journey was returning: the disastrous 'short cut'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">through the Old Forest the 'accident' at The Prancing Pony ; and his madness<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in putting on the Ring in the dell under Weathertop. While he was thinking<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of all these things and trying in vain to bring his memory down to his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">arriving in Rivendell, there was a long silence, broken only by the soft<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">puffs of Gandalf s pipe, as he blew white smoke -rings out of the window.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Where's Sam?' Frodo asked at length. 'And are the others all right?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Yes, they are all safe and sound,' answered Gandalf. 'Sam was here<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">until I sent him off to get some rest, about half an hour ago.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'What happened at the Ford?' said Frodo. 'It all seemed so dim somehow;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and it still does.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Yes, it would. You were beginning to fade,' answered Gandalf. 'The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wound was overcoming you at last. A few more hours and you would have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">been<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">beyond our aid. But you have some strength in you, my dear hobbit! As you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">showed in the Barrow. That was touch and go: perhaps the most dangerous<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">moment of all. I wish you could have held out at Weathertop.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You seem to know a great deal already,' said Frodo. 'I have not spoken<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to the others about the Barrow. At first it was too horrible; and afterwards<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">there were other things to think about. How do you know about it?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You have talked long in your sleep, Frodo,' said Gandalf gently, 'and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it has not been hard for me to read your mind and memory. Do not worry!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Though I said "absurd" just now, I did not mean it. I think well of you-and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of the others. It is no small feat to have come so far, and through such<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dangers, still bearing the Ring.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'We should never have done it without Strider,' said Frodo. 'But we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">needed you. I did not know what to do without you.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I was delayed,' said Gandalf, 'and that nearly proved our ruin. And<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">yet I am not sure; it may have been better so.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I wish you would tell me what happened!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'All in good time! You are not supposed to talk or worry about anything<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">today, by Elrond's orders.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'But talking would stop me thinking and wondering, which are quite as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">tiring,â€™ said Frodo. â€™I am wide awake now, and I remember so many things<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that want explaining. Why were you delayed? You ought to tell me that at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">least.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You will soon hear all you wish to know,' said Gandalf. 'We shall have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a Council, as soon as you are well enough. At the moment I will only say<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that I was held captive.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You?' cried Frodo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Yes, I, Gandalf the Grey,' said the wizard solemnly. 'There are many<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">powers in the world, for good or for evil. Some are greater than I am.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Against some I have not yet been measured. But my time is coming. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Morgul-lord and his Black Riders have come forth. War is preparing!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Then you knew of the Riders already -before I met them?â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Yes, I knew of them. Indeed I spoke of them once to you; for the Black<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Riders are the Ringwraiths, the Nine Servants of the Lord of the Rings. But<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I did not know that they had arisen again or I should have fled with you at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">once. I heard news of them only after I left you in June; but that story<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">must wait. For the moment we have been saved from disaster, by Aragorn.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Yes,' said Frodo, 'it was Strider that saved us. Yet I was afraid of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">him at first. Sam never quite trusted him. I think, not at any rate until we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">met Glorfindel.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gandalf smiled. V I have heard all about Sam,' he said. 'He has no more<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">doubts now.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I am glad,' said Frodo. 'For I have become very fond of Strider. Well,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fond is not the right word. I mean he is dear to me; though he is strange,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and grim at times. In fact, he reminds me often of you. I didn't know that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">any of the Big People were like that. I thought, well, that they were just<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">big, and rather stupid: kind and stupid like Butterbur; or stupid and wicked<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">like Bill Ferny. But then we don't know much about Men in the Shire, except<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">perhaps the Breelanders.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You don't know much even about them, if you think old Barliman is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stupid,' said Gandalf. 'He is wise enough on his own ground. He thinks less<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">than he talks, and slower; yet he can see through a brick wall in time (as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they say in Bree). But there are few left in Middle-earth like Aragorn son<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of Arathorn. The race of the Kings from over the Sea is nearly at an end. It<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">may be that this War of the Ring will be their last adventure.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Do you really mean that Strider is one of the people of the old<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Kings?' said Frodo in wonder. 'I thought they had all vanished long ago. I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">thought he was only a Ranger.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Only a Ranger!' cried Gandalf. 'My dear Frodo, that is just what the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Rangers are: the last remnant in the North of the great people, the Men of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the West. They have helped me before; and I shall need their help in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">days to come; for we have reached Rivendell, but the Ring is not yet at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">rest.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I suppose not,' said Frodo. 'But so far my only thought has been to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">get here; and I hope I shan't have to go any further. It is very pleasant<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">just to rest. I have had a month of exile and adventure, and I find that has<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">been as much as I want.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He fell silent and shut his eyes. After a while he spoke again. 'I have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">been reckoning,' he said, 'and I can't bring the total up to October the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">twenty-fourth. It ought to be the twenty-first. We must have reached the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Ford by the twentieth.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You have talked and reckoned more than is good for you,' said Gandalf.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'How do the side and shoulder feel now?â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™I don't know.' Frodo answered. 'They don't feel at all: which is an<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">improvement, but'â€” he made an effortâ€” 'I can move my arm again a little.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Yes, it is coming back to life. It is not cold,' he added, touching his left<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hand with his right.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Good!' said Gandalf. "It is mending fast. You will soon be sound<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">again. Elrond has cured you: he has tended you for days, ever since you were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">brought in.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Days?' said Frodo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well, four nights and three days, to be exact. The Elves brought you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">from this where you lost count. We have been terribly anxious, and Sam has<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hardly left your side, day or night, except to run messages. Elrond is a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">master of healing, but the weapons of our Enemy are deadly. To tell you the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">truth, I had very little hope; for I suspected that there was some fragment<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of the blade still in the closed wound. But it could not be found until last<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">night. Then Elrond removed a splinter. It was deeply buried, and it was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">working inwards.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo shuddered, remembering the cruel knife with notched blade that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">had vanished in Strider's hands. 'Don't be alarmed!' said Gandalf. 'It is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">gone now. It has been melted. And it seems that Hobbits fade very<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">reluctantly. I have known strong warriors of the Big People who would<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">quickly have been overcome by that splinter, which you bore for seventeen<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">days.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'What would they have done to me?â€™ asked Frodo. 'What were the Riders<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">trying to do?â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'They tried to pierce your heart with a Morgul-knife which remains in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the wound. If they had succeeded, you would have become like they are, only<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">weaker and under their command. You would have became a wraith under<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dominion of the Dark Lord; and he would have tormented you for trying to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">keep his Ring, if any greater torment were possible than being robbed of it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and seeing it on his hand.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Thank goodness I did not realize the horrible danger!' said Frodo<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">faintly. I was mortally afraid, of course; but if I had known more, I should<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">not have dared even to move. It is a marvel that I escaped!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Yes, fortune or fate have helped you,' said Gandalf, 'not to mention<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">courage. For your heart was not touched, and only your shoulder was pierced;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and that was because you resisted to the last. But it was a terribly narrow<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shave, so to speak. You were in gravest peril while you wore the Ring, for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">then you were half in the wraith- world yourself, and they might have seized<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you. You could see them, and they could see you.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I know,' said Frodo. 'They were terrible to behold! But why could we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">all see their horses?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Because they are real horses; just as the black robes are real robes<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Then why do these black horses endure such riders? All other animals<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">are terrified when they draw near, even the elf-horse of Glorfindel. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dogs howl and the geese scream at them.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Because these horses are born and bred to the service of the Dark Lord<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in Mordor. Not all his servants and chattels are wraiths! There are ores and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">trolls, there are wargs and werewolves; and there have been and still are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">many Men, warriors and kings, that walk alive under the Sun, and yet are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'What about Rivendell and the Elves? Is Rivendell safe?â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Yes, at present, until all else is conquered. The Elves may fear the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">do not fear the Ringwraiths, for those who have dwelt in the Blessed Realm<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">live at once in both worlds, and against both the Seen and the Unseen they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">have great power.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I thought that I saw a white figure that shone and did not grow dim<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">like the others. Was that Glorfindel then?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Yes, you saw him for a moment as he is upon the other side: one of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mighty of the Firstborn. Lie is an Elf-lord of a house of princes. Indeed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">there is a power in Rivendell to withstand the might of Mordor, for a while:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and elsewhere other powers still dwell. There is power, too, of another kind<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in the Shire. But all such places will soon become islands under siege, if<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">things go on as they are going. The Dark Lord is putting forth all his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">strength.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Still,' he said, standing suddenly up and sticking out his chin, while<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his beard went stiff and straight like bristling wire, 'we must keep up our<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">courage. You will soon be well, if I do not talk you to death. You are in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Rivendell, and you need not worry about anything for the present.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I haven't any courage to keep up,' said Frodo, 'but I am not worried<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">at the moment. Just give me news of my friends, and tell me the end of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">affair at the Ford, as I keep on asking, and I shall be content for the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">present. After that I shall have another sleep, I think; but I shan't be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">able to close my eyes until you have finished the story for me.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gandalf moved his chair to the bedside, and took a good look at Frodo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The colour had come back to his face, and his eyes were clear, and fully<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">awake and aware. He was smiling, and there seemed to be little wrong with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">him. But to the wizard's eye there was a faint change just a hint as it were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of transparency, about him, and especially about the left hand that lay<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">outside upon the coverlet.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Still that must be expected,' said Gandalf to himself. 'He is not half<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">through yet, and to what he will come in the end not even Elrond can<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">foretell. Not to evil, I think. He may become like a glass filled with a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">clear light for eyes to see that can.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You look splendid,' he said aloud. 'I will risk a brief tale without<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">consulting Elrond. But quite brief, mind you, and then you must sleep again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">This is what happened, as far as I can gather. The Riders made straight for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you, as soon as you fled. They did not need the guidance of their horses any<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">longer: you had become visible to them, being already on the threshold of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">their world. And also the Ring drew them. Your friends sprang aside, off the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">road, or they would have been ridden down. They knew that nothing could save<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you, if the white horse could not. The Riders were too swift to overtake,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and too many to oppose. On foot even Glorfindel and Aragorn together could<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">not with stand all the Nine at once.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'When the Ring wraiths swept by, your friends ran up behind. Close to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Ford there is a small hollow beside the road masked by a few stunted<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">trees. There they hastily kindled fire; for Glorfindel knew that a flood<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">would come down, if the Riders tried to cross, and then he would have to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">deal with any that were left on his side of the river. The moment the flood<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">appeared, he rushed out, followed by Aragorn and the. others with flaming<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">brands. Caught between fire and water, and seeing an Elf-lord revealed in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his wrath, they were dismayed, and their horses were stricken with madness.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Three were carried away by the first assault of the flood; the others were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">now hurled into the water by their horses and overwhelmed.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'And is that the end of the Black Riders?' asked Frodo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'No,' said Gandalf. 'Their horses must have perished, and without them<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they are crippled. But the Ringwraiths themselves cannot be so easily<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">destroyed. However, there is nothing more to fear from them at present. Your<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">friends crossed after the flood had passed; and they found you lying on your<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">face at the top of the bank, with a broken sword under you. The horse was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">standing guard beside you. You were pale and cold, and they feared that you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were dead, or worse. Elrond's folk met them, carrying you slowly towards<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Ri vendell. '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Who made the flood?' asked Frodo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Elrond commanded it,' answered Gandalf. 'The river of this valley is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">under his power, and it will rise in anger when he has great need to bar the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Ford. As soon as the captain of the Ringwraiths rode into the water the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">flood was released. If I may say so, I added a few touches of my own: you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">may not have noticed, but some of the waves took the form of great white<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">horses with shining white riders; and there were many rolling and grinding<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">boulders. For a moment I was afraid that we had let loose too fierce a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wrath, and the flood would get out of hand and wash you all away. There is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">great vigour in the waters that come down from the snows of the Misty<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mountains.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Yes, it all comes back to me now,â€™ said Frodo: 'the tremendous<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">roaring. I thought I was drowning, with my friends and enemies and all. But<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">now we are safe!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gandalf looked quickly at Frodo, but he had shut his eyes. 'Yes, you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">are all safe for the present. Soon there will be feasting and merrymaking to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">celebrate the victory at the Ford of Bruinen, and you will all be there in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">places of honour.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Splendid!' said Frodo. 'It is wonderful that Elrond, and Glorfindel<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and such great lords, not to mention Strider, should take so much trouble<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and show me so much kindness.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well, there are many reasons why they should,â€™ said Gandalf, smiling.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I am one good reason. The Ring is another: you are the Ring-bearer. And you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">are the heir of Bilbo, the Ring-finder.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Dear Bilbo!â€™ said Frodo sleepily. 'I wonder where he is. I wish he was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">here and could hear all about it. It would have made him laugh, The cow<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">jumped over the Moon! And the poor old troll!â€™ With that he fell fast<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">asleep.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo was now safe in the Fast Homely House east of the Sea. That house<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was, as Bilbo had long ago reported, 'a perfect house, whether you like food<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">or sleep, or story-telling or singing, or just sitting and thinking best, or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a pleasant mixture of them all'. Merely to be there was a cure for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">weariness, fear, and sadness.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As the evening drew on, Frodo woke up again, and he found that he no<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">longer felt in need of rest or sleep, but had a mind for food and drink, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">probably for singing and story-telling afterwards. He got out of bed and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">discovered that his arm was already nearly as useful again as it ever had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">been. He found laid ready clean garments of green cloth that fitted him<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">excellently. Looking in a mirror he was startled to see a much thinner<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">reflection of himself than he remembered: it looked remarkably like the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">young nephew of Bilbo who used to go tramping with his uncle in the Shire;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">but the eyes looked out at him thoughtfully.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Yes, you have seen a thing or two since you last peeped out of a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">looking-glass,' he said to his reflection. 'But now for a merry meeting!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He stretched out his arms and whistled a tune.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At that moment there was a knock on the door, and Sam came in. He ran<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to Frodo and took his left hand, awkwardly and shyly. He stroked it gently<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and then he blushed and turned hastily away.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Hullo, Sam!â€™ said Frodo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'It's warm!' said Sam. 'Meaning your hand, Mr. Frodo. It has felt so<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">cold through the long nights. But glory and trumpets!â€™ he cried, turning<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">round again with shining eyes and dancing on the floor. â€™It's fine to see<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you up and yourself again, sir! Gandalf asked me to come and see if you were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ready to come down, and I thought he was joking.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I am ready,' said Frodo. 'Let's go and look for the rest of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">party!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I can take you to them, sir,' said Sam. 'It's a big house this, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">very peculiar. Always a bit more to discover, and no knowing what you'll<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">find round a corner. And Elves, sir! Elves here, and Elves there! Some like<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">kings, terrible and splendid; and some as merry as children. And the music<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and the singing-not that I have had the time or the heart for much listening<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">since we got here. But I'm getting to know some of the ways of the place.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I know what you have been doing, Sam,' said Frodo, taking his arm.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'But you shall be merry tonight, and listen to your heart's content. Come<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">on, guide me round the corners!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sam led him along several passages and down many steps and out into a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">high garden above the steep bank of the river. He found his friends sitting<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in a porch on the side of the house looking east. Shadows had fallen in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">valley below, but there was still a light on the faces of the mountains far<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">above. The air was warm. The sound of running and falling water was loud,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and the evening was filled with a faint scent of trees and flowers, as if<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">summer still lingered in Elrond's gardens.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Hurray!' cried Pippin, springing up. 'Here is our noble cousin! Make<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">way for Frodo, Lord of the Ring!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Hush!' said Gandalf from the shadows at the back of the porch. 'Evil<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">things do not come into this valley; but all the same we should not name<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">them. The Lord of the Ring is not Frodo, but the master of the Dark Tower of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mordor, whose power is again stretching out over the world! We are sitting<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in a fortress. Outside it is getting dark.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Gandalf has been saying many cheerful things like that,â€™ said Pippin.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'He thinks I need keeping in order. But it seems impossible, somehow, to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">feel gloomy or depressed in this place. I feel I could sing, if I knew the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">right song for the occasion.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I feel like singing myself,' laughed Frodo. 'Though at the moment I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">feel more like eating and drinking!â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'That will soon be cured,â€™ said Pippin. 'You have shown your usual<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">cunning in getting up just in time for a meal.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'More than meal! A feast!â€™ said Merry. 'As soon as Gandalf reported<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that you were recovered, the preparations began.â€™ He had hardly finished<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">speaking when they were summoned to the hall by the ringing of many bells.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The hall of Elrond's house was filled with folk: Elves for the most<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">part, though there were a few guests of other sorts. Elrond, as was his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">custom, sat in a great chair at the end of the long table upon the dais; and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">next to him on the one side sat Glorfindel, on the other side sat Gandalf.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo looked at them in wonder, for he had never before seen Elrond, of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">whom so many tales spoke; and as they sat upon his right hand and his left,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Glorfindel, and even Gandalf, whom he thought he knew so well, were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">revealed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">as lords of dignity and power. Gandalf was shorter in stature than the other<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">two; but his long white hair, his sweeping silver beard, and his broad<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shoulders, made him look like some wise king of ancient legend. In his aged<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">face under great snowy brows his dark eyes were set like coals that could<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">leap suddenly into fire.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Glorfindel was tall and straight; his hair was of shining gold, his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">face fair and young and fearless and full of joy; his eyes were bright and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">keen, and his voice like music; on his brow sat wisdom, and in his hand was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">strength.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The face of Elrond was ageless, neither old nor young, though in it was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">written the memory of many things both glad and sorrowful. His hair was dark<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">as the shadows of twilight, and upon it was set a circlet of silver; his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">eyes were grey as a clear evening, and in them was a light like the light of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stars. Venerable he seemed as a king crowned with many winters, and yet hale<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">as a tried warrior in the fulness of his strength. He was the Lord of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Rivendell and mighty among both Elves and Men.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the middle of the table, against the woven cloths upon the wall,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">there was a chair under a canopy, and there sat a lady fair to look upon,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and so like was she in form of womanhood to Elrond that Frodo guessed that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">she was one of his close kindred. Young she was and yet not so. The braids<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of her dark hair were touched by no frost, her white arms and clear face<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were flawless and smooth, and the light of stars was in her bright eyes,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">grey as a cloudless night; yet queenly she looked, and thought and knowledge<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were in her glance, as of one who has known many things that the years<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">bring. Above her brow her head was covered with a cap of silver lace netted<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with small gems, glittering white; but her soft grey raiment had no ornament<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">save a girdle of leaves wrought in silver.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">So it was that Frodo saw her whom few mortals had yet seen; Arwen,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">daughter of Elrond, in whom it was said that the likeness of LÂ®thien had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">come on earth again; and she was called Undumiel, for she was the Evenstar<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of her people. Long she had been in the land of her mother's kin, in Lurien<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">beyond the mountains, and was but lately returned to Rivendell to her<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">father's house. But her brothers, Elladan and Elrohir, were out upon<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">errantry: for they rode often far afield with the Rangers of the North,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">forgetting never their mother's torment in the dens of the ores.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Such loveliness in living thing Frodo had never seen before nor<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">imagined in his mind; and he was both surprised and abashed to find that he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">had a seat at Elrond' s table among all these folk so high and fair. Though<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he had a suitable chair, and was raised upon several cushions, he felt very<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">small, and rather out of place; but that feeling quickly passed. The feast<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was merry and the food all that his hunger could desire. It was some time<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">before he looked about him again or even turned to his neighbours.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He looked first for his friends. Sam had begged to be allowed to wait<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">on his master, but had been told that for this time he was a guest of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">honour. Frodo could see him now, sitting with Pippin and Merry at the upper<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">end of one of the side-tables close to the dais. He could see no sign of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Strider.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Next to Frodo on his right sat a dwarf of important appearance, richly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dressed. His beard, very long and forked, was white, nearly as white as the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">snow-white cloth of his garments. He wore a silver belt, and round his neck<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hung a chain of silver and diamonds. Frodo stopped eating to look at him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Welcome and well met!' said the dwarf, turning towards him. Then he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">actually rose from his seat and bowed. 'Gluin at your service,' he said, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">bowed still lower.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Frodo Baggins at your service and your family's,' said Frodo<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">correctly, rising in surprise and scattering his cushions. 'Am I right in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">guessing that you are the Gluin, one of the twelve companions of the great<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Thorin Oaken shield?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Quite right,' answered the dwarf, gathering up the cushions and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">courteously assisting Frodo back into his seat. 'And I do not ask, for I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">have already been told that you are the kinsman and adopted heir of our<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">friend Bilbo the renowned. Allow me to congratulate you on your recovery.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Thank you very much,â€™ said Frodo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You have had some very strange adventures, I hear,' said Gluin. 'I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wonder greatly what brings four hobbits on so long a journey. Nothing like<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it has happened since Bilbo came with us. But perhaps I should not inquire<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">too closely, since Elrond and Gandalf do not seem disposed to talk of this?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I think we will not speak of it, at least not yet,' said Frodo<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">politely.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He guessed that even in Elrond's house the matter of the Ring was not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">one for casual talk; and in any case he wished to forget his troubles for a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">time. 'But I am equally curious,' he added, 'to learn what brings so<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">important a dwarf so far from the Lonely Mountain.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gluin looked at him. 'If you have not heard, I think we will not speak<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">yet of that either. Master Elrond will summon us all ere long, I believe,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and then we shall all hear many things. But there is much else that may be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">told.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Throughout the rest of the meal they talked together, but Frodo<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">listened more than he spoke; for the news of the Shire, apart from the Ring,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">seemed small and far-away and unimportant, while Gluin had much to tell of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">events in the northern regions of Wilderland. Frodo learned that Grimbeorn<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Old, son of Beorn, was now the lord of many sturdy men, and to their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">land between the Mountains and Mirkwood neither ore nor wolf dared to go.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Indeed,' said Gluin, 'if it were not for the Beornings, the passage<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">from Dale to Rivendell would long ago have become impossible. They are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">valiant men and keep open the High Pass and the Ford of Carrock. But their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">tolls are high,' he added with a shake of his head; 'and like Beorn of old<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they are not over fond of dwarves. Still, they are trusty, and that is much<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in these days. Nowhere are there any men so friendly to us as the Men of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Dale. They are good folk, the Bardings. The grandson of Bard the Bowman<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">rules them, Brand son of Bain son of Bard. He is a strong king, and his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">realm now reaches far south and east of Esgaroth.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'And what of your own people?' asked Frodo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'There is much to tell, good and bad,' said Gluin; 'yet it is mostly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">good: we have so far been fortunate, though we do not escape the shadow of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">these times. If you really wish to hear of us, I will tell you tidings<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">gladly. But stop me when you are weary! Dwarves' tongues run on when<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">speaking of their handiwork, they say.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And with that Gluin embarked on a long account of the doings of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Dwarf-kingdom. He was delighted to have found so polite a listener; for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo showed no sign of weariness and made no attempt to change the subject,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">though actually he soon got rather lost among the strange names of people<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and places that he had never heard of before. He was interested, however, to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hear that Dbin was still King under the Mountain, and was now old (having<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">passed his two hundred and fiftieth year), venerable, and fabulously rich.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Of the ten companions who had survived the Battle of Five Armies seven were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">still with him: Dwalin, Gluin, Dori, Nori, Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur. Bombur<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was now so fat that he could not move himself from his couch to his chair at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">table, and it took six young dwarves to lift him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'And what has become of Balin and Ori and Uin?' asked Frodo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A shadow passed over Gluin's face. 'We do not know,' he answered. 'It<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">is largely on account of Balin that I have come to ask the advice of those<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that dwell in Rivendell. But tonight let us speak of merrier things!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gluin began then to talk of the works of his people, telling Frodo<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">about their great labours in Dale and under the Mountain. 'We have done<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">well,' he said. 'But in metalwork we cannot rival our fathers, many of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">whose, secrets are lost. We make good armour and keen swords, but we cannot<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">again make mail or blade to match those that were made before the dragon<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">came. Only in mining and building have we surpassed the old days. You should<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">see the waterways of Dale, Frodo, and the fountains, and the pools! You<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">should see the stone-paved roads of many colours! And the halls and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">cavernous streets under the earth with arches carved like trees; and the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">terraces and towers upon the Mountainâ€™s sides! Then you would see that we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">have not been idle.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I will come and see them, if ever I can,' said Frodo. 'How surprised<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bilbo would have been to see all the changes in the Desolation of Smaug!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gluin looked at Frodo and smiled. 'You were very fond of Bilbo were you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">not?' he asked.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Yes,' answered Frodo. 1 would rather see him than all the towers and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">palaces in the world.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At length the feast came to an end. Elrond and Arwen rose and went down<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the hall, and the company followed them in due order. The doors were thrown<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">open, and they went across a wide passage and through other doors, and came<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">into a further hall. In it were no tables, but a bright fire was burning in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a great hearth between the carven pillars upon either side.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo found himself walking with Gandalf. 'This is the Hall of Fire'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">said the wizard. 'Here you will hear many songs and tales-if you can keep<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">awake. But except on high days it usually stands empty and quiet, and people<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">come here who wish for peace, and thought. There is always a fire here, all<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the year round, but there is little other light.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As Elrond entered and went towards the seat prepared for him, elvish<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">minstrels began to make sweet music. Slowly the hall filled, and Frodo<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">looked with delight upon the many fair faces that were gathered together;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the golden firelight played upon them and shimmered in their hair. Suddenly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he noticed, not far from the further end of the fire, a small dark figure<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">seated on a stool with his back propped against a pillar. Beside him on the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ground was a drinking-cup and some bread. Frodo wondered whether he was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ill<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">(if people were ever ill in Ri vendell), and had been unable to come to the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">feast. His head seemed sunk in sleep on his breast, and a fold of his dark<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">cloak was drawn over his face.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Elrond went forward and stood beside the silent figure. 'Awake little<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">master, he said, with a smile. Then, turning to Frodo, he beckoned to him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Now at last the hour has come that you have wished for, Frodo,' he said.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Here is a friend that you have long missed.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The dark figure raised its head and uncovered its face.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Bilbo!' cried Frodo with sudden recognition, and he sprang forward.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Hullo, Frodo my lad!â€™ said Bilbo. 'So you have got here at last. I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hoped you would manage it. Well, well! So all this feasting is in your<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">honour, I hear. I hope you enjoyed yourself?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Why weren't you there?' cried Frodo. 'And why haven't I been allowed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to see you before?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Because you were asleep. I have seen a good deal of you. I have sat by<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">your side with Sam each day. But as for the feast' I don't go in for such<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">things much now. And I had something else to do.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'What were you doing?â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Why, sitting and thinking. I do a lot of that nowadays, and this is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the best place to do it in, as a rule. Wake up, indeed!â€™ he said, cocking an<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">eye at Elrond. There was a bright twinkle in it and no sign of sleepiness<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that Frodo could see. 'Wake up! I was not asleep. Master Elrond. If you want<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to know, you have all come out from your feast too soon, and you have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">disturbed me-in the middle of making up a song. I was stuck over a line or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">two, and was thinking about them; but now I don't suppose I shall ever get<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">them right. There will be such a deal of singing that the ideas will be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">driven clean out of my head. I shall have to get my friend the DÂ®nadan to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">help me. Where is he?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Elrond laughed. 'He shall be found,' he said. 'Then you two shall go<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">into a corner and finish your task, and we will hear it and judge it before<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">we end our merrymaking.' Messengers were sent to find Bilbo's friend, though<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">none knew where he was, or why he had not been present at the feast.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the meanwhile Frodo and Bilbo sat side by side, and Sam came quickly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and placed himself near them. They talked together in soft voices, oblivious<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of the mirth and music in the hall about them. Bilbo had not much to say of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">himself. When he had left Hobbiton he had wandered off aimlessly, along the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Road or in the country on either side; but somehow he had steered all the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">time towards Ri vendell. 'I got here without much adventure,' he said, 'and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">after a rest I went on with the dwarves to Dale: my last journey. I shan't<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">travel again. Old Balin had gone away. Then I came back here, and here I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">have been. I have done this and that. I have written some more of my book.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And, of course, I make up a few songs. They sing them occasionally: just to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">please me, I think; for, of course, they aren't really good enough for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Rivendell. And I listen and I think. Time doesn't seem to pass here: it just<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">is. A remarkable place altogether.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I hear all kinds of news, from over the Mountains, and out of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">South, but hardly anything from the Shire. I heard about the Ring, of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">course. Gandalf has been here often. Not that he has told me a great deal,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he has become closer than ever these last few years. The DÂ®nadan has told me<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">more. Fancy that ring of mine causing such a disturbance! It is a pity that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gandalf did not find out more sooner. I could have brought the thing here<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">myself long ago without so much trouble. I have thought several times of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">going back to Hobbiton for it; but I am getting old, and they would not let<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">me: Gandalf and Elrond, I mean. They seemed to think that the Enemy was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">looking high and low for me, and would make mincemeat of me, if he caught<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">me<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">tottering about in the Wild.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'And Gandalf said: "The Ring has passed on, Bilbo. It would do no good<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to you or to others, if you tried to meddle with it again." Odd sort of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">remark, just like Gandalf. But he said he was looking after you, so I let<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">things be. I am frightfully glad to see you safe and sound.' He paused and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">looked at Frodo doubtfully.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Have you got it here?' he asked in a whisper. I can't help feeling<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">curious, you know, after all I've heard. I should very much like just to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">peep at it again.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Yes, I've got it,' answered Frodo, feeling a strange reluctance. 'It<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">looks just the same as ever it did.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well, I should just like to see it for a moment,' said Bilbo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">When he had dressed, Frodo found that while he slept the Ring had been<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hung about his neck on a new chain, light but strong. Slowly he drew it out.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bilbo put out his hand. But Frodo quickly drew back the Ring. To his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">distress and amazement he found that he was no longer looking at Bilbo; a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shadow seemed to have fallen between them, and through it he found himself<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">eyeing a little wrinkled creature with a hungry face and bony groping hands.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He felt a desire to strike him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The music and singing round them seemed to falter and a silence fell.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bilbo looked quickly at Frodo's face and passed his hand across his eyes. 'I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">understand now,' he said. 'Put it away! I am sorry: sorry you have come in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">for this burden: sorry about everything. Don't adventures ever have an end?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I suppose not. Someone else always has to carry on the story. Well, it can't<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">be helped. I wonder if it's any good trying to finish my book? But don't<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">let's worry about it now-let's have some real News! Tell me all about the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Shire!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo hid the Ring away, and the shadow passed leaving hardly a shred<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of memory. The light and music of Rivendell was about him again. Bilbo<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">smiled and laughed happily. Every item of news from the Shire that Frodo<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">could tell-aided and corrected now and again by Sam-was of the greatest<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">interest to him, from the felling of the least tree to the pranks of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">smallest child in Hobbiton. They were so deep in the doings of the Four<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Farthings that they did not notice the arrival of a man clad in dark green<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">cloth. For many minutes he stood looking down at them with a smile.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Suddenly Bilbo looked up. 'Ah, there you are at last, DÂ®nadan!â€™ he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">cried.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Strider!' said Frodo. 'You seem to have a lot of names.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well, Strider is one that I haven't heard before, anyway,' said Bilbo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'What do you call him that for?â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'They call me that in Bree,â€™ said Strider laughing, 'and that is how I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was introduced to him.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'And why do you call him DÂ®nadan?â€™ asked Frodo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">' The DÂ®nadan,' said Bilbo. 'Fie is often called that here. But I thought<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you knew enough Elvish at least to know dÂ®n-udan: Man of the West,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">NÂ®menorean. But this is not the time for lessons!â€™ He turned to Strider.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Where have you been, my friend? Why weren't you at the feast? The Fady<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Arwen was there.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Strider looked down at Bilbo gravely. 'I know,' he said. 'But often I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">must put mirth aside. Elladan and Elrohir have returned out of the Wild<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">unlooked-for, and they had tidings that I wished to hear at once.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well, my dear fellow,' said Bilbo, 'now you've heard the news, can't<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you spare me a moment? I want your help in something urgent. Elrond says<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">this song of mine is to be finished before the end of the evening, and I am<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stuck. Fet's go off into a corner and polish it up!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Strider smiled. 'Come then!' he said. 'Fet me hear it!â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo was left to himself for a while, for Sam had fallen asleep. He<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was alone and felt rather forlorn' although all about him the folk of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Rivendell were gathered. But those near him were silent, intent upon the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">music of the voices and the instruments, and they gave no heed to anything<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">else. Frodo began to listen.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At first the beauty of the melodies and of the interwoven words in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">elven-tongues, even though he understood them little' held him in a spell,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">as soon as he began to attend to them. Almost it seemed that the words took<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shape, and visions of far lands and bright things that he had never yet<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">imagined opened out before him; and the firelit hall became like a golden<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mist above seas of foam that sighed upon the margins of the world. Then the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">enchantment became more and more dreamlike, until he felt that an endless<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">river of swelling gold and silver was flowing over him, too multitudinous<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">for its pattern to be comprehended; it became part of the throbbing air<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">about him, and it drenched and drowned him. Swiftly he sank under its<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shining weight into a deep realm of sleep.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There he wandered long in a dream of music that turned into running<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">water, and then suddenly into a voice. It seemed to be the voice of Bilbo<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">chanting verses. Faint at first and then clearer ran the words.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Edrendil was a mariner<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that tarried in Arvernien;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of silver were her lanterns made,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">her prow was fashioned like a swan,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and light upon her banners laid.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In panoply of ancient kings,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of silver was his habergeon,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his scabbard of chalcedony;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his sword of steel was valiant,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of adamant his helmet tall,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">an eagle-plume upon his crest,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">upon his breast an emerald.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Beneath the Moon and under star<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he wandered far from northern strands,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">bewildered on enchanted ways<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">beyond the days of mortal lands.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">where shadow lies on frozen hills,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">from nether heats and burning waste<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he turned in haste, and roving still<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">on starless waters far astray<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">at last he came to Night of Naught,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of shining shore nor light he sought.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The winds of wrath came driving him,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and blindly in the foam he fled<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">from west to east and errandless,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">unheralded he homeward sped.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There flying Elwing came to him,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and dauntless then with burning brow<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he turned his prow; and in the night<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">as might of death across the grey<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and long-forsaken seas distressed:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">from east to west he passed away.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Through Evernight he back was borne<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">o'er leagues unlit and foundered shores<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A wanderer escaped from night<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to haven white he came at last,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">where keen the air, where pale as glass<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and sages old him marvels told,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and harps of gold they brought to him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They clothed him then in elven-white,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">as through the Calacirian<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and laid on him undying doom,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his home through shadows journeying,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and burning as an island star<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">on high above the mists he came,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a distant flame before the Sun,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a wonder ere the waking dawn<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And over Middle-earth he passed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and heard at last the weeping sore<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of women and of elven-maids<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in Elder Days, in years of yore,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">on Hither Shores where mortals are;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">for ever still a herald on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">an errand that should never rest<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The chanting ceased. Frodo opened his eyes and saw that Bilbo was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">seated on his stool in a circle of listeners, who were smiling and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">applauding.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Now we had better have it again,' said an Elf.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bilbo got up and bowed. 'I am flattered, Lindir,â€™ he said. 'But it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">would be too tiring to repeat it all.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Not too tiring for you,' the Elves answered laughing. 'You know you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">are never tired of reciting your own verses. But really we cannot answer<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">your question at one hearing!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'What!' cried Bilbo. 'You can't tell which parts were mine, and which<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were the DÂ®nadan's?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'It is not easy for us to tell the difference between two mortals' said<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Elf.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Nonsense, Lindir,' snorted Bilbo. 'If you can't distinguish between a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Man and a Hobbit, your judgement is poorer than I imagined. They're as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">different as peas and apples.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Maybe. To sheep other sheep no doubt appear different,' laughed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Lindir. 'Or to shepherds. But Mortals have not been our study. We have other<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">business.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I won't argue with you,' said Bilbo. 'I am sleepy after so much music<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and singing. I'll leave you to guess, if you want to.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He got up and came towards Frodo. 'Well, that's over,' he said in a low<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">voice. 'It went off better than I expected. I don't often get asked for a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">second hearing. What did you think of it?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I am not going to try and guess,' said Frodo smiling.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You needn't,â€™ said Bilbo. 'As a matter of fact it was all mine. Except<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that Aragorn insisted on my putting in a green stone. He seemed to think it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">important. I don't know why. Otherwise he obviously thought the whole thing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">rather above my head, and he said that if I had the cheek to make verses<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">about Edrendil in the house of Elrond, it was my affair. I suppose he was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I don't know,' said Frodo. 'It seemed to me to fit somehow, though I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">can't explain. I was half asleep when you began, and it seemed to follow on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">from something that I was dreaming about. I didn't understand that it was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">really you speaking until near the end.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'It is difficult to keep awake here, until you get used to it;' said<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bilbo. 'Not that hobbits would ever acquire quite the elvish appetite for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">music and poetry and tales. They seem to like them as much as food, or more.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They will be going on for a long time yet. What do you say to slipping off<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">for some more quiet talk?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Can we?â€™ said Frodo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Of course. This is merrymaking not business. Come and go as you like,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">as long as you don't make a noise.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They got up and withdrew quietly into the shadows, and made for the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">doors. Sam they left behind, fast asleep still with a smile on his face. In<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">spite of his delight in Bilbo's company Frodo felt a tug of regret as they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">passed out of the Hall of Fire. Even as they stepped over the threshold a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">single clear voice rose in song.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo halted for a moment, looking back. Elrond was in his chair and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the fire was on his face like summer -light upon the trees. Near him sat the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Lady Arwen. To his surprise Frodo saw that Aragorn stood beside her; his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dark cloak was thrown back, and he seemed to be clad in elven-mail, and a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">star shone on his breast. They spoke together, and then suddenly it seemed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to Frodo that Arwen turned towards him, and the light of her eyes fell on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">him from afar and pierced his heart.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He stood still enchanted, while the sweet syllables of the elvish song<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fell like clear jewels of blended word and melody. ' It is a song to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Elbereth,' said Bilbo. 'They will sing that, and other songs of the Blessed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Realm, many times tonight. Come on!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He led Frodo back to his own little room. It opened on to the gar dens<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and looked south across the ravine of the Bruinen. There they sat for some<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">while, looking through the window at the bright stars above the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">steep-climbing woods, and talking softly. They spoke no more of the small<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">news of the Shire far away, nor of the dark shadows and perils that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">encompassed them, but of the fair things they had seen in the world<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">together, of the Elves, of the stars, of trees, and the gentle fall of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">bright year in the woods.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At last there came a knock on the door. 'Begging your pardon,â€™ said<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sam, putting in his head, 'but I was just wondering if you would be wanting<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">anything.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'And begging yours, Sam Gamgee,' replied Bilbo. 'I guess you mean that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it is time your master went to bed.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well, sir, there is a Council early tomorrow, I hear and he only got<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">up today for the first time.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Quite right, Sam,' laughed Bilbo. 'You can trot off and tell Gandalf<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that he has gone to bed. Good night, Frodo! Bless me, but it has been good<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to see you again! There are no folk like hobbits after all for a real good<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">talk. I am getting very old, and I began to wonder if I should ever live to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">see your chapters of our story. Good night! I'll take a walk, I think, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">look at the stars of Elbereth in the garden. Sleep well!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Next day Frodo woke early, feeling refreshed and well. He walked along<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the terraces above the loud-flowing Bruinen and watched the pale, cool sun<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">rise above the far mountains, and shine down. Slanting through the thin<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">silver mist; the dew upon the yellow leaves was glimmering, and the woven<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">nets of gossamer twinkled on every bush. Sam walked beside him, saying<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">nothing, but sniffing the air, and looking every now and again with wonder<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in his eyes at the great heights in the East. The snow was white upon their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">peaks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">On a seat cut in the stone beside a turn in the path they came upon<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gandalf and Bilbo deep in talk. 'Hullo! Good morning!' said Bilbo. 'Feel<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ready for the great council?â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I feel ready for anything,' answered Frodo. 'But most of all I should<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">like to go walking today and explore the valley. I should like to get into<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">those pine- woods up there.' He pointed away far up the side of Rivendell to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the north.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You may have a chance later,' said Gandalf. 'But we cannot make any<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">plans yet. There is much to hear and decide today.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Suddenly as they were talking a single clear bell rang out. 'That is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the warning bell for the Council of Elrond,' cried Gandalf. 'Come along now!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Both you and Bilbo are wanted.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo and Bilbo followed the wizard quickly along the winding path back<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to the house; behind them, uninvited and for the moment forgotten, trotted<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sam.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gandalf led them to the porch where Frodo had found his friends the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">evening before. The light of the clear autumn morning was now glowing in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">valley. The noise of bubbling waters came up from the foaming river-bed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Birds were singing, and a wholesome peace lay on the land. To Frodo his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dangerous flight, and the rumours of the darkness growing in the world<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">outside, already seemed only the memories of a troubled dream; but the faces<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that were turned to meet them as they entered were grave.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Elrond was there, and several others were seated in silence about him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo saw Glorfindel and Gluin; and in a corner alone Strider was sitting,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">clad in his old travel-worn clothes again. Elrond drew Frodo to a seat by<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his side, and presented him to the company, saying:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Here, my friends is the hobbit, Frodo son of Drogo. Few have ever come<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hither through greater peril or on an errand more urgent.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He then pointed out and named those whom Frodo had not met before.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There was a younger dwarf at Gluin's side: his son Gimli. Beside Glorfindel<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">there were several other counsellors of Elrond's household, of whom Erestor<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was the chief; and with him was Galdor, an Elf from the Grey Havens who had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">come on an errand from Cnrdan the Shipwright. There was also a strange Elf<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">clad in green and brown, Legolas, a messenger from his father, Thranduil,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the King of the Elves of Northern Mirkwood. And seated a little apart was a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">tall man with a fair and noble face, dark-haired and grey-eyed, proud and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stern of glance.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He was cloaked and booted as if for a journey on horseback; and indeed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">though his garments were rich, and his cloak was lined with fur, they were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stained with long travel. He had a collar of silver in which a single white<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stone was set; his locks were shorn about his shoulders. On a baldric he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wore a great horn tipped with silver that now was laid upon his knees. He<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">gazed at Frodo and Bilbo with sudden wonder.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Here,' said Elrond, turning to Gandalf, 'is Boromir, a man from the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">South. He arrived in the grey morning, and seeks for counsel. I have bidden<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">him to be present, for here his questions will be answered.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Not all that was spoken and debated in the Council need now be told.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Much was said of events in the world outside, especially in the South, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in the wide lands east of the Mountains. Of these things Frodo had already<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">heard many rumours; but the tale of Gluin was new to him, and when the dwarf<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">spoke he listened attentively. It appeared that amid the splendour of their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">works of hand the hearts of the Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">troubled.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'It is now many years ago,' said Gluin, 'that a shadow of disquiet fell<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">upon our people. Whence it came we did not at first perceive. Words began to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">be whispered in secret-: it was said that we were hemmed in a narrow place,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and that greater wealth and splendour would be found in a wider world. Some<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">spoke of Moria: the mighty works of our fathers that are called in our own<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">tongue Khazad-dym; and they declared that now at last we had the power and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">numbers to return.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gluin sighed. 'Moria! Moria! Wonder of the Northern world! Too deep we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">delved there, and woke the nameless fear. Long have its vast mansions lain<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">empty since the children of Durin fled. But now we spoke of it again with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">longing, and yet with dread; for no dwarf has dared to pass the doors of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Khazad-dym for many lives of kings, save Thrur only, and he perished. At<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">last, however, Balin listened to the whispers, and resolved to go; and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">though Dbin did not give leave willingly, he took with him Ori and Uin and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">many of our folk, and they went away south.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">"That was nigh on thirty years ago. For a while we had news and it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">seemed good: messages reported that Moria had been entered and a great work<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">begun there. Then there was silence, and no word has ever come from Moria<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">since.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">"Then about a year ago a messenger came to Dbin, but not from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Moria -from Mordor: a horseman in the night, who called Dbin to his gate. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Lord Sauron the Great, so he said, wished for our friendship. Rings he would<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">give for it, such as he gave of old. And he asked urgently concerning<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hobbits, of what kind they were, and where they dwelt. "For Sauron knows,"<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">said he, "that one of these was known to you on a time."<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">yet evil to behold, and they received his aid and grew mighty in craft,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">whereas he learned all their secrets, and betrayed them, and forged secretly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in the Mountain of Fire the One Ring to be their master. But Celebrimbor was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">aware of him, and hid the Three which he had made; and there was war, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the land was laid waste, and the gate of Moria was shut.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Then through all the years that followed he traced the Ring; but since<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that history is elsewhere recounted, even as Elrond himself set it down in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his books of lore, it is not here recalled. For it is a long tale, full of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">deeds great and terrible, and briefly though Elrond spoke, the sun rode up<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the sky, and the morning was passing ere he ceased.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Of NÂ®menor he spoke, its glory and its fall, and the return of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Kings of Men to Middle-earth out of the deeps of the Sea, borne upon the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wings of storm. Then Elendil the Tall and his mighty sons, Isildur and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Anbrion, became great lords; and the North-realm they made in Arnor, and the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">South-realm in Gondor above the mouths of Anduin. But Sauron of Mordor<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">assailed them, and they made the Last Alliance of Elves and Men, and the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hosts of Gil-galad and Elendil were mustered in Arnor.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Thereupon Elrond paused a while and sighed. 'I remember well the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were assembled. And yet not so many, nor so fair, as when Thangorodrim was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">broken, and the Elves deemed that evil was ended for ever, and it was not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You remember?â€™ said Frodo, speaking his thought aloud in his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">astonishment. 'But I thought,' he stammered as Elrond turned towards him, 'I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">thought that the fall of Gil-galad was a long age ago.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'So it was indeed,' answered Elrond gravely. 'But my memory reaches<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">back even to the Elder Days. Edrendil was my sire, who was born in Gondolin<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">before its fall; and my mother was Elwing, daughter of Dior, son of LÂ®thien<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of Doriath. I have seen three ages in the West of the world, and many<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">defeats, and many fruitless victories.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I was the herald of Gil-galad and marched with his host. I was at the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mastery: for the Spear of Gil-galad and the Sword of Elendil, Aiglos and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Narsil, none could withstand. I beheld the last combat on the slopes of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Orodruin, where Gil-galad died, and Elendil fell, and Narsil broke beneath<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At this the stranger, Boromir, broke in. 'So that is what became of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Ring!' he cried. 'If ever such a tale was told in the South, it has long<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">soon he was betrayed by it to his death; and so it is named in the North<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">not stay. You know little of the lands beyond your bounds. Peace and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">freedom, do you say? The North would have known them little but for us. Fear<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">would have destroyed them. But when dark things come from the houseless<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'And yet less thanks have we than you. Travellers scowl at us, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">countrymen give us scornful names. "Strider" I am to one fat man who lives<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'That shall be told,' said Elrond.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'But not yet, I beg, Master!â€™ said Bilbo. 'Already the Sun is climbing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to noon, and I feel the need of something to strengthen me.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I had not named you,â€™ said Elrond smiling. 'But I do so now. Come!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Tell us your tale. And if you have not yet cast your story into verse, you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Very well,' said Bilbo. 'I will do as you bid. But I will now tell the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">true story, and if some here have heard me tell it otherwise' â€” he looked<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to claim the treasure as my very own in those days, and to be rid of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">name of thief that was put on me. But perhaps I understand things a little<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">better now. Anyway, this is what happened.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">To some there Bilbo's tale was wholly new, and they listened with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">amazement while the old hobbit, actually not at all displeased, recounted<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his adventure with Gollum, at full length. He did not omit a single riddle.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He would have given also an account of his party and disappearance from the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Shire, if he had been allowed; but Elrond raised his hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well told, my friend,' he said, 'but that is enough at this time. For<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the moment it suffices to know that the Ring passed to Frodo, your heir. Let<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">him now speak!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Then, less willingly than Bilbo, Frodo told of all his dealings with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Ring from the day that it passed into his keeping. Every step of his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">journey from Hobbiton to the Ford of Bruinen was questioned and considered,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and everything that he could recall concerning the Black Riders was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">examined. At last he sat down again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Not bad,' Bilbo said to him. 'You would have made a good story of it,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">if they hadn't kept on interrupting. I tried to make a few notes, but we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shall have to go over it all again together some time, if I am to write it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">up. There are whole chapters of stuff before you ever got here!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Yes, it made quite a long tale,' answered Frodo. 'But the story still<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">does not seem complete to me. I still want to know a good deal, especially<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">about Gandalf.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Galdor of the Havens, who sat near by, overheard him. 'You speak for me<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">also,â€™ he cried, and turning to Elrond he said: 'The Wise may have good<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">reason to believe that the halfling's trove is indeed the Great Ring of long<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hear the proofs? And I would ask this also. What of Saruman? He is learned<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in the lore of the Rings, yet he is not among us. What is his counsel-if he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">knows the things that we have heard?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'The questions that you ask, Galdor, are bound together,' said Elrond.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I had not overlooked them, and they shall be answered. But these things it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">is the part of Gandalf to make clear; and I call upon him last, for it is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the place of honour, and in all this matter he has been the chief.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Some, Galdor,' said Gandalf, 'would think the tidings of Gluin, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the pursuit of Frodo, proof enough that the halfling's trove is a thing of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">great worth to the Enemy. Yet it is a ring. What then? The Nine the Nazgyl<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">keep. The Seven are taken or destroyed.' At this Gluin stirred, but did not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">speak. 'The Three we know of. What then is this one that he desires so much?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'There is indeed a wide waste of time between the River and the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mountain, between the loss and the finding. But the gap in the knowledge of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Wise has been filled at last. Yet too slowly. For the Enemy has been<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">close behind, closer even than I feared. And well is it that not until this<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">year, this very summer, as it seems, did he learn the full truth.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Some here will remember that many years ago I myself dared to pass the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">doors of the Necromancer in Dol Guldur, and secretly explored his ways, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">found thus that our fears were true: he was none other than Sauron, our<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Enemy of old, at length taking shape and power again. Some, too, will<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">remember also that Saruman dissuaded us from open deeds against him, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">long we watched him only. Yet at last, as his shadow grew, Saruman yielded,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and the Council put forth its strength and drove the evil out of Mirkwood<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and that was in the very year of the finding of this Ring: a strange chance,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">if chance it was.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'But we were too late, as Elrond foresaw. Sauron also had watched us,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and had long prepared against our stroke, governing Mordor from afar through<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Minas Morgul, where his Nine servants dwelt, until all was ready. Then he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">gave way before us, but only feigned to flee, and soon after came to the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Dark Tower and openly declared himself. Then for the last time the Council<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">met; for now we learned that he was seeking ever more eagerly for the One.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">We feared then that he had some news of it that we knew nothing of. But<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Saruman said nay, and repeated what he had said to us before: that the One<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">would never again be found in Middle-earth.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">"At the worst," said he, "our Enemy knows that we have it not and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that it still is lost. But what was lost may yet be found, he thinks. Fear<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">not! His hope will cheat him. Have I not earnestly studied this matter? Into<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">down the River to the Sea. There let it lie until the End.'"<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gandalf fell silent, gazing eastward from the porch to the far peaks of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Misty Mountains, at whose great roots the peril of the world had so long<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">lain hidden. He sighed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'There I was at fault,' he said. 'I was lulled by the words of Saruman<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Wise; but I should have sought for the truth sooner, and our peril would<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">now be less.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'We were all at fault,â€™ said Elrond, 'and but for your vigilance the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Darkness, maybe, would already be upon us. But say on!â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'From the first my heart misgave me, against all reason that I knew,'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">said Gandalf, 'and I desired to know how this thing came to Gollum, and how<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">long he had possessed it. So I set a watch for him, guessing that he would<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ere long come forth from his darkness to seek for his treasure. He came, but<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he escaped and was not found. And then alas ! I let the matter rest, watching<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and waiting only, as we have too often done.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Time passed with many cares, until my doubts were awakened again to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sudden fear. Whence came the hobbit's ring? What, if my fear was true,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">should be done with it? Those things I must decide. But I spoke yet of my<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dread to none, knowing the peril of an untimely whisper, if it went astray.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In all the long wars with the Dark Tower treason has ever been our greatest<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">foe.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'That was seventeen years ago. Soon I became aware that spies of many<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sorts, even beasts and birds, were gathered round the Shire, and my fear<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">grew. I called for the help of the DÂ®nedain, and their watch was doubled;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and I opened my heart to Aragorn, the heir of Isildur.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'And I,' said Aragorn, 'counselled that we should hunt for Gollum. too<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">late though it may seem. And since it seemed fit that Isildur's heir should<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">labour to repair Isildur's fault, I went with Gandalf on the long and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hopeless search.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Then Gandalf told how they had explored the whole length of Wilderland,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">down even to the Mountains of Shadow and the fences of Mordor. 'There we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">rumour of him, and we guess that he dwelt there long in the dark hills; but<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">we never found him, and at last I despaired. And then in my despair I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">thought again of a test that might make the finding of Gollum unneeded. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ring itself might tell if it were the One. The memory of words at the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Council came back to me: words of Saruman, half-heeded at the time. I heard<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">them now clearly in my heart.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">' "The Nine, the Seven, and the Three," he said, "had each their proper<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">gem. Not so the One. It was round and unadorned, as it were one of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">lesser rings; but its maker set marks upon it that the skilled, maybe, could<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">still see and read."<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'What those marks were he had not said. Who now would know? The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">maker.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And Saruman? But great though his lore may be, it must have a source. What<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hand save Sauronâ€™s ever held this thing, ere it was lost? The hand of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Isildur alone.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'With that thought, I forsook the chase, and passed swiftly to Gondor.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In former days the members of my order had been well received there, but<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Saruman most of all. Often he had been for long the guest of the Lords of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the City. Less welcome did the Lord Denethor show me then than of old, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">grudgingly he permitted me to search among his hoarded scrolls and books.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™ "If indeed you look only, as you say, for records of ancient days,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and the beginnings of the City, read on! " he said. "For to me what was is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">less dark than what is to come, and that is my care. But unless you have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">more skill even than Saruman, who has studied here long, you will find<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">naught that is not well known to me, who am master of the lore of this<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">City."<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'So said Denethor. And yet there lie in his hoards many records that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">few now can read, even of the lore-masters, for their scripts and tongues<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">have become dark to later men. And Boromir, there lies in Minas Tirith<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">still, unread, I guess, by any save Saruman and myself since the kings<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">failed, a scroll that Isildur made himself. For Isildur did not march away<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">straight from the war in Mordor, as some have told the tale.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Some in the North, maybe,' Boromir broke in. 'All know in Gondor that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he went first to Minas Anor and dwelt a while with his nephew Meneldil,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">instructing him, before he committed to him the rule of the South Kingdom.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In that time he planted there the last sapling of the White Tree in memory<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of his brother.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'But in that time also he made this scroll,' said Gandalf; 'and that is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">not remembered in Gondor, it would seem. For this scroll concerns the Ring,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and thus wrote Isildur therein:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Great Ring shall go now to be an heirloom of the North Kingdom; but<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">records of it shall be left in Gondor, where also dwell the heirs of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Elendil, lest a time come when the memory of these great matters shall grow<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dim.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'And after these words Isildur described the Ring, such as he found it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It was hot when I first took it, hot as a glede, and my hand was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">scorched, so that I doubt if ever again I shall be free of the pain of it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Yet even as I write it is cooled, and it seemeth to shrink, though it loseth<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">neither its beauty nor its shape. Already the writing upon it, which at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">first was as clear as red flame, fadeth and is now only barely to be read.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It is fashioned in an elven-script of Eregion, for they have no letters in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mordor for such subtle work; but the language is unknown to me. I deem it to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">be a tongue of the Black Land, since it is foul and uncouth. What evil it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">saith I do not know; but I trace here a copy of it, lest it fade beyond<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">recall. The Ring misseth, maybe, the heat of Sauron's hand, which was black<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and yet burned like fire, and so Gil-galad was destroyed; and maybe were the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">gold made hot again, the writing would be refreshed, gut for my part I will<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">risk no hurt to this thing: of all the works of Sauron the only fair. It is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">precious to me, though I buy it with great pain.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™When I read these words, my quest was ended. For the traced writing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was indeed as Isildur guessed, in the tongue of Mordor and the servants of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Tower. And what was said therein was already known. For in the day that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sauron first put on the One, Celebrimbor, maker of the Three, was aware of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">him, and from afar he heard him speak these words, and so his evil purposes<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were revealed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'At once I took my leave of Denethor, but even as I went northwards,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">messages came to me out of Lurien that Aragorn had passed that way, and that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he had found the creature called Gollum. Therefore I went first to meet him<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and hear his tale. Into what deadly perils he had gone alone I dared not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">guess.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'There is little need to tell of them,â€™ said Aragorn. 'If a man must<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">needs walk in sight of the Black Gate, or tread the deadly flowers of Morgul<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Vale, then perils he will have. I, too, despaired at last, and I began my<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">homeward journey. And then, by fortune, I came suddenly on what I sought:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the marks of soft feet beside a muddy pool. But now the trail was fresh and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">swift, and it led not to Mordor but away. Along the skirts of the Dead<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Marshes I followed it, and then I had him. Lurking by a stagnant mere,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">peering in the water as the dark eve fell, I caught him, Gollum. He was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">covered with green slime. He will never love me, I fear; for he bit me, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I was not gentle. Nothing more did I ever get from his mouth than the marks<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of his teeth. I deemed it the worst part of all my journey, the road back,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">watching him day and night, making him walk before me with a halter on his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">neck, gagged, until he was tamed by lack of drink and food, driving him ever<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">towards Mirkwood. I brought him there at last and gave him to the Elves, for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">we had agreed that this should be done; and I was glad to be rid of his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">company, for he stank. For my part I hope never to look upon him again; but<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gandalf came and endured long speech with him.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Yes, long and weary,' said Gandalf, 'but not without profit. For one<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">thing, the tale he told of his loss agreed with that which Bilbo has now<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">told openly for the first time; but that mattered little, since I had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">already guessed it. But I learned then first that Gollum's ring came out of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Great River nigh to the Gladden Fields. And I learned also that he had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">possessed it long. Many lives of his small kind. The power of the ring had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">lengthened his years far beyond their span; but that power only the Great<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Rings wield.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'And if that is not proof enough, Galdor, there is the other test that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I spoke of. Upon this very ring which you have here seen held aloft, round<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and unadorned, the letters that Isildur reported may still be read, if one<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">has the strength of will to set the golden thing in the fire a while. That I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">have done, and this I have read:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The change in the wizard's voice was astounding. Suddenly it became<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">menacing, powerful, harsh as stone. A shadow seemed to pass over the high<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sun, and the porch for a moment grew dark. All trembled, and the Elves<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stopped their ears.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Never before has any voice dared to utter the words of that tongue in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">company breathed once more.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'And let us hope that none will ever speak it here again,' answered<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gandalf. 'Nonetheless I do not ask your pardon, Master Elrond. For if that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">tongue is not soon to be heard in every corner of the West, then let all put<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">treasure of the Enemy, fraught with all his malice; and in it lies a great<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">part of his strength of old. Out of the Black Years come the words that the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Smiths of Eregion heard, and knew that they had been betrayed:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">them all and in the Darkness bind them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Know also, my friends, that I learned more yet from Gollum. He was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">loth to speak and his tale was unclear, but it is beyond all doubt that he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">went to Mordor, and there all that he knew was forced from him. Thus the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Enemy knows now that the One is found, that it was long in the Shire; and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">since his servants have pursued it almost to our door, he soon will know,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">already he may know, even as I speak, that we have it here.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">All sat silent for a while, until at length Boromir spoke. 'He is a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">small thing, you say, this Gollum? Small, but great in mischief. What became<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'He is in prison, but no worse,' said Aragorn. 'He had suffered much.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There is no doubt that he was tormented, and the fear of Sauron lies black<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">on his heart. Still I for one am glad that he is safely kept by the watchful<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Alas! alas!â€™ cried Legolas, and in his fair elvish face there was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">great distress. 'The tidings that I was sent to bring must now be told. They<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Not through lack of watchfulness,' said Legolas; 'but perhaps through<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gluin rose and bowed, and Legolas continued. 'In the days of fair<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">weather we led Gollum through the woods; and there was a high tree standing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">alone far from the others which he liked to climb. Often we let him mount up<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to the highest branches, until he felt the free wind; but we set a guard at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the tree's foot. One day he refused to come down, and the guards had no mind<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to climb after him: he had learned the trick of clinging to boughs with his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">feet as well as with his hands; so they sat by the tree far into the night.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and fierce, but they came from over the mountains, and were unused to the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">woods. When the battle was over, we found that Gollum was gone, and his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">guards were slain or taken. It then seemed plain to us that the attack had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">been made for his rescue, and that he knew of it beforehand. How that was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">contrived we cannot guess; but Gollum is cunning, and the spies of the Enemy<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">are many. The dark things that were driven out in the year of the Dragon's<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fall have returned in greater numbers, and Mirkwood is again an evil place,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it escaped our skill, and we dared not continue the hunt; for we were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">drawing nigh to Dol Guldur, and that is still a very evil place; we do not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fugitives from the South; yet it seemed to me that on them sat a fear of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the circle of Isengard, trapped and alone, it was not easy to think that the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">should have gone more warily. So Saruman guessed, and he had concealed his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mind and deceived his messenger. It would have been useless in any case to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">try and win over the honest Radagast to treachery. He sought me in good<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'That was the undoing of Saruman's plot. For Radagast knew no reason<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">vie with him; tireless, swift as the flowing wind. Shadowfax they called<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">him. By day his coat glistens like silver; and by night it is like a shade,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">me. They had divided their forces, I learned: some remained on the eastern<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">borders, not far from the Greenway. and some invaded the Shire from the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">south. I came to Hobbiton and Frodo had gone; but I had words with old<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gamgee. Many words and few to the point. He had much to say about the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shortcomings of the new owners of Bag End.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">see it." But amidst his talk I gathered at last that Frodo had left Hobbiton<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">less than a week before, and that a black horseman had come to the Hill the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">same evening. Then I rode on in fear. I came to Buckland and found it in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">uproar, as busy as a hive of ants that has been stirred with a stick. I came<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to the house at Crickhollow, and it was broken open and empty; but on the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">threshold there lay a cloak that had been Frodo's. Then for a while hope<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">left me, and I did not wait to gather news, or I might have been comforted;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">but I rode on the trail of the Riders. It was hard to follow, for it went<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">many ways, and I was at a loss. But it seemed to me that one or two had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ridden towards Bree; and that way I went, for I thought of words that might<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in the night we heard more. Five at least came from the west, and they threw<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">down the gates and passed through Bree like a howling wind; and the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">besieged on the hill -top, in the old ring of Amon Syl. I was hard put to it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">would have been folly to try with all the Nine at my heels. Sol had to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">trust to Aragorn. But I hoped to draw some of them off, and yet reach<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Rivendell ahead of you and send out help. Four Riders did indeed follow me,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">helped a little, for there were only five, not nine, when your camp was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Ring, and news of its peril had already been brought here-which proved well<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'But in any case,â€™ said Glorfindel, 'to send the Ring to him would only<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">postpone the day of evil. He is far away. We could not now take it back to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">him, unguessed, unmarked by any spy. And even if we could, soon or late the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Lord of the Rings would learn of its hiding place and would bend all his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">power towards it. Could that power be defied by Bombadil alone? I think not.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I think that in the end, if all else is conquered, Bombadil will fall, Last<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">as he was First; and then Night will come.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I know little of Iarwain save the name,â€™ said Galdor; 'but Glorfindel,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I think, is right. Power to defy our Enemy is not in him, unless such power<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">is in the earth itself. And yet we see that Sauron can torture and destroy<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the very hills. What power still remains lies with us, here in Imladris, or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with Cirdan at the Havens, or in Lurien. But have they the strength, have we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">here the strength to withstand the Enemy, the coming of Sauron at the last,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">when all else is overthrown?â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I have not the strength,â€™ said Elrond; 'neither have they.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Then if the Ring cannot be kept from him for ever by strengthâ€™ said<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Glorfindel, 'two things only remain for us to attempt: to send it over the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sea, or to destroy it.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'But Gandalf has revealed to us that we cannot destroy it by any craft<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that we here possess,â€™ said Elrond. 'And they who dwell beyond the Sea would<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">not receive it: for good or ill it belongs to Middle-earth; it is for us who<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">still dwell here to deal with it.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™Then, said Glorfindel, â€™let us cast it into the deeps, and so make the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">lies of Saruman come true. For it is clear now that even at the Council his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">feet were already on a crooked path. He knew that the Ring was not lost for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ever, but wished us to think so; for he began to lust for it for himself.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Yet oft in lies truth is hidden: in the Sea it would be safe.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Not safe for ever,' said Gandalf. 'There are many things in the deep<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">waters; and seas and lands may change. And it is not our part here to take<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">thought only for a season, or for a few lives of Men, or for a passing age<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of the world. We should seek a final end of this menace, even if we do not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hope to make one.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'And that we shall not find on the roads to the Sea,' said Galdor. 'If<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the return to Iarwain be thought too dangerous, then flight to the S,a is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">now fraught with gravest peril. My heart tells me that Sauron will expect us<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to take the western way, when he learns what has befallen. He soon will. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Nine have been unhorsed indeed but that is but a respite, ere they find new<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">steeds and swifter. Only the waning might of Gondor stands now between him<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and a march in power along the coasts into the North; and if he comes,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">assailing the White Towers and the Havens, hereafter the Elves may have no<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">escape from the lengthening shadows of Middle-earth.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Long yet will that march be delayed,' said Boromir. 'Gondor wanes, you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">say. But Gondor stands, and even the end of its strength is still very<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">strong.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'And yet its vigilance can no longer keep back the Nine,' said Galdor.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'And other roads he may find that Gondor does not guard.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Then,' said Erestor, 'there are but two courses, as Glorfindel already<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">has declared: to hide the Ring for ever; or to unmake it. But both are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">beyond our power. Who will read this riddle for us?â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'None here can do so,' said Elrond gravely. 'At least none can foretell<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">what will come to pass, if we take this road or that. But it seems to me now<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">clear which is the road that we must take. The westward road seems easiest.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Therefore it must be shunned. It will be watched. Too often the Elves have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fled that way. Now at this last we must take a hard road, a road unforeseen.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There lies our hope, if hope it be. To walk into peril-to Mordor. We must<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">send the Ring to the Fire.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Silence fell again. Frodo, even in that fair house, looking out upon a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sunlit valley filled with the noise of clear waters, felt a dead darkness in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his heart. Boromir stirred, and Frodo looked at him. He was fingering his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">great horn and frowning. At length he spoke.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™I do not understand all this,' he said. 'Saruman is a traitor, but did<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>

</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he not have a glimpse of wisdom? Why do you speak ever of hiding and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">destroying? Why should we not think that the Great Ring has come into our<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hands to serve us in the very hour of need? Wielding it the Free Lords of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Free may surely defeat the Enemy. That is what he most fears, I deem.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Men of Gondor are valiant, and they will never submit; but they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">may be beaten down. Valour needs first strength, and then a weapon. Let the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Ring be your weapon, if it has such power as you say. Take it and go forth<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to victory!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™Alas, no,â€™ said Elrond. â€™We cannot use the Ruling Ring. That we now<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">know too well. It belongs to Sauron and was made by him alone, and is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">altogether evil. Its strength, Boromir, is too great for anyone to wield at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">will, save only those who have already a great power of their own. But for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">them it holds an even deadlier peril. The very desire of it corrupts the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">heart. Consider Saruman. If any of the Wise should with this Ring overthrow<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Lord of Mordor, using his own arts, he would then set himself on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sauronâ€™s throne, and yet another Dark Lord would appear. And that is another<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">reason why the Ring should be destroyed: as long as it is in the world it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">will be a danger even to the Wise. For nothing is evil in the beginning.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Even Sauron was not so. I fear to take the Ring to hide it. I will not take<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Ring to wield it.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Nor I,' said Gandalf.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Boromir looked at them doubtfully, but he bowed his head. 'So be it,â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he said. 'Then in Gondor we must trust to such weapons as we have. And at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the least, while the Wise ones guard this Ring, we will fight on. Mayhap the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sword-that-was-Broken may still stem the tide â€” if the hand that wields it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">has inherited not an heirloom only, but the sinews of the Kings of Men.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Who can tell?â€™ said Aragorn. 'But we will put it to the test one day.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'May the day not be too long delayed,' said Boromir. 'For though I do<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">not ask for aid, we need it. It would comfort us to know that others fought<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">also with all the means that they have.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Then be comforted,â€™ said Elrond. 'For there are other powers and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">realms that you know not, and they are hidden from you. Anduin the Great<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">flows past many shores, ere it comes to Argonath and the Gates of Gondor.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Still it might be well for all,' said Gluin the Dwarf, 'if all these<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">strengths were joined, and the powers of each were used in league. Other<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">rings there may be, less treacherous, that might be used in our need. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Seven are lost to us â€” if Balin has not found the ring of Thrur which was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the last; naught has been heard of it since Thrur perished in Moria. Indeed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I may now reveal that it was partly in hope to find that ring that Balin<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">went away.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Balin will find no ring in Moria,' said Gandalf. 'Thrur gave it to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Thrbin his son, but not Thrbin to Thorin. It was taken with torment from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Thrbin in the dungeons of Dol Guldur. I came too late.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Ah, alas!' cried Gluin. 'When will the day come of our revenge? But<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">still there are the Three. What of the Three Rings of the Elves? Very mighty<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Rings, it is said. Do not the Elf-lords keep them? Yet they too were made by<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Dark Lord long ago. Are they idle? I see Elf-lords here. Will they not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">say?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Elves returned no answer. 'Did you not hear me, Gluin?â€™ said<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Elrond. 'The Three were not made by Sauron, nor did he ever touch them. But<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of them it is not permitted to speak. So much only in this' hour of doubt I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">may now say. They are not idle. But they were not made as weapons of war or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">conquest: that is not their power. Those who made them did not desire<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">strength or domination or hoarded wealth, but understanding, making, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">healing, to preserve all things unstained. These things the Elves of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Middle-earth have in some measure gained, though with sorrow. But all that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">has been wrought by those who wield the Three will turn to their undoing,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and their minds and hearts will become revealed to Sauron, if he regains the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">One. It would be better if the Three had never been. That is his purpose.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'But what then would happen, if the Ruling Ring were destroyed as you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">counsel?â€™ asked Gluin.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'We know not for certain,' answered Elrond sadly. 'Some hope that the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Three Rings, which Sauron has never touched, would then become free, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">their rulers might heal the hurts of the world that he has wrought. But<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">maybe when the One has gone, the Three will fail, and many fair things will<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fade and be forgotten. That is my belief.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Yet all the Elves are willing to endure this chance,' said Glorfindel<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'if by it the power of Sauron may be broken, and the fear of his dominion be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">taken away for ever.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Thus we return once more to the destroying of the Ring,' said Erestor,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'and yet we come no nearer. What strength have we for the finding of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Fire in which it was made? That is the path of despair. Of folly I would<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">say, if the long wisdom of Elrond did not forbid me.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Despair, or folly?' said Gandalf. 'It is not despair, for despair is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">all things to a nicety in the scales of his malice. But the only measure<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that he knows is desire, desire for power; and so he judges all hearts. Into<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his heart the thought will not enter that any will refuse it, that having<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Ring we may seek to destroy it. If we seek this, we shall put him out of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">reckoning.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'At least for a while,' said Elrond. 'The road must be trod, but it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">will be very hard. And neither strength nor wisdom will carry us far upon<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it. This quest may be attempted by the weak with as much hope as the strong.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Yet such is oft the course of deeds that move the wheels of the world: small<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hands do them because they must, while the eyes of the great are elsewhere.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Very well, very well, Master Elrond!' said Bilbo suddenly. 'Say no<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">more! It is plain enough what you are pointing at. Bilbo the silly hobbit<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">started this affair, and Bilbo had better finish it, or himself. I was very<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">comfortable here, and getting on with my book. If you want to know, I am<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">just writing an ending for it. I had thought of putting: and he lived<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">happily ever afterwards to the end of his days. It is a good ending, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">none the worse for having been used before. Now I shall have to alter that:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it does not look like coming true; and anyway there will evidently have to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">be several more chapters, if I live to write them. It is a frightful<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">nuisance. When ought I to start?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">' Boromir looked in surprise at Bilbo, but the laughter died on his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">lips when he saw that all the others regarded the old hobbit with grave<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">respect. Only Gluin smiled, but his smile came from old memories.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Of course, my dear Bilbo,â€™ said Gandalf. 'If you had really started<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">this affair, you might be expected to finish it. But you know well enough<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">now that starting is too great a claim for any, and that only a small part<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">is played in great deeds by any hero. You need not bow! Though the word was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">meant, and we do not doubt that under jest you are making a valiant offer.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But one beyond your strength, Bilbo. You cannot take this thing back. It has<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">passed on. If you need my advice any longer, I should say that your part is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ended, unless as a recorder. Finish your book, and leave the ending<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">unaltered! There is still hope for it. But get ready to write a sequel, when<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they come back.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bilbo laughed. 'I have never known you give me pleasant advice before.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he said. 'As all your unpleasant advice has been good, I wonder if this<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">advice is not bad. Still, I don't suppose I have the strength or luck left<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to deal with the Ring. It has grown, and I have not. But tell me: what do<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you mean by they?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'The messengers who are sent with the Ring.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Exactly! And who are they to be? That seems to me what this Council<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">has to decide, and all that it has to decide. Elves may thrive on speech<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">alone, and Dwarves endure great weariness; but I am only an old hobbit, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I miss my meal at noon. Can't you think of some names now? Or put it off<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">till after dinner?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">No one answered. The noon-bell rang. Still no one spoke. Frodo glanced<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">at all the faces, but they were not turned to him. All the Council sat with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">downcast eyes, as if in deep thought. A great dread fell on him, as if he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was awaiting the pronouncement of some doom that he had long foreseen and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">vainly hoped might after all never be spoken. An overwhelming longing to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">rest and remain at peace by Bilbo's side in Rivendell filled all his heart.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At last with an effort he spoke, and wondered to hear his own words, as if<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">some other will was using his small voice.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I will take the Ring,' he said, 'though I do not know the way.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Elrond raised his eyes and looked at him, and Frodo felt his heart<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">pierced by the sudden keenness of the glance. 'If I understand aright all<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that I have heard,' he said, 'I think that this task is appointed for you,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo; and that if you do not find a way, no one will. This is the hour of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Shire-folk, when they arise from their quiet fields to shake the towers<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and counsels of the Great. Who of all the Wise could have foreseen it? Or,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">if they are wise, why should they expect to know it, until the hour has<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">struck?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'But it is a heavy burden. So heavy that none could lay it on another.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I do not lay it on you. But if you take it freely, I will say that your<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">choice is right; and though all the mighty elf-friends of old, Hador, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">HÂ®rin, and TÂ®rin, and Beren himself were assembled together your seat<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">should<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">be among them.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'But you won't send him off alone surely, Master?' cried Sam, unable to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">contain himself any longer, and jumping up from the corner where he had been<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">quietly sitting on the floor.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'No indeed!' said Elrond, turning towards him with a smile. 'You at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">least shall go with him. It is hardly possible to separate you from him,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">even when he is summoned to a secret council and you are not.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sam sat down, blushing and muttering. 'A nice pickle we have landed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ourselves in, Mr. Frodo!â€™ he said, shaking his head.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Chapter 3 . The Ring Goes South<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Later that day the hobbits held a meeting of their own in Bilbo's room.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Merry and Pippin were indignant when they heard that Sam had crept into the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Council, and had been chosen as Frodo's companion.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'It's most unfair,' said Pippin. 'Instead of throwing him out, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">clapping him in chains, Elrond goes and rewards him for his cheek!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Rewards!' said Frodo. 'I can't imagine a more severe punishment. You<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">are not thinking what you are saying: condemned to go on this hopeless<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">journey, a reward? Yesterday I dreamed that my task was done, and I could<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">rest here, a long while, perhaps for good.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I don't wonder,' said Merry, 'and I wish you could. But we are envying<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sam, not you. If you have to go, then it will be a punishment for any of us<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to be left behind, even in Rivendell. We have come a long way with you and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">been through some stiff times. We want to go on.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'That's what I meant,' said Pippin. 'We hobbits ought to stick<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">together, and we will. I shall go, unless they chain me up. There must be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">someone with intelligence in the party.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Then you certainly will not be chosen, Peregrin Took!' said Gandalf,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">looking in through the window, which was near the ground. 'But you are all<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">worrying yourselves unnecessarily. Nothing is decided yet.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Nothing decided!â€™ cried Pippin. â€™Then what were you all doing? You<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were shut up for hours.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">"Talking,' said Bilbo. 'There was a deal of talk, and everyone had an<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">eye-opener. Even old Gandalf. I think Legolas's bit of news about Gollum<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">caught even him on the hop, though he passed it off.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You were wrong,' said Gandalf. 'You were inattentive. I had already<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">heard of it from Gwaihir. If you want to know, the only real eye-openers, as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you put it, were you and Frodo; and I was the only one that was not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">surprised.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well, anyway,' said Bilbo, 'nothing was decided beyond choosing poor<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo and Sam. I was afraid all the time that it might come to that, if I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was let off. But if you ask me, Elrond will send out a fair number, when the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">reports come in. Have they started yet, Gandalf?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Yes,' said the wizard. 'Some of the scouts have been sent out already.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">More will go tomorrow. Elrond is sending Elves, and they will get in touch<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with the Rangers, and maybe with Thranduil's folk in Mirkwood. And<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Aragorn<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">has gone with Elrond's sons. We shall have to scour the lands all round for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">many long leagues before any move is made. So cheer up, Frodo! You will<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">probably make quite along stay here.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Ah!' said Sam gloomily. 'We'll just wait long enough for winter to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">come.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'That can't be helped,' said Bilbo. 'It's your fault partly, Frodo my<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">lad: insisting on waiting for my birthday. A funny way of honouring it, I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">can't help thinking. Not the day I should have chosen for letting the S.-B.s<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">into Bag End. But there it is: you can't wait now fill spring; and you can't<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">go till the reports come back.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">When winter first begins to bite<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and stones crack in the frosty night,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">when pools are black and trees are bare,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'tis evil in the Wild to fare.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But that I am afraid will be just your luck.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I am afraid it will,' said Gandalf. 'We can't start until we have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">found out about the Riders.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">T thought they were all destroyed in the flood,' said Merry.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You cannot destroy Ringwraiths like that,' said Gandalf. 'The power of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">their master is in them, and they stand or fall by him. We hope that they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were all unhorsed and unmasked, and so made for a while less dangerous; but<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">we must find out for certain. In the meantime you should try and forget your<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">troubles, Frodo. I do not know if I can do anything to help you; but I will<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">whisper this in your ears. Someone said that intelligence would be needed in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the party. He was right. I think I shall come with you.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">So great was Frodo's delight at this announcement that Gandalf left the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">window-sill, where he had been sitting, and took off his hat and bowed. 'I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">only said I think I shall come. Do not count on anything yet. In this matter<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Elrond will have much to say, and your friend the Strider. Which reminds me,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I want to see Elrond. I must be off.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'How long do you think I shall have here?â€™ said Frodo to Bilbo when<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gandalf had gone.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Oh, I don't know. I can't count days in Rivendell,' said Bilbo. 'But<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">quite long, I should think. We can have many a good talk. What about helping<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">me with my book, and making a start on the next? Have you thought of an<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ending?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Yes, several, and all are dark and unpleasant,' said Frodo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Oh, that won't do!' said Bilbo. 'Books ought to have good endings. How<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">would this do: and they all settled down and lived together happily ever<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">after?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'It will do well, if it ever comes to that,' said Frodo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Ah!' said Sam. 'And where will they live? That's what I often wonder.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For a while the hobbits continued to talk and think of the past journey<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and of the perils that lay ahead; but such was the virtue of the land of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Rivendell that soon all fear and anxiety was lifted from their minds. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">future, good or ill, was not forgotten, but ceased to have any power over<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the present. Health and hope grew strong in them, and they were content with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">each good day as it came, taking pleasure in every meal, and in every word<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and song.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">So the days slipped away, as each morning dawned bright and fair, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">each evening followed cool and clear. But autumn was waning fast; slowly the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">golden light faded to pale silver, and the lingering leaves fell from the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">naked trees. A wind began to blow chill from the Misty Mountains to the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">east. The Hunter's Moon waxed round in the night sky, and put to flight all<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the lesser stars. But low in the South one star shone red. Every night, as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Moon waned again, it shone brighter and brighter. Frodo could see it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">from his window, deep in the heavens burning like a watchful eye that glared<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">above the trees on the brink of the valley.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The hobbits had been nearly two months in the House of Elrond, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">November had gone by with the last shreds of autumn, and December was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">passing, when the scouts began to return. Some had gone north beyond the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">springs of the Hoarwell into the Ettenmoors; and others had gone west, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with the help of Aragorn and the Rangers had searched the lands far down the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Greyflood, as far as Tharbad, where the old North Road crossed the river by<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a ruined town. Many had gone east and south; and some of these had crossed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Mountains and entered Mirkwood, while others had climbed the pass at the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">source of the Gladden River, and had come down into Wilderland and over the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gladden Fields and so at length had reached the old home of Radagast at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Rhosgobel. Radagast was not there; and they had returned over the high pass<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that was called the Dimrill Stair. The sons of Elrond, Elladan and Elrohir,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were the last to return; they had made a great journey, passing down the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Silverlode into a strange country, but of their errand they would not speak<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to any save to Elrond.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In no region had the messengers discovered any signs or tidings of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Riders or other servants of the Enemy. Even from the Eagles of the Misty<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mountains they had learned no fresh news. Nothing had been seen or heard of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gollum; but the wild wolves were still gathering, and were hunting again far<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">up the Great River. Three of the black horses had been found at once drowned<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in the flooded Ford. On the rocks of the rapids below it searchers<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">discovered the bodies of five more, and also a long black cloak, slashed and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">tattered. Of the Black Riders no other trace was to be seen, and nowhere was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">their presence to be felt. It seemed that they had vanished from the North.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™Eight out of the Nine are accounted for at least,' said Gandalf. 'It<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">is rash to be too sure, yet I think that we may hope now that the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Ringwraiths were scattered, and have been obliged to return as best they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">could to their Master in Mordor, empty and shapeless.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Tf that is so, it will be some time before they can begin the hunt<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">again. Of course the Enemy has other servants, but they will have to journey<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">all the way to the borders of Rivendell before they can pick up our trail.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And if we are careful that will be hard to find. But we must delay no<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">longer.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Elrond summoned the hobbits to him. He looked gravely at Frodo. 'The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">time has come,' he said. 'If the Ring is to set out, it must go soon. But<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">those who go with it must not count on their errand being aided by war or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">force. They must pass into the domain of the Enemy far from aid. Do you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">still hold to your word, Frodo, that you will be the Ring-bearer?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I do,' said Frodo. 'I will go with Sam.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Then I cannot help you much, not even with counsel,' said Elrond. 'I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">can foresee very little of your road; and how your task is to be achieved I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">do not know. The Shadow has crept now to the feet of the Mountains, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">draws nigh even to the borders of Greyflood; and under the Shadow all is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dark to me. You will meet many foes, some open, and some disguised; and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">may find friends upon your way when you least look for it. I will send out<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">messages, such as I can contrive, to those whom I know in the wide world;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">but so perilous are the lands now become that some may well miscarry, or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">come no quicker than you yourself.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'And I will choose you companions to go with you, as far as they will<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">or fortune allows. The number must be few, since your hope is in speed and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">secrecy. Had I a host of Elves in armour of the Elder Days, it would avail<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">little, save to arouse the power of Mordor.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'The Company of the Ring shall be Nine; and the Nine Walkers shall be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">set against the Nine Riders that are evil. With you and your faithful<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">servant, Gandalf will go; for this shall be his great task, and maybe the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">end of his labours.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'For the rest, they shall represent the other Free Peoples of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">World: Elves, Dwarves, and Men. Legolas shall be for the Elves; and Gimli<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">son of Gluin for the Dwarves. They are willing to go at least to the passes<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of the Mountains, and maybe beyond. For men you shall have Aragorn son of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Arathorn, for the Ring of Isildur concerns him closely.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Strider!' said Frodo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™Yes,' he said with a smile. 'I ask leave once again to be your<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">companion, Frodo.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I would have begged you to come,â€™ said Frodo, 'only I thought you were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">going to Minas Tirith with Boromir.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I am,' said Aragorn. 'And the Sword-that-was-Broken shall be reforged<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ere I set out to war. But your road and our road lie together for many<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hundreds of miles. Therefore Boromir will also be in the Company. He is a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">valiant man.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™There remain two more to be found,' said Elrond. "These I will<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">consider. Of my household I may find some that it seems good to me to send.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'But that will leave no place for us!' cried Pippin in dismay. 'We<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">don't want to be left behind. We want to go with Frodo.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'That is because you do not understand and cannot imagine what lies<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ahead,' said Elrond.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Neither does Frodo,' said Gandalf, unexpectedly supporting Pippin.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Nor do any of us see clearly. It is true that if these hobbits understood<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the danger, they would not dare to go. But they would still wish to go, or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wish that they dared, and be shamed and unhappy. I think, Elrond, that in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">this matter it would be well to trust rather to their friendship than to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">great wisdom. Even if you chose for us an elf-lord, such as Glorfindel, he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">could not storm the Dark Tower, nor open the road to the Fire by the power<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that is in him.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You speak gravely,' said Elrond, 'but I am in doubt. The Shire, I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">forebode, is not free now from peril; and these two I had thought to send<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">their country, to warn the people of their danger. In any case, I judge that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the younger of these two, Peregrin Took, should remain. My heart is against<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his going.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Then, Master Elrond, you will have to lock me in prison, or send me<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">home tied in a sack,' said Pippin. 'For otherwise I shall follow the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Let it be so then. You shall go,â€™ said Elrond, and he sighed. 'Now the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">tale of Nine is filled. In seven days the Company must depart.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Sword of Elendil was forged anew by Elvish smiths, and on its blade<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was traced a device of seven stars set between the crescent Moon and the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and the light of the moon shone cold, and its edge was hard and keen. And<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Aragorn gave it a new name and called it AndÂ®ril, Flame of the West.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Aragorn and Gandalf walked together or sat speaking of their road and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the perils they would meet; and they pondered the storied and figured maps<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and books of lore that were in the house of Elrond. Sometimes Frodo was with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and Pippin were out and about, Frodo and Sam were to be found with Bilbo in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his own small room. Then Bilbo would read passages from his book (which<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">still seemed very incomplete), or scraps of his verses, or would take notes<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of Frodo's adventures.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">On the morning of the last day Frodo was alone with Bilbo, and the old<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hobbit pulled out from under his bed a wooden box. He lifted the lid and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fumbled inside.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Here is your sword,' he said. 'But it was broken, you know. I took it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to keep it safe but I've forgotten to ask if the smiths could mend it. No<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">time now.. So I thought, perhaps, you would care to have this, don't you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">know?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He took from the box a small sword in an old shabby leathern scabbard.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Then he drew it, and its polished and well-tended blade glittered suddenly,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">cold and bright. This is Sting,' he said, and thrust it with little effort<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">deep into a wooden beam. 'Take it, if you like. I shanâ€™t want it again, I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">expect.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo accepted it gratefully.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Also there is this!' said Bilbo, bringing out a parcel which seemed to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">be rather heavy for its size. He unwound several folds of old cloth, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">held up a small shirt of mail. It was close-woven of many rings, as supple<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">almost as linen, cold as ice, and harder than steel. It shone like moonlit<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">silver, and was studded with white gems. With it was a belt of pearl and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">crystal.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'It's a pretty thing, isn't it?' said Bilbo, moving it in the light.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'And useful. It is my dwarf-mail that Thorin gave me. I got it back from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Michel Delving before I started, and packed it with my luggage: I brought<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">all the mementoes of my Journey away with me, except the Ring. But I did not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">expect to use this, and I don't need it now, except to look at sometimes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">You hardly feel any weight when you put it on.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I should look â€” well, I don't think I should look right in it,' said<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Just what I said myself,â€™ said Bilbo. 'But never mind about looks. You<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">can wear it under your outer clothes. Come on! You must share this secret<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with me. Don't tell anybody else! But I should feel happier if I knew you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were wearing it. I have a fancy it would turn even the knives of the Black<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Riders,' he ended in a low voice.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Very well, I will take it,' said Frodo. Bilbo put it on him, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fastened Sting upon the glittering belt; and then Frodo put over the top his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">old weather-stained breeches, tunic, and jacket.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Just a plain hobbit you look,' said Bilbo. 'But there is more about<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you now than appears on the surface. Good luck to you!' He turned away and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">looked out of the window, trying to hum a tune.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I cannot thank you as I should, Bilbo, for this, and for all our past<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">kindnesses,' said Frodo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Don't try!' said the old hobbit, turning round and slapping him on the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">back. 'Ow!' he cried. 'You are too hard now to slap! But there you are:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Hobbits must stick together, and especially Bagginses. All I ask in return<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">is: take as much care of yourself as you can. and bring back all the news<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you can, and any old songs and tales you can come by. Iâ€™ll do my best to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">finish my book before you return. I should like to write the second book, if<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I am spared.' He broke off and turned to the window again, singing softly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I sit beside the fire and think<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of all that I have seen,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of meadow-flowers and butterflies<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in summers that have been;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Of yellow leaves and gossamer<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in autumns that there were,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with morning mist and silver sun<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and wind upon my hair.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I sit beside the fire and think<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of how the world will be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">when winter comes without a spring<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that I shall ever see.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For still there are so many things<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that I have never seen:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in every wood in every spring<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">there is a different green.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I sit beside the fire and think<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of people long ago,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and people who will see a world<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that I shall never know.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But all the while I sit and think<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of times there were before,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I listen for returning feet<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and voices at the door.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It was a cold grey day near the end of December. The East Wind was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">streaming through the bare branches of the trees, and seething in the dark<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">pines on the hills. Ragged clouds were hurrying overhead, dark and low. As<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the cheerless shadows of the early evening began to fall the Company made<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ready to set out. They were to start at dusk, for Elrond counselled them to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">journey under cover of night as often as they could, until they were far<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">from Ri vendell.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You should fear the many eyes of the servants of Sauron,' he said. 'I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">do not doubt that news of the discomfiture of the Riders has already reached<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">him, and he will be filled with wrath. Soon now his spies on foot and wing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">will be abroad in the northern lands. Even of the sky above you must beware<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">as you go on your way.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Company took little gear of war, for their hope was in secrecy not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in battle. Aragorn had AndÂ®ril but no other weapon, and he went forth clad<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">only in rusty green and brown, as a Ranger of the wilderness. Boromir had a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">long sword, in fashion like AndÂ®ril but of less lineage and he bore also a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shield and his war -horn.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Loud and clear it sounds in the valleys of the hills,' he said, 'and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">then let all the foes of Gondor flee!â€™ Putting it to his lips he blew a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">blast, and the echoes leapt from rock to rock, and all that heard that voice<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in Rivendell sprang to their feet.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Slow should you be to wind that horn again, Boromir, said Elrond.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'until you stand once more on the borders of your land, and dire need is on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Maybe,' said Boromir. 'But always I have let my horn cry at setting<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">forth, and though thereafter we may walk in the shadows, I will not go forth<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">as a thief in the night.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gimli the dwarf alone wore openly a short shirt of steel-rings, for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dwarves make light of burdens; and in his belt was a broad-bladed axe.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Legolas had a bow and a quiver, and at his belt a long white knife. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">younger hobbits wore the swords that they had taken from the barrow; but<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo took only Sting; and his mail-coat, as Bilbo wished, remained hidden.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gandalf bore his staff, but girt at his side was the elven-sword Glamdring,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the mate of Orcrist that lay now upon the breast of Thorin under the Lonely<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mountain.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">All were well furnished by Elrond with thick warm clothes, and they had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">jackets and cloaks lined with fur. Spare food and clothes and blankets and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">other needs were laden on a pony, none other than the poor beast that they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">had brought from Bree.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">?he stay in Rivendell had worked a great wonder of change on him: he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was glossy and seemed to have the vigour of youth. It was Sam who had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">insisted on choosing him, declaring that Bill (as he called him) would pine,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">if he did not come.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'That animal can nearly talk,' he said, 'and would talk, if he stayed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">here much longer. He gave me a look as plain as Mr. Pippin could speak it:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">if you don't let me go with you, Sam, I'll follow on my own.' So Bill was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">going as the beast of burden, yet he was the only member of the Company that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">did not seem depressed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Their farewells had been said in the great hall by the fire, and they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were only waiting now for Gandalf, who had not yet come out of the house. A<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">gleam of firelight came from the open doors, and soft lights were glowing in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">many windows. Bilbo huddled in a cloak stood silent on the doorstep beside<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo. Aragorn sat with his head bowed to his knees; only Elrond knew fully<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">what this hour meant to him. The others could be seen as grey shapes in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">darkness.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sam was standing by the pony, sucking his teeth, and staring moodily<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">into the gloom where the river roared stonily below; his desire for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">adventure was at its lowest ebb.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Bill, my lad,â€™ he said, 'you oughtn't to have took up with us. You<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">could have stayed here and et the best hay till the new grass comes.' Bill<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">swished his tail and said nothing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sam eased the pack on his shoulders, and went over anxiously in his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mind all the things that he had stowed in it, wondering if he had forgotten<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">anything: his chief treasure, his cooking gear; and the little box of salt<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that he always carried and refilled when he could; a good supply of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">pipe- weed (but not near enough, I'll warrant); flint and tinder; woollen<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hose: linen; various small belongings of his master's that Frodo had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">forgotten and Sam had stowed to bring them out in triumph when they were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">called for. He went through them all.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Rope!' he muttered. 'No rope! And only last night you said to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">yourself: "Sam, what about a bit of rope? You'll want it, if you haven't got<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At that moment Elrond came out with Gandalf, and he called the Company<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to him. 'This is my last word,' he said in a low voice. 'The Ring-bearer is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">setting out on the Quest of Mount Doom. On him alone is any charge laid:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">neither to cast away the Ring, nor to deliver it to any servant of the Enemy<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">nor indeed to let any handle it, save members of the Company and the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Council, and only then in gravest need. The others go with him as free<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">companions, to help him on his way. You may tarry, or come back, or turn<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">aside into other paths, as chance allows. The further you go, the less easy<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">will it be to withdraw; yet no oath or bond is laid on you to go further<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">than you will. For you do not yet know the strength of your hearts, and you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">cannot foresee what each may meet upon the road.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Faithless is he that says farewell when the road darkens,' said Gimli.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Maybe,' said Elrond, 'but let him not vow to walk in the dark, who has<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">not seen the nightfall.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Yet sworn word may strengthen quaking heart,' said Gimli.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Or break it,' said Elrond. 'Look not too far ahead! But go now with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">good hearts ! Farewell, and may the blessing of Elves and Men and all Free<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Folk go with you. May the stars shine upon your faces!â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Good . . . good luck!' cried Bilbo, stuttering with the cold. 'I don't<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">suppose you will be able to keep a diary, Frodo my lad, but I shall expect a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">full account when you get back. And don't be too long! Farewell!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Many others of Elrond's household stood in the shadows and watched them<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">go, bidding them farewell with soft voices. There was no laughter, and no<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">song or music. At last they turned away and faded silently into the dusk.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They crossed the bridge and wound slowly up the long steep paths that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">led out of the cloven vale of Rivendell; and they came at length to the high<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">moor where the wind hissed through the heather. Then with one glance at the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Last Flomely Flouse twinkling below them they strode away far into the night.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At the Ford of Bruinen they left the Road and turning southwards went<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">on by narrow paths among the folded lands. Their purpose was to hold this<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">course west of the Mountains for many miles and days. The country was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">much<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">rougher and more barren than in the green vale of the Great River in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Wilderland on the other side of the range, and their going would be slow;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">but they hoped in this way to escape the notice of unfriendly eyes. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">spies of Sauron had hitherto seldom been seen in this empty country, and the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">paths were little known except to the people of Rivendell.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gandalf walked in front, and with him went Aragorn, who knew this land<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">even in the dark. The others were in file behind, and Legolas whose eyes<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were keen was the rearguard. The first part of their journey was hard and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dreary, and Frodo remembered little of it, save the wind. For many sunless<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">days an icy blast came from the Mountains in the east, and no garment seemed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">able to keep out its searching fingers. Though the Company was well clad,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they seldom felt warm, either moving or at rest. They slept uneasily during<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the middle of the day, in some hollow of the land, or hidden under the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">tangled thorn-bushes that grew in thickets in many places. In the late<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">afternoon they were roused by the watch, and took their chief meal: cold and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">cheerless as a rule, for they could seldom risk the lighting of a fire. In<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the evening they went on again, always as nearly southward as they could<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">find a way.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At first it seemed to the hobbits that although they walked and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stumbled until they were weary, they were creeping forward like snails, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">getting nowhere. Each day the land looked much the same as it had the day<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">before. Yet steadily the mountains were drawing nearer. South of Rivendell<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they rose ever higher, and bent westwards; and about the feet of the main<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">range there was tumbled an ever wider land of bleak hills, and deep valleys<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">filled with turbulent waters. Paths were few and winding, and led them often<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">only to the edge of some sheer fall, or down into treacherous swamps.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They had been a fortnight on the way when the weather changed. The wind<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">suddenly fell and then veered round to the south. The swift-flowing clouds<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">lifted and melted away, and the sun came out, pale and bright. There came a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">cold clear dawn at the end of a long stumbling night-march. The travellers<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">reached a low ridge crowned with ancient holly -trees whose grey-green trunks<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">seemed to have been built out of the very stone of the hills. Their dark<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">leaves shone and their berries glowed red in the light of the rising sun.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Away in the south Frodo could see the dim shapes of lofty mountains<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that seemed now to stand across the path that the Company was taking. At the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">left of this high range rose three peaks; the tallest and nearest stood up<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">like a tooth tipped with snow; its great, bare, northern precipice was still<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">largely in the shadow, but where the sunlight slanted upon it, it glowed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">red.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gandalf stood at Frodoâ€™s side and looked out under his hand. 'We have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">done well,â€™ he said. 'We have reached the borders of the country that Men<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">call Hollin; many Elves lived here in happier days, when Eregion was its<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">name. Five-and-forty leagues as the crow flies we have come, though many<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">long miles further our feet have walked. The land and the weather will be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">milder now, but perhaps all the more dangerous.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Dangerous or not, a real sunrise is mighty welcome,â€™ said Frodo,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">throwing back his hood and letting the morning light fall on his face.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™But the mountains are ahead of us,â€™ said Pippin. 'We must have turned<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">eastwards in the night.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'No,' said Gandalf. 'But you see further ahead in the clear light.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Beyond those peaks the range bends round south-west. There are many maps<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Elrond's house, but I suppose you never thought to look at them?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Yes I did, sometimes,' said Pippin, 'but I don't remember them. Frodo<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">has a better head for that sort of thing.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I need no map,' said Gimli, who had come up with Legolas, and was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">gazing out before him with a strange light in his deep eyes. 'There is the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">land where our fathers worked of old, and we have wrought the image of those<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mountains into many works of metal and of stone, and into many songs and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">tales. They stand tall in our dreams: Baraz, Zirak, Shathyr.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Only once before have I seen them from afar in waking life, but I know<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">them and their names, for under them lies Khazad-dym, the Dwarrowdelf, that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">is now called the Black Pit, Moria in the Elvish tongue. Yonder stands<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Barazinbar, the Redhorn, cruel Caradhras; and beyond him are Silvertine and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Cloudyhead: Celebdil the White, and Fanuidhol the Grey, that we call<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Zirak-zigil and Bundushathyr.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'There the Misty Mountains divide, and between their arms lies the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">deep-shadowed valley which we cannot forget: Azanulbizar, the Dimrill Dale,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">which the Elves call Nanduhirion.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'It is for the Dimrill Dale that we are making,' said Gandalf. 'If we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">climb the pass that is called the Redhorn Gate, under the far side of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Caradhras, we shall come down by the Dimrill Stair into the deep vale of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Dwarves. There lies the Mirrormere, and there the River Silverlode rises in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">its icy springs.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Dark is the water of Kheled-zvram,' said Gimli, 'and cold are the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">springs of Kibil-nvla. My heart trembles at the thought that I may see them<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">soon.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'May you have joy of the sight, my good dwarf f said Gandalf. 'But<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">whatever you may do, we at least cannot stay in that valley. We must go down<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Silverlode into the secret woods, and so to the Great River, and then<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">f<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He paused.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Yes, and where then?' asked Merry.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'To the end of the journey â€” in the end,' said Gandalf. 'We cannot<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">look too far ahead. Let us be glad that the first stage is safely over. I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">think we will rest here, not only today but tonight as well. There is a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wholesome air about Hollin. Much evil must befall a country before it wholly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">forgets the Elves, if once they dwelt there.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">That is true,' said Legolas. 'But the Elves of this land were of a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">race strange to us of the silvan folk, and the trees and the grass do not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">now remember them: Only I hear the stones lament them: deep they delved us,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fair they wrought us, high they builded us; but they are gone. They are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">gone. They sought the Elavens long ago.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">That morning they lit a fire in a deep hollow shrouded by great bushes<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of holly, and their supper -breakfast was merrier than it had been since they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">set out. They did not hurry to bed afterwards, for they expected to have all<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the night to sleep in, and they did not mean to go on again until the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">evening of the next day. Only Aragorn was silent and restless. After a while<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he left the Company and wandered on to the ridge; there he stood in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shadow of a tree, looking out southwards and westwards, with his head posed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">as if he was listening. Then he returned to the brink of the dell and looked<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">down at the others laughing and talking.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'What is the matter, Strider?â€™ Merry called up. â€™What are you looking<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">for? Do you miss the East Wind?â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™No indeed,â€™ he answered. 'But I miss something. I have been in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">country of Hollin in many seasons. No folk dwell here now, but many other<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">creatures live here at all times, especially birds. Yet now all things but<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you are silent. I can feel it. There is no sound for miles about us, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">your voices seem to make the ground echo. I do not understand it.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gandalf looked up with sudden interest. 'But what do you guess is the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">reason?â€™ he asked. 'Is there more in it than surprise at seeing four<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hobbits, not to mention the rest of us, where people are so seldom seen or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">heard?â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I hope that is it,â€™ answered Aragorn. 'But I have a sense of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">watchfulness, and of fear, that I have never had here before.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">"Then we must be more careful,â€™ said Gandalf. â€™If you bring a Ranger<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with you, it is well to pay attention to him, especially if the Ranger is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Aragorn. We must stop talking aloud, rest quietly, and set the watch.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It was Samâ€™s turn that day to take the first watch, but Aragorn joined<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">him. The others fell asleep. Then the silence grew until even Sam felt it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The breathing of the sleepers could be plainly heard. The swish of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ponyâ€™s tail and the occasional movements of his feet became loud noises. Sam<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">could hear his own joints creaking, if he stirred. Dead silence was around<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">him, and over all hung a clear blue sky, as the Sun rode up from the East.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Away in the South a dark patch appeared, and grew, and drove north like<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">flying smoke in the wind.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'What's that, Strider? It donâ€™t look like a cloud,' said Sam in a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">whisper to Aragorn. He made no answer, he was gazing intently at the sky;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">but before long Sam could see for himself what was approaching. Flocks of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">birds, flying at great speed, were wheeling and circling, and traversing all<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the land as if they were searching for something; and they were steadily<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">drawing nearer.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Lie flat and still!' hissed Aragorn, pulling Sam down into the shade<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of a holly -bush; for a whole regiment of birds had broken away suddenly from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the main host, and came, flying low, straight towards the ridge. Sam thought<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they were a kind of crow of large size. As they passed overhead, in so dense<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a throng that their shadow followed them darkly over the ground below, one<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">harsh croak was heard.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Not until they had dwindled into the distance, north and west, and the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sky was again clear would Aragorn rise. Then he sprang up and went and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wakened Gandalf.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Regiments of black crows are flying over all the land between the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mountains and the Greyflood,' he said, 'and they have passed over Hollin.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They are not natives here; they are crebain out of Fangorn and Dunland. I do<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">not know what they are about: possibly there is some trouble away south from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">which they are fleeing; but I think they are spying out the land. I have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">also glimpsed many hawks flying high up in the sky. I think we ought to move<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">again this evening. Hollin is no longer wholesome for us: it is being<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">watched.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'And in that case so is the Redhorn Gate,' said Gandalf; 'and how we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">can get over that without being seen, I cannot imagine. But we will think of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that when we must. As for moving as soon as it is dark, I am afraid that you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">are right.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Luckily our fire made little smoke, and had burned low before the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">crebain came,' said Aragorn. 'It must be put out and not lit again.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well if that isn't a plague and a nuisance!' said Pippin. The news: no<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fire, and a move again by night, had been broken to him, as soon as he woke<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in the late afternoon. 'All because of a pack of crows! I had looked forward<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to a real good meal tonight: something hot.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well, you can go on looking forward,' said Gandalf. 'There may be many<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">unexpected feasts ahead for you. For myself I should like a pipe to smoke in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">comfort, and warmer feet. However, we are certain of one thing at any rate:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it will get warmer as we get south.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Too warm, I shouldn't wonder,' muttered Sam to Frodo. 'But I'm<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">beginning to think it's time we got a sight of that Fiery Mountain and saw<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the end of the Road, so to speak. I thought at first that this here Redhorn,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">or whatever its name is, might be it, till Gimli spoke his piece. A fair<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">jaw-cracker dwarf-language must be!' Maps conveyed nothing to Sam's mind,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and all distances in these strange lands seemed so vast that he was quite<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">out of his reckoning.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">All that day the Company remained in hiding. The dark birds passed over<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">now and again; but as the westering Sun grew red they disappeared<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">southwards. At dusk the Company set out, and turning now half east they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">steered their course towards Caradhras, which far away still glowed faintly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">red in the last light of the vanished Sun. One by one white stars sprang<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">forth as the sky faded.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Guided by Aragorn they struck a good path. It looked to Frodo like the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">remains of an ancient road, that had once been broad and well planned, from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Hollin to the mountain-pass. The Moon, now at the full, rose over the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mountains, and cast a pale light in which the shadows of stones were black.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Many of them looked to have been worked by hands, though now they lay<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">tumbled and ruinous in a bleak, barren land.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It was the cold chill hour before the first stir of dawn, and the moon<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was low. Frodo looked up at the sky. Suddenly he saw or felt a shadow pass<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">over the high stars, as if for a moment they faded and then flashed out<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">again. He shivered.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Did you see anything pass over?' he whispered to Gandalf, who was just<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ahead.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'No, but I felt it, whatever it was,' he answered. 'It may be nothing,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">only a wisp of thin cloud.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'It was moving fast then,' muttered Aragorn, 'and not with the wind.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Nothing further happened that night. The next morning dawned even<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">brighter than before. But the air was chill again; already the wind was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">turning back towards the east. For two more nights they marched on, climbing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">steadily but ever more slowly as their road wound up into the hills, and the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mountains towered up, nearer and nearer. On the third morning Caradhras rose<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">before them, a mighty peak, tipped with snow like silver, but with sheer<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">naked sides, dull red as if stained with blood.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There was a black look in the sky, and the sun was wan. The wind had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">gone now round to the north-east. Gandalf snuffed the air and looked back.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Winter deepens behind us,' he said quietly to Aragorn. 'The heights<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">away north are whiter than they were; snow is lying far down their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shoulders. Tonight we shall be on our way high up towards the Redhorn Gate.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">We may well be seen by watchers on that narrow path, and waylaid by some<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">evil; but the weather may prove a more deadly enemy than any. What do you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">think of your course now, Aragorn?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo overheard these words, and understood that Gandalf and Aragorn<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were continuing some debate that had begun long before. He listened<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">anxiously.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I think no good of our course from beginning to end, as you know well,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gandalf,' answered Aragorn. 'And perils known and unknown will grow as we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">go<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">on. But we must go on; and it is no good our delaying the passage of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mountains. Further south there are no passes, till one comes to the Gap of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Rohan. I do not trust that way since your news of Saruman. Who knows<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">which<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">side now the marshals of the Horse-lords serve?â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Who knows indeed!' said Gandalf. 'But there is another way, and not by<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the pass of Caradhras: the dark and secret way that we have spoken of.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'But let us not speak of it again! Not yet. Say nothing to the others I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">beg, not until it is plain that there is no other way.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'We must decide before we go further,' answered Gandalf.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Then let us weigh the matter in our minds, while the others rest and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sleep,' said Aragorn.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the late afternoon, while the others were finishing their breakfast,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gandalf and Aragorn went aside together and stood looking at Caradhras. Its<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sides were now dark and sullen, and its head was in grey cloud. Frodo<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">watched them, wondering which way the debate would go. When they returned<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Company Gandalf spoke, and then he knew that it had been decided to face<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the weather and the high pass. He was relieved. He could not guess what was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the other dark and secret way, but the very mention of it had seemed to fill<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Aragorn with dismay, and Frodo was glad that it had been abandoned.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'From signs that we have seen lately,â€™ said Gandalf, â€™I fear that the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Redhorn Gate may be watched; and also I have doubts of the weather that is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">coming up behind. Snow may come. We must go with all the speed that we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">can.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Even so it will take us more than two marches before we reach the top of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">pass. Dark will come early this evening. We must leave as soon as you can<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">get ready.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I will add a word of advice, if I may,' said Boromir. 'I was born<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">under the shadow of the White Mountains and know something of journeys<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the high places. We shall meet bitter cold, if no worse, before we come down<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">on the other side. It will not help us to keep so secret that we are frozen<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to death. When we leave here, where there are still a few trees and bushes,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">each of us should carry a faggot of wood, as large as he can bear.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'And Bill could take a bit more, couldn't you lad?' said Sam. The pony<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">looked at him mournfully.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Very well,' said Gandalf. 'But we must not use the wood â€” not unless<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it is a choice between fire and death.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Company set out again with good speed at first; but soon their way<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">became steep and difficult. The twisting and climbing road had in many<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">places almost disappeared, and was blocked with many fallen stones. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">night grew deadly dark under great clouds. A bitter wind swirled among the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">rocks. By midnight they had climbed to the knees of the great mountains. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">narrow path now wound under a sheer wall of cliffs to the left, above which<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the grim flanks of Caradhras towered up invisible in the gloom; on the right<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was a gulf of darkness where the land fell suddenly into a deep ravine.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Laboriously they climbed a sharp slope and halted for a moment at the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">top. Frodo felt a soft touch on his face. He put out his arm and saw the dim<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">white flakes of snow settling on his sleeve.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They went on. But before long the snow was falling fast, filling all<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the air, and swirling into Frodo's eyes. The dark bent shapes of Gandalf and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Aragorn only a pace or two ahead could hardly be seen.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I don't like this at all,' panted Sam just behind. 'Snow's all right<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">on a fine morning, but I like to be in bed while it's falling. I wish this<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bilbo) could remember the Fell Winter of 131 1, when the white wolves<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">invaded<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Shire over the frozen Brandywine.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gandalf halted. Snow was thick on his hood and shoulders; it was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">already ankle-deep about his boots.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">"This is what I feared,' he said. 'What do you say now, Aragorn?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'That I feared it too,' Aragorn answered, 'but less than other things.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I knew the risk of snow, though it seldom falls heavily so far south, save<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">high up in the mountains. But we are not high yet; we are still far down,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">where the paths are usually open all the winter.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I wonder if this is a contrivance of the Enemy,' said Boromir. "They<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">say in my land that he can govern the storms in the Mountains of Shadow that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stand upon the borders of Mordor. He has strange powers and many allies.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'His arm has grown long indeed,' said Gimli, 'if he can draw snow down<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">from the North to trouble us here three hundred leagues away.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'His arm has grown long,' said Gandalf.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">While they were halted, the wind died down, and the snow slackened<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">until it almost ceased. They tramped on again. But they had not gone more<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">than a furlong when the storm returned with fresh fury. The wind whistled<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and the snow became a blinding blizzard. Soon even Boromir found it hard to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">keep going. The hobbits, bent nearly double, toiled along behind the taller<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">folk, but it was plain that they could not go much further, if the snow<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">continued. Frodo's feet felt like lead. Pippin was dragging behind. Even<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gimli, as stout as any dwarf could be, was grumbling as he trudged.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Company halted suddenly, as if they had come to an agreement<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">without any words being spoken. They heard eerie noises in the darkness<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">round them. It may have been only a trick of the wind in the cracks and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">gullies of the rocky wall, but the sounds were those of shrill cries, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wild howls of laughter. Stones began to fall from the mountain-side,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">whistling over their heads, or crashing on the path beside them. Every now<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and again they heard a dull rumble, as a great boulder rolled down from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hidden heights above.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'We cannot go further tonight,' said Boromir. 'Let those call it the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wind who will; there are fell voices on the air; and these stones are aimed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">at us.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I do call it the wind,' said Aragorn. 'But that does not make what you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">say untrue. There are many evil and unfriendly things in the world that have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">than he.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™Caradhras was called the Cruel, and had an ill name, said Gimli, 'long<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">years ago, when rumour of Sauron had not been heard in these lands.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'It matters little who is the enemy, if we cannot beat off his attack;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">said Gandalf.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'But what can we do?' cried Pippin miserably. He was leaning on Merry<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and Frodo, and he was shivering.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Either stop where we are, or go back,' said Gandalf. â€™It is no good<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">going on. Only a little higher, if I remember rightly, this path leaves the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">cliff and runs into a wide shallow trough at the bottom of a long hard<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">slope. We should have no shelter there from snow, or stones â€” or anything<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">else.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'And it is no good going back while the storm holds,' said Aragorn. 'We<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">have passed no place on the way up that offered more shelter than this<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">cliff-wall we are under now.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Shelter!' muttered Sam. 'If this is shelter, then one wall and no roof<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">make a house.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Company now gathered together as close to the cliff as they could.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It faced southwards, and near the bottom it leaned out a little, so that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they hoped it would give them some protection from the northerly wind and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">from the falling stones. But eddying blasts swirled round them from every<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">side, and the snow flowed down in ever denser clouds.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They huddled together with their backs to the wall. Bill the pony stood<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">patiently but dejectedly in front of the hobbits, and screened them a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">little; but before long the drifting snow was above his hocks, and it went<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">on mounting. If they had had no larger companions the hobbits would soon<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">have been entirely buried.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A great sleepiness came over Frodo; he felt himself sinking fast into a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">warm and hazy dream. He thought a fire was heating his toes, and out of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shadows on the other side of the hearth he heard Bilbo's voice speaking. /<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">don 't think much of your diary , he said. Snowstorms on January the twelfth:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">there was no need to come back to report that!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But I wanted rest and sleep, Bilbo , Frodo answered with an effort, when<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he felt himself shaken, and he came back painfully to wakefulness. Boromir<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">had lifted him off the ground out of a nest of snow.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'This will be the death of the halflings, Gandalf,' said Boromir. 'It<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">is useless to sit here until the snow goes over our heads. We must do<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">something to save ourselves.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Give them this,â€™ said Gandalf, searching in his pack and drawing out a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">leathern flask. 'Just a mouthful each â€” for all of us. It is very precious.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It is miruvor, the cordial of Imladris. Elrond gave it to me at our parting.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Pass it round!â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As soon as Frodo had swallowed a little of the warm and fragrant liquor<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he felt a new strength of heart, and the heavy drowsiness left his limbs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The others also revived and found fresh hope and vigour. But the snow did<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">not relent. It whirled about them thicker than ever, and the wind blew<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">louder.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™What do you say to fire?â€™ asked Boromir suddenly. â€™The choice seems<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">near now between fire and death, Gandalf. Doubtless we shall be hidden from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">all unfriendly eyes when the snow has covered us, but that will not help<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">us.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™You may make a fire, if you can,â€™ answered Gandalf. â€™If there are any<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">watchers that can endure this storm, then they can see us, fire or no.â€™ But<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">though they had brought wood and kindlings by the advice of Boromir, it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">passed the skill of Elf or even Dwarf to strike a flame that would hold amid<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the swirling wind or catch in the wet fuel. At last reluctantly Gandalf<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">himself took a hand. Picking up a faggot he held it aloft for a moment, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">then with a word of command, naur an edraith ammen ! he thrust the end of his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">staff into the midst of it. At once a great spout of green and blue flame<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sprang out, and the wood flared and sputtered.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'If there are any to see, then I at least am revealed to them,â€™ he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">said. â€™I have written Gandalf is here in signs that all can read from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Rivendell to the mouths of Anduin.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But the Company cared no longer for watchers or unfriendly eyes. Their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hearts were rejoiced to see the light of the fire. The wood burned merrily;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and though all round it the snow hissed, and pools of slush crept under<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">their feet, they warmed their hands gladly at the blaze. There they stood,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stooping in a circle round the little dancing and blowing flames. A red<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">light was on their tired and anxious faces; behind them the night was like a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">black wall.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But the wood was burning fast, and the snow still fell.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The fire burned low. and the last faggot was thrown on.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The night is getting old,' said Aragorn. "The dawn is not far off.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'If any dawn can pierce these clouds,' said Gimli.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Boromir stepped out of the circle and stared up into the blackness.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'The snow is growing less,' he said, 'and the wind is quieter.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo gazed wearily at the flakes still falling out of the dark to be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">revealed white for a moment in the light of the dying fire; but for a long<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">time he could see no sign of their slackening. Then suddenly, as sleep was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">beginning to creep over him again, he was aware that the wind had indeed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fallen, and the flakes were becoming larger and fewer. Very slowly a dim<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">light began to grow. At last the snow stopped altogether.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As the light grew stronger it showed a silent shrouded world. Below<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">their refuge were white humps and domes and shapeless deeps beneath which<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the path that they had trodden was altogether lost; but the heights above<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were hidden in great clouds still heavy with the threat of snow.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gimli looked up and shook his head. 'Caradhras has not forgiven us.' he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">said. 'He has more snow yet to fling at us, if we go on. The sooner we go<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">back and down the better.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">To this all agreed, but their retreat was now difficult. It might well<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">prove impossible. Only a few paces from the ashes of their fire the snow lay<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">many feet deep, higher than the heads of the hobbits; in places it had been<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">scooped and piled by the wind into great drifts against the cliff.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'If Gandalf would go before us with a bright flame, he might melt a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">path for you,' said Legolas. The storm had troubled him little, and he alone<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of the Company remained still light of heart.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'If Elves could fly over mountains, they might fetch the Sun to save<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">us,â€™ answered Gandalf. 'But I must have something to work on. I cannot burn<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">snow.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well,' said Boromir, 'when heads are at a loss bodies must serve, as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">we say in my country. The strongest of us must seek a way. See! Though all<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">is now snow-clad, our path, as we came up, turned about that shoulder of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">rock down yonder. It was there that the snow first began to burden us. If we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">could reach that point, maybe it would prove easier beyond. It is no more<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">than a furlong off, I guess.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Then let us force a path thither, you and I!â€™ said Aragorn.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Aragorn was the tallest of the Company, but Boromir, little less in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">height, was broader and heavier in build. He led the way, and Aragorn<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">followed him. Slowly they moved off, and were soon toiling heavily. In<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">places the snow was breast-high, and often Boromir seemed to be swimming<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">burrowing with his great arms rather than walking.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Legolas watched them for a while with a smile upon his lips, and then<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he turned to the others. 'The strongest must seek a way, say you? But I say:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">let a ploughman plough, but choose an otter for swimming, and for running<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">light over grass and leaf or over snow-an Elf.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">With that he sprang forth nimbly, and then Frodo noticed as if for the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">first time, though he had long known it, that the Elf had no boots, but wore<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">only light shoes, as he always did, and his feet made little imprint in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">snow.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Farewell!' he said to Gandalf. 'I go to find the Sun!' Then swift as a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">runner over firm sand he shot away, and quickly overtaking the toiling men,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with a wave of his hand he passed them, and sped into the distance, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">vanished round the rocky turn.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The others waited huddled together, watching until Boromir and Aragorn<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dwindled into black specks in the whiteness. At length they too passed from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sight. The time dragged on. The clouds lowered, and now a few flakes of snow<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">came curling down again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">An hour, maybe, went by, though it seemed far longer, and then at last<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they saw Legolas coming back. At the same time Boromir and Aragorn<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">reappeared round the bend far behind him and came labouring up the slope.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well,' cried Legolas as he ran up, 'I have not brought the Sun. She is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">walking in the blue fields of the South, and a little wreath of snow on this<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Redhorn hillock troubles her not at all. But I have brought back a gleam of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">good hope for those who are doomed to go on feet. There is the greatest<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wind-drift of all just beyond the turn, and there our Strong Men were almost<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">buried. They despaired, until I returned and told them that the drift was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">little wider than a wall. And on the other side the snow suddenly grows<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">less, while further down it is no more than a white coverlet to cool a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hobbit's toes.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Ah, it is as I said,' growled Gimli. 'It was no ordinary storm. It is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the ill will of Caradhras. He does not love Elves and Dwarves, and that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">drift was laid to cut off our escape.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'But happily your Caradhras has forgotten that you have Men with you,'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">said Boromir, who came up at that moment. 'And doughty Men too, if I may<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">say<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it; though lesser men with spades might have served you better. Still, we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">have thrust a lane through the drift; and for that all here may be grateful<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">who cannot run as light as Elves.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'But how are we to get down there, even if you have cut through the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">drift?' said Pippin, voicing the thought of all the hobbits.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Have hope!' said Boromir. 'I am weary, but I still have some strength<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">left, and Aragorn too. We will bear the little folk. The others no doubt<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">will make shift to tread the path behind us. Come, Master Peregrin! I will<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">begin with you.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He lifted up the hobbit. 'Cling to my back! I shall need my arms' he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">said and strode forward. Aragorn with Merry came behind. Pippin marvelled at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his strength, seeing the passage that he had already forced with no other<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">tool than his great limbs. Even now, burdened as he was, he was widening the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">track for those who followed, thrusting the snow aside as he went.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They came at length to the great drift. It was flung across the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mountain-path like a sheer and sudden wall, and its crest, sharp as if<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shaped with knives, reared up more than twice the height of Boromir; but<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">through the middle a passage had been beaten, rising and falling like a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">bridge. On the far side Merry and Pippin were set down, and there they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">waited with Legolas for the rest of the Company to arrive.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After a while Boromir returned carrying Sam. Behind in the narrow but<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">now well-trodden track came Gandalf, leading Bill with Gimli perched among<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the baggage. Last came Aragorn carrying Frodo. They passed through the lane;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">but hardly had Frodo touched the ground when with a deep rumble there rolled<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">down a fall of stones and slithering snow. The spray of it half blinded the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Company as they crouched against the cliff, and when the air cleared again<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they saw that the path was blocked behind them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Enough, enough!' cried Gimli. 'We are departing as quickly as we may!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And indeed with that last stroke the malice of the mountain seemed to be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">expended, as if Caradhras was satisfied that the invaders had been beaten<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">off and would not dare to return. The threat of snow lifted; the clouds<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">began to break and the light grew broader.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As Legolas had reported, they found that the snow became steadily more<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shallow as they went down, so that even the hobbits could trudge along. Soon<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they all stood once more on the flat shelf at the head of the steep slope<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">where they had felt the first flakes of snow the night before.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The morning was now far advanced. From the high place they looked back<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">westwards over the lower lands. Far away in the tumble of country that lay<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">at the foot of the mountain was the dell from which they had started to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">climb the pass.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodoâ€™s legs ached. He was chilled to the bone and hungry; and his head<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was dizzy as he thought of the long and painful march downhill. Black specks<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">swam before his eyes. He rubbed them, but the black specks remained. In the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">distance below him, but still high above the lower foothills, dark dots were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">circling in the air.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'The birds again!â€™ said Aragorn, pointing down.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">That cannot be helped now,â€™ said Gandalf. 'Whether they are good or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">evil, or have nothing to do with us at all, we must go down at once. Not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">even on the knees of Caradhras will we wait for another night-fall!â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A cold wind flowed down behind them, as they turned their backs on the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Redhorn Gate, and stumbled wearily down the slope. Caradhras had defeated<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It was evening, and the grey light was again waning fast, when they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">halted for the night. They were very weary. The mountains were veiled in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">deepening dusk, and the wind was cold. Gandalf spared them one more<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">council.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'We cannot, of course, go on again tonight,' he said. 'The attack on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Redhorn Gate has tired us out, and we must rest here for a while.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'And then where are we to go? â€™ asked Frodo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'We still have our journey and our errand before us,' answered Gandalf.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'We have no choice but to go on, or to return to Rivendell.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Pippin's face brightened visibly at the mere mention of return to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Rivendell; Merry and Sam looked up hopefully. But Aragorn and Boromir<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">made<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">no sign. Frodo looked troubled.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I wish I was back there,â€™ he said. 'But how can I return without shame<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€” unless there is indeed no other way, and we are already defeated? â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You are right, Frodo,' said Gandalf: 'to go back is to admit defeat<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and face worse defeat to come. If we go back now, then the Ring must remain<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">there: we shall not be able to set out again. Then sooner or later Rivendell<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">will be besieged, and after a brief and bitter time it will be destroyed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Ringwraiths are deadly enemies, but they are only shadows yet of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sank back into gloom.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'There is a way that we may attempt,' said Gandalf. I thought from the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">beginning, when first I considered this journey, that we should try it. But<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it is not a pleasant way, and I have not spoken of it to the Company before.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Aragorn was against it, until the pass over the mountains had at least been<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">tried.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'If it is a worse road than the Redhorn Gate, then it must be evil<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">indeed,' said Merry. 'But you had better tell us about it, and let us know<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the worst at once.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'The road that I speak of leads to the Mines of Moria,' said Gandalf.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Only Gimli lifted up his head; a smouldering fire was in his eyes. On all<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the others a dread fell at the mention of that name. Even to the hobbits it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was a legend of vague fear:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'The road may lead to Moria, but how can we hope that it will lead<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">through Moria? â€™ said Aragorn darkly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'It is a name of ill omen,' said Boromir. 'Nor do I see the need to go<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">there. If we cannot cross the mountains, let us journey southwards, until we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">come to the Gap of Rohan, where men are friendly to my people, taking the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">road that I followed on my way hither. Or we might pass by and cross the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Isen into Langstrand and Lebennin, and so come to Gondor from the regions<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">nigh to the sea.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Things have changed since you came north, Boromir,' answered Gandalf.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Did you not hear what I told you of Saruman? With him I may have business<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of my own ere all is over. But the Ring must not come near Isengard, if that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">can by any means be prevented. The Gap of Rohan is closed to us while we go<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with the Bearer.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'As for the longer road: we cannot afford the time. We might spend a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">year in such a journey, and we should pass through many lands that are empty<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and harbourless. Yet they would not be safe. The watchful eyes both of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Saruman and of the Enemy are on them. When you came north, Boromir, you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in the Enemy's eyes only one stray wanderer from the South and a matter of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">small concern to him: his mind was busy with the pursuit of the Ring. But<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you return now as a member of the Ring's Company, and you are in peril as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">long as you remain with us. The danger will increase with every league that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">we go south under the naked sky.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Since our open attempt on the mountain -pass our plight has become more<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">desperate, I fear. I see now little hope, if we do not soon vanish from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sight for a while, and cover our trail. Therefore I advise that we should go<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">neither over the mountains, nor round them, but under them. That is a road<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">at any rate that the Enemy will least expect us to take.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'We do not know what he expects,' said Boromir. 'lie may watch all<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">roads, likely and unlikely. In that case to enter Moria would be to walk<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">into a trap, hardly better than knocking at the gates of the Dark Tower<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You speak of what you do not know, when you liken Moria to the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stronghold of Sauron,' answered Gandalf. 'I alone of you have ever been in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Dol Guldur. Those who pass the gates of Barad-dyr do not return. But I would<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">not lead you into Moria if there were no hope of coming out again. If there<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">are Ores there, it may prove ill for us, that is true. But most of the Ores<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of the Misty Mountains were scattered or destroyed in the Battle of Five<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™I will tread the path with you, Gandalf! â€™ said Gimli. â€™I will go and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">look on the halls of Durin, whatever may wait there-if you can find the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Good, Gimli! ' said Gandalf. 'You encourage me. We will seek the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hidden doors together. And we will come through. In the ruins of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sought there long for Thrbin son of Thrur after he was lost. I passed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I too once passed the Dimrill Gate,' said Aragorn quietly; 'but though<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I also came out again, the memory is very evil. I do not wish to enter Moria<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a second time.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Of course not! ' said Gandalf. 'Who would? But the question is: who<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">will follow me, if I lead you there? '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I will,' said Gimli eagerly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I will,' said Aragorn heavily. 'You followed my lead almost to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">disaster in the snow, and have said no word of blame. I will follow your<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">lead now â€” if this last warning does not move you. It is not of the Ring,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">nor of us others that I am thinking now, but of you, Gandalf. And I say to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you: if you pass the doors of Moria, beware! â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I do not wish to go to Moria,' said Legolas.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The hobbits said nothing. Sam looked at Frodo. At last Frodo spoke. 'I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">do not wish to go,' he said; 'but neither do I wish to refuse the advice of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At these words all fell into silent thought. They heard the wind<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hissing among the rocks and trees, and there was a howling and wailing round<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">them in the empty spaces of the night.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Suddenly Aragorn leapt to his feet. 'How the wind howls ! ' he cried.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'It is howling with wolf-voices. The Wargs have come west of the Mountains!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Need we wait until morning then? ' said Gandalf. 'It is as I said. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hunt is up! Even if we live to see the dawn, who now will wish to journey<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">south by night with the wild wolves on his trail? â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'How far is Moria? ' asked Boromir.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'There was a door south-west of Caradhras, some fifteen miles as the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">crow flies, and maybe twenty as the wolf runs,' answered Gandalf grimly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Then let us start as soon as it is light tomorrow, if we can,' said<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Boromir. 'The wolf that one hears is worse than the ore that one fears.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'True!' said Aragorn, loosening his sword in its sheath. 'But where the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">warg howls, there also the ore prowls.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I wish I had taken Elrond's advice,' muttered Pippin to Sam. I am no<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">good after all. There is not enough of the breed of Bandobras the Bullroarer<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in me: these howls freeze my blood. I don't ever remember feeling so<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wretched.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'My heart's right down in my toes, Mr. Pippin,' said Sam. 'But we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">aren't etten yet, and there are some stout folk here with us. Whatever may<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">be in store for old Gandalf, I'll wager it isn't a wolfs belly.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For their defence in the night the Company climbed to the top of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">small hill under which they had been sheltering, it was crowned with a knot<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of old and twisted trees, about which lay a broken circle of boulder stones.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the midst of this they lit a fire, for there was no hope that darkness<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and silence would keep their trail from discovery by the hunting packs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Round the fire they sat, and those that were not on guard dozed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">uneasily. Poor Bill the pony trembled and sweated where he stood. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">howling of the wolves was now all round them, sometimes nearer and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sometimes<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">further off. In the dead of the night many shining eyes were seen peering<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">over the brow of the hill. Some advanced almost to the ring of stones. At a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">gap in the circle a great dark wolf-shape could be seen halted, gazing at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">them. A shuddering howl broke from him, as if he were a captain summoning<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his pack to the assault.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gandalf stood up and strode forward, holding his staff aloft. 'Listen,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Hound of Sauron! â€™ he cried. 'Gandalf is here. Fly, if you value your foul<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The wolf snarled and sprang towards them with a great leap. At that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">moment there was a sharp twang. Legolas had loosed his bow. There was a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hideous yell, and the leaping shape thudded to the ground; the elvish arrow<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">had pierced its throat. The watching eyes were suddenly extinguished.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gandalf and Aragorn strode forward, but the hill was deserted; the hunting<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">packs had fled. All about them the darkness grew silent, and no cry came on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the sighing wind.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The night was old, and westward the waning moon was setting, gleaming<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fitfully through the breaking clouds. Suddenly Frodo started from sleep.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Without warning a storm of howls broke out fierce and wild all about the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">camp. A great host of Wargs had gathered silently and was now attacking them<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">from every side at once.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Fling fuel on the fire!â€™ cried Gandalf to the hobbits. 'Draw your<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">blades, and stand back to back!â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the leaping light, as the fresh wood blazed up, Frodo saw many grey<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shapes spring over the ring of stones. More and more followed. Through the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">throat of one huge leader Aragorn passed his sword with a thrust; with a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">great sweep Boromir hewed the head off another. Beside them Gimli stood<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his stout legs apart, wielding his dwarf-axe. The bow of Legolas was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">singing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the wavering firelight Gandalf seemed suddenly to grow: he rose up,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a great menacing shape like the monument of some ancient king of stone set<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">upon a hill. Stooping like a cloud, he lifted a burning branch and strode to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">meet the wolves. They gave back before him. High in the air he tossed the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">blazing brand. It flared with a sudden white radiance like lightning; and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his voice rolled like thunder.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">' Naur an edraith ammen! Naur dan i ngaurhoth!' he cried.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There was a roar and a crackle, and the tree above him burst into a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">leaf and bloom of blinding flame. The fire leapt from tree-top to tree -top.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The whole hill was crowned with dazzling light. The swords and knives of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">defenders shone and flickered. The last arrow of Legolas kindled in the air<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">as it flew, and plunged burning into the heart of a great wolf-chieftain.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">All the others fled.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Slowly the fire died till nothing was left but falling ash and sparks;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a bitter smoke curled above the burned tree-stumps, and blew darkly from the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hill, as the first light of dawn came dimly in the sky. Their enemies were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">routed and did not return.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'What did I tell you, Mr. Pippin? ' said Sam, she/thing his sword.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Wolves wonâ€™t get him. That was an eye-opener, and no mistake! Nearly singed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the hair off my head!â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">When the full light of the morning came no signs of the wolves were to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">be found, and they looked in vain for the bodies of the dead. No trace of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the fight remained but the charred trees and the arrows of Legolas lying on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the hill-top. All were undamaged save one of which only the point was left.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'It is as I feared,â€™ said Gandalf. 'These were no ordinary wolves<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hunting for food in the wilderness. Let us eat quickly and go!â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">That day the weather changed again, almost as if it was at the command<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of some power that had no longer any use for snow, since they had retreated<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">from the pass, a power that wished now to have a clear light in which things<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that moved in the wild could be seen from far away. The wind had been<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">turning through north to north-west during the night, and now it failed. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">clouds vanished southwards and the sky was opened, high and blue. As they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stood upon the hill-side, ready to depart, a pale sunlight gleamed over the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mountain-tops.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'We must reach the doors before sunset,â€™ said Gandalf, â€™or I fear we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shall not reach them at all. It is not far, but our path may be winding, for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">here Aragorn cannot guide us; he has seldom walked in this country, and only<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">once have I been under the west wall of Moria, and that was long ago.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'There it lies,â€™ he said, pointing away south-eastwards to where the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mountains' sides fell sheer into the shadows at their feet. In the distance<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">could be dimly seen a line of bare cliffs, and in their midst, taller than<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the rest, one great grey wall. 'When we left the pass I led you southwards,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and not back to our starting point, as some of you may have noticed. It is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">well that I did so, for now we have several miles less to cross, and haste<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">is needed. Let us go! '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I do not know which to hope,' said Boromir grimly: 'that Gandalf will<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">find what he seeks, or that coming to the cliff we shall find the gates lost<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">for ever. All choices seem ill, and to be caught between wolves and the wall<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the likeliest chance. Lead on!â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gimli now walked ahead by the wizardâ€™s side, so eager was he to come to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Moria. Together they led the Company back towards the mountains. The only<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">road of old to Moria from the west had lain along the course of a stream,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Sirannon, that ran out from the feet of the cliffs near where the doors<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">had stood. But either Gandalf was astray, or else the land had changed in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">recent years; for he did not strike the stream where he looked to find it,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">only a few miles southwards from their start.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The morning was passing towards noon, and still the Company wandered<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and scrambled in a barren country of red stones. Nowhere could they see any<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">gleam of water or hear any sound of it. All was bleak and dry. Their hearts<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sank. They saw no living thing, and not a bird was in the sky; but what the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">night would bring, if it caught them in that lost land, none of them cared<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to think.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Suddenly Gimli, who had pressed on ahead, called back to them. He was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">standing on a knoll and pointing to the right. Hurrying up they saw below<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">them a deep and narrow channel. It was empty and silent, and hardly a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">trickle of water flowed among the brown and red-stained stones of its bed;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">but on the near side there was a path, much broken and decayed, that wound<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">its way among the ruined walls and paving-stones of an ancient highroad.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™Ah! Here it is at last! ' said Gandalf. 'This is where the stream ran:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sirannon, the Gate-stream, they used to call it. But what has happened to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the water, I cannot guess; it used to be swift and noisy. Come! We must<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hurry on. We are late.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Company were footsore and tired; but they trudged doggedly along<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the rough and winding track for many miles. The sun turned from the noon and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">began to go west. After a brief halt and a hasty meal they went on again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Before them the mountains frowned, but their path lay in a deep trough of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">land and they could see only the higher shoulders and the far eastward<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">peaks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At length they came to a sharp bend. There the road, which had been<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">veering southwards between the brink of the channel and a steep fall of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">land to the left, turned and went due east again. Rounding the corner they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">saw before them a low cliff, some five fathoms high, with a broken and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">jagged top. Over it a trickling water dripped, through a wide cleft that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">seemed to have been carved out by a fall that had once been strong and full.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Indeed things have changed! ' said Gandalf. 'But there is no mistaking<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the place. There is all that remains of the Stair Falls. If I remember<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">right, there was a flight of steps cut in the rock at their side, but the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">main road wound away left and climbed with several loops up to the level<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ground at the top. There used to be a shallow valley beyond the falls right<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">up to the Walls of Moria, and the Sirannon flowed through it with the road<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">beside it. Let us go and see what things are like now ! '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They found the stone steps without difficulty, and Gimli sprang swiftly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">up them, followed by Gandalf and Frodo. When they reached the top they saw<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that they could go no further that way, and the reason for the drying up of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Gate-stream was revealed. Behind them the sinking Sun filled the cool<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">western sky with glimmering gold. Before them stretched a dark still lake.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Neither sky nor sunset was reflected on its sullen surface. The Sirannon had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">been dammed and had filled all the valley. Beyond the ominous water were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">reared vast cliffs, their stern faces pallid in the fading light: final and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">impassable. No sign of gate or entrance, not a fissure or crack could Frodo<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">see in the frowning stone.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'There are the Walls of Moria,' said Gandalf, pointing across the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">water. 'And there the Gate stood once upon a time, the Elven Door at the end<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of the road from Flollin by which we have come. But this way is blocked. None<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of the Company, I guess, will wish to swim this gloomy water at the end of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the day. It has an unwholesome look.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'We must find a way round the northern edge,' said Gimli. 'The first<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">thing for the Company to do is to climb up by the main path and see where<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that will lead us. Even if there were no lake, we could not get our<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">baggage-pony up this stair.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'But in any case we cannot take the poor beast into the Mines,â€™ said<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gandalf. 'The road under the mountains is a dark road, and there are places<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">narrow and steep which he cannot tread, even if we can.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Poor old Bill! ' said Frodo. 'I had not thought of that. And poor Sam!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I wonder what he will say? â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I am sorry,' said Gandalf. 'Poor Bill has been a useful companion and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it goes to my heart to turn him adrift now. I would have travelled lighter<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and brought no animal, least of all this one that Sam is fond of, if I had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">had my way. I feared all along that we should be obliged to take this road.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The day was drawing to its end, and cold stars were glinting in the sky<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">high above the sunset, when the Company, with all the speed they could,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">climbed up the slopes and reached the side of the lake. In breadth it looked<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to be no more than two or three furlongs at the widest point. How far it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stretched away southward they could not see in the failing light; but its<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">northern end was no more than half a mile from where they stood, and between<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the stony ridges that enclosed the valley and the water's edge there was a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">rim of open ground. They hurried forward, for they had still a mile or two<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to go before they could reach the point on the far shore that Gandalf was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">making for; and then he had still to find the doors.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">When they came to the northernmost corner of the lake they found a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">narrow creek that barred their way. It was green and stagnant, thrust out<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">like a slimy arm towards the enclosing hills. Gimli strode forward<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">undeterred, and found that the water was shallow, no more than ankle-deep at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the edge. Behind him they walked in file, threading their way with care, for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">under the weedy pools were sliding and greasy stones, and footing was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">treacherous. Frodo shuddered with disgust at the touch of the dark unclean<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">water on his feet.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As Sam, the last of the Company, led Bill up on to the dry ground on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the far side, there came a soft sound: a swish, followed by a plop, as if a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fish had disturbed the still surface of the water. Turning quickly they saw<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ripples, black-edged with shadow in the waning light: great rings were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">widening outwards from a point far out in the lake. There was a bubbling<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">noise, and then silence. The dusk deepened, and the last gleams of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sunset were veiled in cloud.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gandalf now pressed on at a great pace, and the others followed as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">quickly as they could. They reached the strip of dry land between the lake<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and the cliffs: it was narrow, often hardly a dozen yards across, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">encumbered with fallen rock and stones; but they found a way, hugging the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">cliff, and keeping as far from the dark water as they might. A mile<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">southwards along the shore they came upon holly trees. Stumps and dead<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">boughs were rotting in the shallows, the remains it seemed of old thickets,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">or of a hedge that had once lined the road across the drowned valley. But<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">close under the cliff there stood, still strong and living, . two tall<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">trees, larger than any trees of holly that Frodo had ever seen or imagined.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Their great roots spread from the wall to the water. Under the looming<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">cliffs they had looked like mere bushes, when seen far off from the top of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Stair; but now they towered overhead, stiff, dark, and silent, throwing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">deep night-shadows about their feet, standing like sentinel pillars at the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">end of the road.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well, here we are at last! 'said Gandalf. 'Here the Elven-way from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Hollin ended. Holly was the token of the people of that land, and they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">planted it here to mark the end of their domain; for the West -door was made<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">chiefly for their use in their traffic with the Lords of Moria. Those were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">happier days, when there was still close friendship at times between folk of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">different race, even between Dwarves and Elves.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'It was not the fault of the Dwarves that the friendship waned,' said<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gimli.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I have not heard that it was the fault of the Elves,' said Legolas.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I have heard both,' said Gandalf; 'and I will not give judgement now.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But I beg you two, Legolas and Gimli, at least to be friends, and to help<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">me. I need you both. The doors are shut and hidden, and the sooner we find<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">them the better. Night is at hand! '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Turning to the others he said: 'While I am searching, will you each<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">make ready to enter the Mines? For here I fear we must say farewell to our<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">good beast of burden. You must lay aside much of the stuff that we brought<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">against bitter weather: you will not need it inside, nor, I hope, when we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">come through and journey on down into the South. Instead each of us must<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">take a share of what the pony carried, especially the food and the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">water-skins.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'But you can't leave poor old Bill behind in this forsaken place, Mr.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gandalf! ' cried Sam, angry and distressed. 'I won't have it, and that's<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">flat. After he has come so far and all ! '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I am sorry, Sam,' said the wizard. 'But when the Door opens I do not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">think you will be able to drag your Bill inside, into the long dark of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Moria. You will have to choose between Bill and your master.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'He'd follow Mr. Frodo into a dragon's den, if I led him,' protested<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sam. 'It'd be nothing short of murder to turn him loose with all these<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wolves about.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'It will be short of murder, I hope,' said Gandalf. He laid his hand on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the pony's head, and spoke in a low voice. 'Go with words of guard and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">guiding on you,â€™ he said. 'You are a wise beast, and have learned much in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Rivendell. Make your ways to places where you can find grass, and so come in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">time to Elrond's house, or wherever you wish to go.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'There, Sam! He will have quite as much chance of escaping wolves and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">getting home as we have.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sam stood sullenly by the pony and returned no answer. Bill, seeming to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">understand well what was going on, nuzzled up to him, putting his nose to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sam's ear. Sam burst into tears, and fumbled with the straps, unlading all<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the pony's packs and throwing them on the ground. The others sorted out the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">goods, making a pile of all that could be left behind, and dividing up the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">rest.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">When this was done they turned to watch Gandalf. He appeared to have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">done nothing. He was standing between the two trees gazing at the blank wall<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of the cliff, as if he would bore a hole into it with his eyes. Gimli was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wandering about, tapping the stone here and there with his axe. Legolas was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">pressed against the rock, as if listening.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well, here we are and all ready,' said Merry; 'but where are the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Doors? I can't see any sign of them.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Dwarf-doors are not made to be seen when shut,' said Gimli. 'They are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">invisible, and their own masters cannot find them or open them, if their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">secret is forgotten.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'But this Door was not made to be a secret known only to Dwarves,' said<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gandalf, coming suddenly to life and turning round. 'Unless things are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">altogether changed, eyes that know what to look for may discover the signs.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He walked forward to the wall. Right between the shadow of the trees<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">there was a smooth space, and over this he passed his hands to and fro,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">muttering words under his breath. Then he stepped back.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Look!' he said. 'Can you see anything now?â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Moon now shone upon the grey face of the rock; but they could see<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">nothing else for a while. Then slowly on the surface, where the wizard's<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hands had passed, faint lines appeared, like slender veins of silver running<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in the stone. At first they were no more than pale gossamer-threads, so fine<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that they only twinkled fitfully where the Moon caught them, but steadily<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they grew broader and clearer, until their design could be guessed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At the top, as high as Gandalf could reach, was an arch of interlacing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">letters in an Elvish character. Below, though the threads were in places<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">blurred or broken, the outline could be seen of an anvil and a hammer<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">surmounted by a crown with seven stars. Beneath these again were two trees,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">each bearing crescent moons. More clearly than all else there shone forth in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the middle of the door a single star with many rays.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'There are the emblems of Dunn!' cried Gimli.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'And there is the Tree of the High Elves!' said Legolas.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'And the Star of the House of Flanor,' said Gandalf. 'They are wrought<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of ithildin that mirrors only starlight and moonlight, and sleeps until it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">is touched by one who speaks words now long forgotten in Middle-earth. It is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">long since I heard them, and I thought deeply before I could recall them to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">my mind.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™What does the writing say?â€™ asked Frodo, who was trying to decipher<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the inscription on the arch. â€™I thought I knew the elf-letters but I cannot<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">read these.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'The words are in the elven-tongue of the West of Middle-earth in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Elder Days,â€™ answered Gandalf. â€™But they do not say anything of importance<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to us. They say only: The Doors ofDurin, Lord ofMoria. Speak, friend, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">enter. And underneath small and faint is written: I, Narvi, made them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Celebrimbor ofHollin drew these signs.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'What does it mean by speak, friend, and enter!' asked Merry.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™That is plain enough,â€™ said Gimli. 'If you are a friend, speak the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">password, and the doors will open, and you can enter.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™Yes,' said Gandalf, 'these doors are probably governed by words. Some<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dwarf-gates will open only at special times, or for particular persons; and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">some have locks and keys that are still needed when all necessary times and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">words are known. These doors have no key. In the days of Durin they were not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">secret. They usually stood open and doorwards sat here. But if they were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shut, any who knew the opening word could speak it and pass in. At least so<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it is recorded, is it not, Gimli? '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'It is,' said the dwarf. 'But what the word was is not remembered.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Narvi and his craft and all his kindred have vanished from the earth.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™But do not you know the word, Gandalf? â€™ asked Boromir in surprise.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'No! â€™ said the wizard.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The others looked dismayed; only Aragorn, who knew Gandalf well,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">remained silent and unmoved.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™Then what was the use of bringing us to this accursed spot?â€™ cried<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Boromir, glancing back with a shudder at the dark water. 'You told us that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'The answer to your first question, Boromir,â€™ said the wizard, 'is that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I do not know the word-yet. But we shall soon see. And,â€™ he added, with a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">glint in his eyes under their bristling brows, 'you may ask what is the use<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">doubt my tale? Or have you no wits left? I did not enter this way. I came<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">from the East.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'If you wish to know, I will tell you that these doors open outwards.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">From the inside you may thrust them open with your hands. From the outside<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">nothing will move them save the spell of command. They cannot be forced<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'What are you going to do then? â€™ asked Pippin, undaunted by the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wizard's bristling brows.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Knock on the doors with your head, Peregrin Took,' said Gandalf. 'But<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">if that does not shatter them, and I am allowed a little peace from foolish<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">questions, I will seek for the opening words.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I once knew every spell in all the tongues of Elves or Men or Ores<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that was ever used for such a purpose. I can still remember ten score of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">them without searching in my mind. But only a few trials, I think, will be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">needed; and I shall not have to call on Gimli for words of the secret<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dwarf-tongue that they teach to none. The opening words were Elvish, like<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the writing on the arch: that seems certain.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Ele stepped up to the rock again, and lightly touched with his staff the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">silver star in the middle beneath the sign of the anvil.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Annon edhellen, edro hi ammen!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Fennas nogothrim, lasto beth lammen!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he said in a commanding voice. The silver lines faded, but the blank<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">grey stone did not stir.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Many times he repeated these words in different order, or varied them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Then he tried other spells, one after another, speaking now faster and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">louder, now soft and slow. Then he spoke many single words of Elvish speech.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Nothing happened. The cliff towered into the night, the countless stars were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">kindled, the wind blew cold, and the doors stood fast.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Again Gandalf approached the wall, and lifting up his arms he spoke in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">tones of command and rising wrath. Edro, edro! he cried, and struck the rock<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with his staff. Open, open! he shouted, and followed it with the same<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">command in every language that had ever been spoken in the West of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Middle-earth. Then he threw his staff on the ground, and sat down in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">silence.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At that moment from far off the wind bore to their listening ears the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">howling of wolves. Bill the pony started in fear, and Sam sprang to his side<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and whispered softly to him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Do not let him run away! ' said Boromir. 'It seems that we shall need<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">him still, if the wolves do not find us. How I hate this foul pool! ' He<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stooped and picking up a large stone he cast it far into the dark water.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The stone vanished with a soft slap; but at the same instant there was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a swish and a bubble. Great rippling rings formed on the surface out beyond<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">where the stone had fallen, and they moved slowly towards the foot of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">cliff.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™Why did you do that, Boromir? ' said Frodo. V I hate this place, too,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and I am afraid. I don't know of what: not of wolves, or the dark behind the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">doors, but of something else. I am afraid of the pool. Don't disturb it! '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'1 wish we could get away! ' said Merry.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Why doesn't Gandalf do something quick? ' said Pippin.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gandalf took no notice of them. He sat with his head bowed, either in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">despair or in anxious thought. The mournful howling of the wolves was heard<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">again. The ripples on the water grew and came closer; some were already<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">lapping on the shore.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">With a suddenness that startled them all the wizard sprang to his feet.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He was laughing! V I have it! ' he cried. 'Of course, of course! Absurdly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">simple, like most riddles when you see the answer.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Picking up his staff he stood before the rock and said in a clear<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">voice: Mellon!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The star shone out briefly and faded again. Then silently a great<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">doorway was outlined, though not a crack or joint had been visible before.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Slowly it divided in the middle and swung outwards inch by inch, until both<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">doors lay back against the wall. Through the opening a shadowy stair could<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">be seen climbing steeply up; but beyond the lower steps the darkness was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">deeper than the night. The Company stared in wonder.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">V I was wrong after all,' said Gandalf, 'and Gimli too. Merry, of all<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">people, was on the right track. The opening word was inscribed on the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">archway all the time! The translation should have been: Say "Friend" and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">enter. I had only to speak the Elvish word for friend and the doors opened.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Quite simple. Too simple for a learned lore-master in these suspicious days.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Those were happier times. Now let us go!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He strode forward and set his foot on the lowest step. But at that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">moment several things happened. Frodo felt something seize him by the ankle,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and he fell with a cry. Bill the pony gave a wild neigh of fear, and turned<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">tail and dashed away along the lakeside into the darkness. Sam leaped after<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">him, and then hearing Frodoâ€™s cry he ran back again, weeping and cursing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The others swung round and saw the waters of the lake seething, as if a host<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of snakes were swimming up from the southern end.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Out from the water a long sinuous tentacle had crawled; it was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">pale-green and luminous and wet. Its fingered end had hold of Frodo's foot<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and was dragging him into the water. Sam on his knees was now slashing at it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with a knife.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The arm let go of Frodo, and Sam pulled him away, crying out for help.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Twenty others arms came rippling out. The dark water boiled, and there was a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hideous stench.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Into the gateway! Up the stairs! Quick! ' shouted Gandalf leaping<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">back. Rousing them from the horror that seemed to have rooted all but Sam to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the ground where they stood, he drove them forward.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They were just in time. Sam and Frodo were only a few steps up, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gandalf had just begun to climb, when the groping tentacles writhed across<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the narrow shore and fingered the cliff- wall and the doors. One came<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wriggling over the threshold, glistening in the starlight. Gandalf turned<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and paused. If he was considering what word would close the gate again from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">within, there was no need. Many coiling arms seized the doors on either<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">side, and with horrible strength, swung them round. With a shattering echo<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they slammed, and all light was lost. A noise of rending and crashing came<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dully through the ponderous stone.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sam, clinging to Frodoâ€™s arm, collapsed on a step in the black<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">darkness. 'Poor old Bill! â€™ he said in a choking voice. 'Poor old Bill!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Wolves and snakes! But the snakes were too much for him. I had to choose,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mr. Frodo. I had to come with you.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They heard Gandalf go back down the steps and thrust his staff against<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the doors. There was a quiver in the stone and the stairs trembled, .but the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">doors did not open. 'Well, well! â€™ said the wizard. 'The passage is blocked<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">behind us now and there is only one way outâ€” on the other side of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mountains. I fear from the sounds that boulders have been piled up, and the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">trees uprooted and thrown across the gate. I am sorry; for the trees were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">beautiful, and had stood so long.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I felt that something horrible was near from the moment that my foot<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">first touched the water,' said Frodo. 'What was the thing, or were there<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">many of them? '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I do not know,' answered Gandalf, 'but the arms were all guided by one<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">purpose. Something has crept, or has been driven out of dark waters under<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the mountains. There are older and fouler things than Ores in the deep<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">places of the world.' He did not speak aloud his thought that whatever it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was that dwelt in the lake, it had seized on Frodo first among all the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Company.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Boromir muttered under his breath, but the echoing stone magnified the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sound to a hoarse whisper that all could hear: 'In the deep places of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">world! And thither we are going against my wish. Who will lead us nowin<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">this deadly dark? '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I will,' said Gandalf, 'and Gimli shall walk with me. Follow my staff!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">t<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As the wizard passed on ahead up the great steps, he held his staff<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">aloft, and from its tip there came a faint radiance. The wide stairway was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sound and undamaged. Two hundred steps they counted, broad and shallow;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">at the top they found an arched passage with a level floor leading on into<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the dark.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Let us sit and rest and have something to eat, here on the landing,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">since we can't find a dining-room! ' said Frodo. He had begun to shake off<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the terror of the clutching arm, and suddenly he felt extremely hungry.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The proposal was welcomed by all; and they sat down on the upper steps,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dim figures in the gloom. After they had eaten, Gandalf gave them each a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">third sip of the miruvor of Rivendell.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'It will not last much longer, I am afraid,â€™ he said; 'but I think we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">need it after that horror at the gate. And unless we have great luck, we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shall need all that is left before we see the other side! Go carefully with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the water, too! There are many streams and wells in the Mines, but they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">should not be touched. We may not have a chance of filling our skins and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">bottles till we come down into Dimrill Dale.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'How long is that going to take us? ' asked Frodo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I cannot say,' answered Gandalf. 'It depends on many chances. But<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">going straight, without mishap or losing our way, we shall take three or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">four marches, I expect. It cannot be less than forty miles from West -door to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After only a brief rest they started on their way again. All were eager<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to get the journey over as quickly as possible, and were willing, tired as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they were, to go on marching still for several hours. Gandalf walked in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">front as before. In his left hand he held up his glimmering staff, the light<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of which just showed the ground before his feet; in his right he held his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sword Glamdring. Behind him came Gimli, his eyes glinting in the dim light<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">as he turned his head from side to side. Behind the dwarf walked Frodo, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he had drawn the short sword, Sting. No gleam came from the blades of Sting<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">or of Glamdring; and that was some comfort, for being the work of Elvish<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">smiths in the Elder Days these swords shone with a cold light, if any Ores<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were near at hand. Behind Frodo went Sam, and after him Legolas, and the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">young hobbits, and Boromir. In the dark at the rear, grim and silent, walked<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Aragorn.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The passage twisted round a few turns, and then began to descend. It<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">went steadily down for a long while before it became level once again. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">air grew hot and stifling, but it was not foul, and at times they felt<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">currents of cooler air upon their faces, issuing from half-guessed openings<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in the walls. There were many of these. In the pale ray of the wizard's<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">staff, Frodo caught glimpses of stairs and arches and of other passages and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">tunnels, sloping up, or running steeply down, or opening blankly dark on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">either side. It was bewildering beyond hope of remembering.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gimli aided Gandalf very little, except by his stout courage. At least<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he was not, as were most of the others, troubled by the mere darkness in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">itself. Often the wizard consulted him at points where the choice of way was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">doubtful; but it was always Gandalf who had the final word. The Mines of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Moria were vast and intricate beyond the imagination of Gimli, Gluin's son,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dwarf of the mountain-race though he was. To Gandalf the far-off memories of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a journey long before were now of little help, but even in the gloom and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">despite all windings of the road he knew whither he wished to go, and he did<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">not falter, as long as there was a path that led towards his goal.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Do not be afraid! ' said Aragorn. There was a pause longer than usual,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and Gandalf and Gimli were whispering together; the others were crowded<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">behind, waiting anxiously. 'Do not be afraid! I have been with him on many a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">journey, if never on one so dark; and there are tales of Rivendell of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">greater deeds of his than any that I have seen. He will not go astray-if<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">there is any path to find. He has led us in here against our fears, but he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">will lead us out again, at whatever cost to himself. He is surer of finding<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the way home in a blind night than the cats of Queen BerÂ®thiel.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It was well for the Company that they had such a guide. They had no<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fuel nor any means of making torches; in the desperate scramble at the doors<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">many things had been left behind. But without any light they would soon have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">come to grief. There were not only many roads to choose from, there were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">also in many places holes and pitfalls, and dark wells beside the path in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">which their passing feet echoed. There were fissures and chasms in the walls<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and floor, and every now and then a crack would open right before their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">feet. The widest was more than seven feet across, and it was long before<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Pippin could summon enough courage to leap over the dreadful gap. The noise<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of churning water came up from far below, as if some great mill-wheel was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">turning in the depths.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Rope! ' muttered Sam. 'I knew I'd want it, if I hadn't got it! '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As these dangers became more frequent their march became slower.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Already they seemed to have been tramping on, on, endlessly to the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mountains' roots. They were more than weary, and yet there seemed no comfort<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in the thought of halting anywhere. Frodo's spirits had risen for a while<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">after his escape, and after food and a draught of the cordial; but now a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">deep uneasiness, growing to dread, crept over him again. Though he had been<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">healed in Rivendell of the knife-stroke, that grim wound had not been<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">without effect. His senses were sharper and more aware of things that could<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">not be seen. One sign of change that he soon had noticed was that he could<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">see more in the dark than any of his companions, save perhaps Gandalf. And<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he was in any case the bearer of the Ring: it hung upon its chain against<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his breast, and at whiles it seemed a heavy weight. He felt the certainty of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">evil ahead and of evil following; but he said nothing. He gripped tighter on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the hilt of his sword and went on doggedly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Company behind him spoke seldom, and then only in hurried whispers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There was no sound but the sound of their own feet; the dull stump of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gimli's dwarf-boots; the heavy tread of Boromir; the light step of Legolas;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the soft, scarce-heard patter of hobbit-feet; and in the rear the slow firm<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">footfalls of Aragorn with his long stride. When they halted for a moment<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they heard nothing at all, unless it were occasionally a faint trickle and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">drip of unseen water. Yet Frodo began to hear, or to imagine that he heard,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">something else: like the faint fall of soft bare feet. It was never loud<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">enough, or near enough, for him to feel certain that he heard it; but once<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it had started it never stopped, while the Company was moving. But it was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">not an echo, for when they halted it pattered on for a little all by itself,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and then grew still.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It was after nightfall when they had entered the Mines. They had been<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">going for several hours with only brief halts, when Gandalf came to his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">first serious check. Before him stood a wide dark arch opening into three<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">passages: all led in the same general direction, eastwards; but the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">left-hand passage plunged down, while the right-hand climbed up, and the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">middle way seemed to run on, smooth and level but very narrow.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I have no memory of this place at all!' said Gandalf, standing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">uncertainly under the arch. He held up his staff in the hope of finding some<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">marks or inscription that might help his choice; but nothing of the kind was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to be seen. I am too weary to decide,' he said, shaking his head. 'And I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">expect that you are all as weary as I am, or wearier. We had better halt<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">here for what is left of the night. You know what I mean! In here it is ever<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dark; but outside the late Moon is riding westward and the middle-night has<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">passed.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Poor old Bill! ' said Sam. 'I wonder where he is. I hope those wolves<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">haven't got him yet.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">To the left of the great arch they found a stone door: it was half<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">closed, but swung back easily to a gentle thrust. Beyond there seemed to lie<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a wide chamber cut in the rock.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Steady! Steady! ' cried Gandalf as Merry and Pippin pushed forward,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">glad to find a place where they could rest with at least more feeling of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shelter than in the open passage. 'Steady! You do not know what is inside<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">yet. I will go first.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He went in cautiously, and the others filed behind. 'There! â€™ he said,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">pointing with his staff to the middle of the floor. Before his feet they saw<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a large round hole like the mouth of a well. Broken and rusty chains lay at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the edge and trailed down into the black pit. Fragments of stone lay near.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'One of you might have fallen in and still be wondering when you were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">going to strike the bottom,' said Aragorn to Merry. 'Let the guide go first<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">while you have one.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'This seems to have been a guardroom, made for the watching of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">three passages,' said Gimli. 'That hole was plainly a well for the guards'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">use, covered with a stone lid. But the lid is broken, and we must all take<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">care in the dark.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Pippin felt curiously attracted by the well. While the others were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">unrolling blankets and making beds against the walls of the chamber, as far<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">as possible from the hole in the floor, he crept to the edge and peered<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">over. A chill air seemed to strike his face, rising from invisible depths.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Moved by a sudden impulse he groped for a loose stone, and let it drop. He<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">felt his heart beat many times before there was any sound. Then far below,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">as if the stone had fallen into deep water in some cavernous place, there<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">came a plunk , very distant, but magnified and repeated in the hollow shaft.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'What's that? ' cried Gandalf. He was relieved when Pippin confessed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">what he had done; but he was angry, and Pippin could see his eye glinting.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™Fool of a Took! ' he growled. 'This is a serious journey, not a hobbit<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">walking -party. Throw yourself in next time, and then you will be no further<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">nuisance. Now be quiet! '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Nothing more was heard for several minutes; but then there came out of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the depths faint knocks: tom-tap, tap-tom. They stopped, and when the echoes<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">had died away, they were repeated: tap-tom, tom-tap, tap-tap, tom. They<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sounded disquietingly like signals of some sort; but after a while the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">knocking died away and was not heard again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'That was the sound of a hammer, or I have never heard one,' said<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gimli.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Yes,' said Gandalf, 'and I do not like it. It may have nothing to do<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with Peregrin's foolish stone; but probably something has been disturbed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that would have been better left quiet. Pray, do nothing of the kind again!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Let us hope we shall get some rest without further trouble. You, Pippin, can<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">go on the first watch, as a reward,' he growled, as he rolled himself in a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">blanket.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Pippin sat miserably by the door in the pitch dark; but he kept on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">turning round, fearing that some unknown thing would crawl up out of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">well. He wished he could cover the hole, if only with a blanket, but he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dared not move or go near it, even though Gandalf seemed to be asleep.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Actually Gandalf was awake, though lying still and silent. He was deep<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in thought, trying to recall every memory of his former journey in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mines, and considering anxiously the next course that he should take; a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">false turn now might be disastrous. After an hour he rose up and came over<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to Pippin.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Get into a corner and have a sleep, my lad,' he said in a kindly tone.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You want to sleep, I expect. I cannot get a wink, so I may as well do the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">watching.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I know what is the matter with me,' he muttered, as he sat down by the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">door. 'I need smoke ! I have not tasted it since the morning before the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">snowstorm.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The last thing that Pippin saw, as sleep took him, was a dark glimpse<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of the old wizard huddled on the floor, shielding a glowing chip in his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">gnarled hands between his knees. The flicker for a moment showed his sharp<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">nose, and the puff of smoke.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It was Gandalf who roused them all from sleep. He had sat and watched<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">all alone for about six hours, and had let the others rest. 'And in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">watches I have made up my mind,' he said. 'I do not like the feel of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">middle way; and I do not like the smell of the left-hand way: there is foul<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">air down there, or I am no guide. I shall take the right-hand passage. It is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">time we began to climb up again.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For eight dark hours, not counting two brief halts, they marched on;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and they met no danger, and heard nothing, and saw nothing but the faint<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">gleam of the wizard's light, bobbing like a will-o'-the-wisp in front of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">them. The passage they had chosen wound steadily upwards. As far as they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">could judge it went in great mounting curves, and as it rose it grew loftier<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and wider. There were now no openings to other galleries or tunnels on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">either side, and the floor was level and sound, without pits or cracks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Evidently they had struck what once had been an important road; and they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">went forward quicker than they had done on their first march.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In this way they advanced some fifteen miles, measured in a direct line<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">east, though they must have actually walked twenty miles or more. As the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">road climbed upwards' Frodo's spirits rose a little; but he still felt<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">oppressed, and still at times he heard, or thought he heard, away behind the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Company and beyond the fall and patter of their feet, a following footstep<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that was not an echo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They had marched as far as the hobbits could endure without a rest, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">all were thinking of a place where they could sleep, when suddenly the walls<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to right and left vanished. They seemed to have passed through some arched<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">doorway into a black and empty space. There was a great draught of warmer<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">air behind them, and before them the darkness was cold on their faces. They<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">halted and crowded anxiously together.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gandalf seemed pleased. 'I chose the right way,' he said. 'At last we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">are coming to the habitable parts, and I guess that we are not far now from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the eastern side. But we are high up, a good deal higher than the Dimrill<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gate, unless I am mistaken. From the feeling of the air we must be in a wide<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hall. I will now risk a little real light.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He raised his staff, and for a brief instant there was blaze like a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">flash of lightning. Great shadows sprang up and fled, and for a second they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">saw a vast roof far above their heads upheld by many mighty pillars hewn of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stone. Before them and on either side stretched a huge empty hall; its black<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">walls, polished and smooth as glass, flashed and glittered. Three other<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">entrances they saw, dark black arches: one straight before them eastwards,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and one on either side. Then the light went out.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'That is all that I shall venture on for the present,' said Gandalf.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'There used to be great windows on the mountain-side, and shafts leading out<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">now, but it is night outside again, and we cannot tell until morning. If I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">am right, tomorrow we may actually see the morning peeping in. But in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">meanwhile we had better go no further. Let us rest, if we can. Things have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">gone well so far, and the greater part of the dark road is over. But we are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">not through yet, and it is a long way down to the Gates that open on the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Company spent that night in the great cavernous hall, huddled close<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">together in a corner to escape the draught: there seemed to be a steady<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">inflow of chill air through the eastern archway. All about them as they lay<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hung the darkness, hollow and immense, and they were oppressed by the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">loneliness and vastness of the dolven halls and endlessly branching stairs<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and passages. The wildest imaginings that dark rumour had ever suggested to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the hobbits fell altogether short of the actual dread and wonder of Moria.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'There must have been a mighty crowd of dwarves here at one time ' said<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sam; 'and every one of them busier than badgers for five hundred years to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">didn't live in these darksome holes surely? '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'These are not holes,â€™ said Gimli. 'This is the great realm and city of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Dwarrowdelf. And of old it was not darksome, but full of light and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">splendour, as is still remembered in our songs.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He rose and standing in the dark he began to chant in a deep voice,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">while the echoes ran away into the roof.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The world was young, the mountains green,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">No words were laid on stream or stone<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He named the nameless hills and dells;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He stooped and looked in Mirrormere,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And saw a crown of stars appear,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As gems upon a silver thread,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mathom-house, I suppose.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'What? ' cried Gimli, startled out of his silence. 'A corslet of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Moria- silver? That was a kingly gift! â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Yes,' said Gandalf. I never told him, but its worth was greater than<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the value of the whole Shire and everything in it.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo said nothing, but he put his hand under his tunic and touched the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">rings of his mail-shirt. He felt staggered to think that he had been walking<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">about with the price of the Shire under his jacket. Had Bilbo known? He felt<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">no doubt that Bilbo knew quite well. It was indeed a kingly gift. But now<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his thoughts had been carried away from the dark Mines, to Rivendell, to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Bilbo, and to Bag End in the days while Bilbo was still there. He wished<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with all his heart that he was back there, and in those days, mowing the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">lawn, or pottering among the flowers, and that he had never heard of Moria,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">or mithril â€” or the Ring.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A deep silence fell. One by one the others fell asleep. Frodo was on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">guard. As if it were a breath that came in through unseen doors out of deep<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">places, dread came over him. His hands were cold and his brow damp. He<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">listened. All his mind was given to listening and nothing else for two slow<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hours; but he heard no sound, not even the imagined echo of a footfall.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">His watch was nearly over, when, far off where he guessed that the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">western archway stood, he fancied that he could see two pale points of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">light, almost like luminous eyes. He started. His head had nodded. 'I must<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">have nearly fallen asleep on guard,' he thought. 'I was on the edge of a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dream.' He stood up and rubbed his eyes, and remained standing, peering into<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the dark, until he was relieved by Legolas.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">When he lay down he quickly went to sleep, but it seemed to him that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the dream went on: he heard whispers, and saw the two pale points of light<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">approaching, slowly. He woke and found that the others were speaking softly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">near him, and that a dim light was falling on his face. High up above the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">eastern archway through a shaft near the roof came a long pale gleam; and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">across the hall through the northern arch light also glimmered faint and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">distantly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo sat up. 'Good morning! 'said Gandalf: 'For morning it is again<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">at last. I was right, you see. We are high up on the east side of Moria.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Before today is over we ought to find the Great Gates and see the waters of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mirrormere lying in the Dimrill Dale before us.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I shall be glad,' said Gimli. 'I have looked on Moria, and it is very<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">great, but it has become dark and dreadful; and we have found no sign of my<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">kindred. I doubt now that Balin ever came here.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After they had breakfasted Gandalf decided to go on again at once. 'We<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">are tired, but we shall rest better when we are outside,â€™ he said. 'I think<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that none of us will wish to spend another night in Moria.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'No indeed! â€™ said Boromir. 'Which way shall we take? Yonder eastward<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">arch? â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™Maybe,â€™ said Gandalf. 'But I du not know yet exactly where we are.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Unless I am quite astray, I guess that we are above and to the north of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Great Gates; and it may not be easy to find the right road down to them. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">eastern arch will probably prove to be the way that we must take; but before<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">we make up our minds we ought to look about us. Let us go towards that light<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in the north door. If we could find a window it would help, but I fear that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the light comes only down deep shafts.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Following his lead the Company passed under the northern arch. They<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">found themselves in a wide corridor. As they went along it the glimmer grew<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stronger, and they saw that it came through a doorway on their right. It was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">high and flat-topped, and the stone door was still upon its hinges, standing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">half open. Beyond it was a large square chamber. It was dimly lit, but to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">their eyes, after so long a time in the dark, it seemed dazzlingly bright,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and they blinked as they entered.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Their feet disturbed a deep dust upon the floor, and stumbled among<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">things lying in the doorway whose shapes they could not at first make out.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The chamber was lit by a wide shaft high in the further eastern wall; it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">slanted upwards and, far above, a small square patch of blue sky could be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">seen. The light of the shaft fell directly on a table in the middle of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">room: a single oblong block, about two feet high, upon which was laid a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">great slab of white stone.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'It looks like a tomb,â€™ muttered Frodo, and bent forwards with a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">curious sense of foreboding, to look more closely at it. Gandalf came<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">quickly to his side. On the slab runes were deeply graven:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">These are Daeron's Runes, such as were used of old in Moria,' said<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gandalf. 'Here is written in the tongues of Men and Dwarves:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'He is dead then,' said Frodo. T feared it was so.' Gimli cast his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Company of the Ring stood silent beside the tomb of Balin. Frodo<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">thought of Bilbo and his long friendship with the dwarf, and of Balin's<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">visit to the Shire long ago. In that dusty chamber in the mountains it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">seemed a thousand years ago and on the other side of the world.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At length they stirred and looked up, and began to search for anything<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that would give them tidings of Balin's fate, or show what had become of his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">folk. There was another smaller door on the other side of the chamber, under<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the shaft. By both the doors they could now see that many bones were lying,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and among them were broken swords and axe-heads, and cloven shields and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">helms. Some of the swords were crooked: ore-scimitars with blackened blades.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There were many recesses cut in the rock of the walls, and in them were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">large iron-bound chests of wood. All had been broken and plundered; but<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">beside the shattered lid of one there lay the remains of a book. It had been<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">slashed and stabbed and partly burned, and it was so stained with black and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">other dark marks like old blood that little of it could be read. Gandalf<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">lifted it carefully, but the leaves crackled and broke as he laid it on the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">slab. He pored over it for some time without speaking. Frodo and Gimli<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">standing at his side could see, as he gingerly turned the leaves, that they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were written by many different hands, in runes, both of Moria and of Dale,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and here and there in Elvish script.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At last Gandalf looked up. 'It seems to be a record of the fortunes of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Balin's folk,' he said. V I guess that it began with their coming to Dimrill<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Dale nigh on thirty years ago: the pages seem to have numbers referring to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">out. The end comes, and then drums, drums in the deep. I wonder what that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">means. The last thing written is in a trailing scrawl of elf-letters: they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">are coming. There is nothing more.' Gandalf paused and stood in silent<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">thought.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A sudden dread and a horror of the chamber fell on the Company. ' We<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">cannot get out,' muttered Gimli. 'It was well for us that the pool had sunk<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a little, and that the Watcher was sleeping down at the southern end.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gandalf raised his head and looked round. 'They seem to have made a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">last stand by both doors,' he said; 'but there were not many left by that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">time. So ended the attempt to retake Moria! It was valiant but foolish. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">time is not come yet. Now, I fear, we must say farewell to Balin son of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Fundin. Here he must lie in the halls of his fathers. We will take this<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">book, the Book of Mazarbul, and look at it more closely later. You had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">better keep it, Gimli, and take it back to Dbin, if you get a chance. It<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">will interest him, though it will grieve him deeply. Come, let us go! The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">morning is passing.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Which way shall we go? ' asked Boromir.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Back to the hall,' answered Gandalf. 'But our visit to this room has<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">not been in vain. I now know where we are. This must be, as Gimli says, the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Chamber of Mazarbul; and the hall must be the twenty-first of the North-end.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Therefore we should leave by the eastern arch of the hall, and bear right<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and south, and go downwards. The Twenty-first Hall should be on the Seventh<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Level, that is six above the level of the Gates. Come now! Back to the hall!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">f<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gandalf had hardly spoken these words, when there came a great noise: a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">rolling Boom that seemed to come from depths far below, and to tremble in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the stone at their feet. They sprang towards the door in alarm. Doom, doom<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it rolled again, as if huge hands were turning the very caverns of Moria<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">into a vast drum. Then there came an echoing blast: a great horn was blown<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in the hall, and answering horns and harsh cries were heard further off.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There was a hurrying sound of many feet.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'They are coming! â€™ cried Legolas.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'We cannot get out,' said Gimli.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Trapped! ' cried Gandalf. 'Why did I delay? Here we are, caught, just<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">as they were before. But I was not here then. We will see what â€” '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Doom, doom came the drum-beat and the walls shook.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Slam the doors and wedge them! ' shouted Aragorn. 'And keep your packs<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">on as long as you can: we may get a chance to cut our way out yet.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'No! ' said Gandalf. 'We must not get shut in. Keep the east door ajar!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">We will go that way, if we get a chance.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Another harsh horn-call and shrill cries rang out. Feet were coming<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">down the corridor. There was a ring and clatter as the Company drew their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">swords. Glamdring shone with a pale light, and Sting glinted at the edges.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Boromir set his shoulder against the western door.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Wait a moment! Do not close it yet! ' said Gandalf. He sprang forward<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to Boromir's side and drew himself up to his full height.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Who comes hither to disturb the rest of Balin Lord of Moria? ' he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">cried in a loud voice.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There was a rush of hoarse laughter, like the fall of sliding stones<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">into a pit; amid the clamour a deep voice was raised in command. Doom,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">boom,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">doom went the drums in the deep.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">With a quick movement Gandalf stepped before the narrow opening of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">door and thrust forward his staff: There was a dazzling flash that lit the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">chamber and the passage outside. For an instant the wizard looked out.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Arrows whined and whistled down the corridor as he sprang back.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'There are Ores, very many of them,' he said. 'And some are large and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">evil: black Uruks of Mordor. For the moment they are hanging back, but there<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">is something else there. A great cave-troll, I think, or more than one.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There is no hope of escape that way.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'And no hope at all, if they come at the other door as well,' said<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Boromir.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'There is no sound outside here yet,' said Aragorn, who was standing by<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the eastern door listening. 'The passage on this side plunges straight down<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a stair: it plainly does not lead back towards the hall. But it is no good<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">flying blindly this way with the pursuit just behind. We cannot block the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">door. Its key is gone and the lock is broken, and it opens inwards. We must<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">do something to delay the enemy first. We will make them fear the Chamber of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mazarbul!â€™ he said grimly feeling the edge of his sword, AndÂ®ril.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Heavy feet were heard in the corridor. Boromir flung himself against<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the door and heaved it to; then he wedged it with broken sword-blades and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">splinters of wood. The Company retreated to the other side of the chamber.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But they had no chance to fly yet. There was a blow on the door that made it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">quiver; and then it began to grind slowly open, driving back the wedges. A<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">huge arm and shoulder, with a dark skin of greenish scales, was thrust<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">through the widening gap. Then a great, flat, toeless foot was forced<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">through below. There was a dead silence outside.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Boromir leaped forward and hewed at the arm with all his might; but his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sword rang, glanced aside, and fell from his shaken hand. The blade was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">notched.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Suddenly, and to his own surprise, Frodo felt a hot wrath blaze up in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his heart. 'The Shire! ' he cried, and springing beside Boromir, he stooped,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and stabbed with Sting at the hideous foot. There was a bellow, and the foot<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">jerked back, nearly wrenching Sting from Frodo's arm. Black drops dripped<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">from the blade and smoked on the floor. Boromir hurled himself against the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">door and slammed it again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'One for the Shire! ' cried Aragorn. 'The hobbit's bite is deep! You<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">have a good blade, Frodo son of Drogo ! '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There was a crash on the door, followed by crash after crash. Rams and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hammers were beating against it. It cracked and staggered back, and the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">opening grew suddenly wide. Arrows came whistling in, but struck the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">northern wall, and fell harmlessly to the floor. There was a horn-blast and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a rush of feet, and ores one after another leaped into the chamber.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">How many there were the Company could not count. The affray was sharp,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">but the ores were dismayed by the fierceness of the defence. Legolas shot<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">two through the throat. Gimli hewed the legs from under another that had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sprung up on Balin' s tomb. Boromir and Aragorn slew many. When thirteen<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fallen the rest fled shrieking, leaving the defenders unharmed, except for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sam who had a scratch along the scalp. A quick duck had saved him; and he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">had felled his ore: a sturdy thrust with his Barrow-blade. A fire was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">smouldering in his brown eyes that would have made Ted Sandyman step<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">backwards, if he had seen it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Now is the time! ' cried Gandalf. 'Let us go, before the troll<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">returns!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But even as they retreated, and before Pippin and Merry had reached the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stair outside, a huge ore-chieftain, almost man-high, clad in black mail<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">from head to foot, leaped into the chamber; behind him his followers<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">clustered in the doorway. His broad flat face was swart, his eyes were like<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">coals, and his tongue was red; he wielded a great spear. With a thrust of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his huge hide shield he turned Boromir's sword and bore him backwards,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">throwing him to the ground. Diving under Aragorn's blow with the speed of a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">striking snake he charged into the Company and thrust with his spear<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">straight at Frodo. The blow caught him on the right side, and Frodo was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hurled against the wall and pinned. Sam, with a cry, hacked at the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">spear- shaft, and it broke. But even as the ore flung down the truncheon and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">swept out his scimitar, AndÂ®ril came down upon his helm. There was a flash<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">like flame and the helm burst asunder. The ore fell with cloven head. His<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">followers fled howling, as Boromir and Aragorn sprang at them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Doom, doom went the drums in the deep. The great voice rolled out<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Now! ' shouted Gandalf. 'Now is the last chance. Run for it! '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Aragorn picked up Frodo where he lay by the wall and made for the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stair, pushing Merry and Pippin in front of him. The others followed; but<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gimli had to be dragged away by Legolas: in spite of the peril he lingered<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">by Balin's tomb with his head bowed. Boromir hauled the eastern door to,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">grinding upon its hinges: it had great iron rings on either side, but could<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">not be fastened.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I am all right,' gasped Frodo. 'I can walk. Put me down! '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Aragorn nearly dropped him in his amazement. 'I thought you were dead!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">' he cried.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Not yet! ' said Gandalf. 'But there is time for wonder. Off you go,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">all of you, down the stairs! Wait a few minutes for me at the bottom, but if<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I do not come soon, go on! Go quickly and choose paths leading right and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">downwards.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'We cannot leave you to hold the door alone! ' said Aragorn.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Do as I say! ' said Gandalf fiercely. 'Swords are no more use here.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Go!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The passage was lit by no shaft and was utterly dark. They groped their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">way down a long flight of steps, and then looked back; but they could see<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">nothing, except high above them the faint glimmer of the wizard's staff. He<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">seemed to be still standing on guard by the closed door. Frodo breathed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">heavily and leaned against Sam, who put his arms about him. They stood<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">peering up the stairs into the darkness. Frodo thought he could hear the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">voice of Gandalf above, muttering words that ran down the sloping roof with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a sighing echo. He could not catch what was said. The walls seemed to be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">trembling. Every now and again the drum-beats throbbed and rolled: doom,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">doom.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Suddenly at the top of the stair there was a stab of white light. Then<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">there was a dull rumble and a heavy thud. The drum-beats broke out wildly:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">doom-boom, doom-boom, and then stopped. Gandalf came flying down the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">steps<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and fell to the ground in the midst of the Company.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well, well! That's over! ' said the wizard struggling to his feet. 'I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">have done all that I could. But I have met my match, and have nearly been<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">destroyed. But don't stand here! Go on! You will have to do without light<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">for a while: I am rather shaken. Go on! Go on! Where are you, Gimli? Come<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ahead with me! Keep close behind, all of you!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They stumbled after him wondering what had happened. Doom, doom<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">went<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the drum-beats again: they now sounded muffled and far away, but they were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">following. There was no other sound of pursuit, neither tramp of feet, nor<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">any voice. Gandalf took no turns, right or left, for the passage seemed to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">be going in the direction that he desired. Every now and again it descended<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a flight of steps, fifty or more, to a lower level. At the moment that was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">their chief danger; for in the dark they could not see a descent, until they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">came on it, and put their feet out into emptiness. Gandalf felt the ground<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with his staff like a blind man.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At the end of an hour they had gone a mile, or maybe a little more, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">had descended many flights of stairs. There was still no sound of pursuit.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Almost they began to hope that they would escape. At the bottom of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">seventh flight Gandalf halted.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'It is getting hot! ' he gasped. 'We ought to be down at least to the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">level of the Gates now. Soon I think we should look for a left-hand turn to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">take us east. I hope it is not far. I am very weary. I must rest here a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">moment, even if all the ores ever spawned are after us.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gimli took his arm and helped him down to a seat on the step. 'What<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">happened away up there at the door? â€™ he asked. 'Did you meet the beater of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the drums? â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™I do not know,' answered Gandalf. 'But I found myself suddenly faced<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">by something that I have not met before. I could think of nothing to do but<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to try and put a shutting -spell on the door. I know many; but to do things<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of that kind rightly requires time, and even then the door can be broken by<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">strength.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'As I stood there I could hear ore- voices on the other side: at any<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">moment I thought they would burst it open. I could not hear what was said;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they seemed to be talking in their own hideous language. All I caught was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ghvsh; that is "fire". Then something came into the chamber â€” I felt it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">through the door, and the ores themselves were afraid and fell silent. It<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">laid hold of the iron ring, and then it perceived me and my spell.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™What it was I cannot guess, but I have never felt such a challenge.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The counter-spell was terrible. It nearly broke me. For an instant the door<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">left my control and began to open ! I had to speak a word of Command. That<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">proved too great a strain. The door burst in pieces. Something dark as a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">cloud was blocking out all the light inside, and I was thrown backwards down<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the stairs. All the wall gave way, and the roof of the chamber as well, I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">think.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I am afraid Balin is buried deep, and maybe something else is buried<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">there too. I cannot say. But at least the passage behind us was completely<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">blocked. Ah! I have never felt so spent, but it is passing. And now what<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">about you, Frodo? There was not time to say so, but I have never been more<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">delighted in my life than when you spoke. I feared that it was a brave but<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dead hobbit that Aragorn was carrying.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'What about me? ' said Frodo. 'I am alive, and whole I think. I am<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">bruised and in pain, but it is not too bad.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well,' said Aragorn, 'I can only say that hobbits are made of a stuff<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">so tough that I have never met the like of it. Had I known, I would have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">spoken softer in the Inn at Bree! That spear -thrust would have skewered a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wild boar! â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™Well, it did not skewer me, I am glad to say,â€™ said Frodo; 'though I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">feel as if I had been caught between a hammer and an anvil.â€™ He said no<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">more. He found breathing painful.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™You take after Bilbo,â€™ said Gandalf. 'There is more about you than<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">meets the eye, as I said of him long ago.â€™ Frodo wondered if the remark<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">meant more than it said.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They now went on again. Before long Gimli spoke. He had keen eyes in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the dark. 'I think,â€™ he said, 'that there is a light ahead. But it is not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">daylight. It is red. What can it be? â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">' Ghvsh !' muttered Gandalf. 'I wonder if that is what they meant: that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the lower levels are on fire? Still, we can only go on.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Soon the light became unmistakable, and could be seen by all. It was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">flickering and glowing on the walls away down the passage before them. They<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">could now see their way: in front the road sloped down swiftly, and some way<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ahead there stood a low archway; through it the glowing light came. The air<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">became very hot.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">When they came to the arch Gandalf went through, signing to them to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wait. As he stood just beyond the opening they saw his face lit by a red<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">glow. Quickly he stepped back.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'There is some new devilry here,' he said, 'devised for our welcome no<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">doubt. But I know now where we are: we have reached the First Deep, the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">level immediately below the Gates. This is the Second Hall of Old Moria; and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Gates are near: away beyond the eastern end, on the left, not more than<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a quarter of a mile. Across the Bridge, up a broad stair, along a wide road<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">through the First Hall, and out! But come and look! '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They peered out. Before them was another cavernous hall. It was loftier<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and far longer than the one in which they had slept. They were near its<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">eastern end; westward it ran away into darkness. Down the centre stalked a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">double line of towering pillars. They were carved like boles of mighty trees<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">whose boughs upheld the roof with a branching tracery of stone. Their stems<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were smooth and black, but a red glow was darkly mirrored in their sides.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Right across the floor, close to the feet of two huge pillars a great<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fissure had opened. Out of it a fierce red light came, and now and again<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">flames licked at the brink and curled about the bases of the columns. Wisps<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of dark smoke wavered in the hot air.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'If we had come by the main road down from the upper halls, we should<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">have been trapped here,' said Gandalf. 'Let us hope that the fire now lies<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">between us and pursuit. Come! There is no time to lose.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Even as he spoke they heard again the pursuing drum-beat: Doom, doom,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">doom. Away beyond the shadows at the western end of the hall there came<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">cries and horn-calls. Doom, doom : the pillars seemed to tremble and the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">flames to quiver.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Now for the last race! â€™ said Gandalf. 'If the sun is shining outside<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">we may still escape. After me! '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He turned left and sped across the smooth floor of the hall. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">distance was greater than it had looked. As they ran they heard the beat and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">echo of many hurrying feet behind. A shrill yell went up: they had been<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">seen. There was a ring and clash of steel. An arrow whistled over Frodo's<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">head.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Boromir laughed. 'They did not expect this,â€™ he said. 'The fire has cut<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">them off. We are on the wrong side! â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Look ahead! ' called Gandalf. 'The Bridge is near. It is dangerous and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">narrow.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Suddenly Frodo saw before him a black chasm. At the end of the hall the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">floor vanished and fell to an unknown depth. The outer door could only be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">reached by a slender bridge of stone, without kerb or rail, that spanned the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">chasm with one curving spring of fifty feet. It was an ancient defence of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Dwarves against any enemy that might capture the First Hall and the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">outer passages. They could only pass across it in single file. At the brink<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gandalf halted and the others came up in a pack behind.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Lead the way, Gimli! ' he said. 'Pippin and Merry next. Straight on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and up the stair beyond the door! '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Arrows fell among them. One struck Frodo and sprang back. Another<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">pierced Gandalf s hat and stuck there like a black feather. Frodo looked<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">behind. Beyond the fire he saw swarming black figures: there seemed to be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hundreds of ores. They brandished spears and scimitars which shone red as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">blood in the firelight. Doom, doom rolled the drum-beats, growing louder and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">louder, doom, doom.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Legolas turned and set an arrow to the string, though it was a long<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shot for his small bow. He drew, but his hand fell, and the arrow slipped to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the ground. He gave a cry of dismay and fear. Two great trolls appeared;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they bore great slabs of stone, and flung them down to serve as gangways<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">over the fire. But it was not the trolls that had filled the Elf with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">terror. The ranks of the ores had opened, and they crowded away, as if they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">themselves were afraid. Something was coming up behind them. What it was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">could not be seen: it was like a great shadow, in the middle of which was a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dark form, of man-shape maybe, yet greater; and a power and terror seemed to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">be in it and to go before it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It came to the edge of the fire and the light faded as if a cloud had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">bent over it. Then with a rush it leaped across the fissure. The flames<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">roared up to greet it, and wreathed about it; and a black smoke swirled in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the air. Its streaming mane kindled, and blazed behind it. In its right hand<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was a blade like a stabbing tongue of fire; in its left it held a whip of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">many thongs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Ai! ai! ' wailed Legolas. 'A Balrog! A Balrog is come! '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gimli stared with wide eyes. 'Durin's Bane! ' he cried, and letting his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">axe fall he covered his face.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'A Balrog,' muttered Gandalf. 'Now I understand.' He faltered and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">leaned heavily on his staff. 'What an evil fortune! And I am already weary.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The dark figure streaming with fire raced towards them. The ores yelled<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and poured over the stone gangways. Then Boromir raised his horn and blew.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Loud the challenge rang and bellowed, like the shout of many throats under<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the cavernous roof. For a moment the ores quailed and the fiery shadow<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">halted. Then the echoes died as suddenly as a flame blown out by a dark<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wind, and the enemy advanced again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Over the bridge!' cried Gandalf, recalling his strength. "Fly ! This is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a foe beyond any of you. I must hold the narrow way. Fly! ' Aragorn and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Boromir did not heed the command, but still held their ground, side by side,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">behind Gandalf at the far end of the bridge. The others halted just within<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the doorway at the hall's end, and turned, unable to leave their leader to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">face the enemy alone.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Balrog reached the bridge. Gandalf stood in the middle of the span,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">leaning on the staff in his left hand, but in his other hand Glamdring<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">gleamed, cold and white. His enemy halted again, facing him, and the shadow<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">about it reached out like two vast wings. It raised the whip, and the thongs<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">whined and cracked. Fire came from its nostrils. But Gandalf stood firm.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You cannot pass,' he said. The ores stood still, and a dead silence<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fell. V I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor. You<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">cannot pass. The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udyn. Go back to the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Shadow! You cannot pass.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Balrog made no answer. The fire in it seemed to die, but the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">darkness grew. It stepped forward slowly on to the bridge, and suddenly it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">drew itself up to a great height, and its wings were spread from wall to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wall; but still Gandalf could be seen, glimmering in the gloom; he seemed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">small, and altogether alone: grey and bent, like a wizened tree before the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">onset of a storm.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">From out of the shadow a red sword leaped flaming.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Glamdring glittered white in answer.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There was a ringing clash and a stab of white fire. The Balrog fell<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">back and its sword flew up in molten fragments. The wizard swayed on the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">bridge, stepped back a pace, and then again stood still.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You cannot pass! ' he said.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">With a bound the Balrog leaped full upon the bridge. Its whip whirled<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and hissed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'He cannot stand alone! ' cried Aragorn suddenly and ran back along the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">bridge. 'Elendil!' he shouted. 'I am with you, Gandalf! '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Gondor! ' cried Boromir and leaped after him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At that moment Gandalf lifted his staff, and crying aloud he smote the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">bridge before him. The staff broke asunder and fell from his hand. A<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">blinding sheet of white flame sprang up. The bridge cracked. Right at the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Balrog's feet it broke, and the stone upon which it stood crashed into the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">gulf, while the rest remained, poised, quivering like a tongue of rock<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">thrust out into emptiness.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">With a terrible cry the Balrog fell forward, and its shadow plunged<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">down and vanished. But even as it fell it swung its whip, and the thongs<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">lashed and curled about the wizardâ€™s knees, dragging him to the brink. He<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">staggered and fell, grasped vainly at the stone, and slid into the abyss.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™Fly, you fools! ' he cried, and was gone.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The fires went out, and blank darkness fell. The Company stood rooted<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with horror staring into the pit. Even as Aragorn and Boromir came flying<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">back, the rest of the bridge cracked and fell. With a cry Aragorn roused<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™Come! I will lead you now ! ' he called. 'We must obey his last<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">command. Follow me! '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They stumbled wildly up the great stairs beyond the door. Aragorn<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">leading, Boromir at the rear. At the top was a wide echoing passage. Along<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">this they fled. Frodo heard Sam at his side weeping, and then he found that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he himself was weeping as he ran. Doom, doom, doom the drum-beats rolled<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">behind, mournful now and slow; doom!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They ran on. The light grew before them; great shafts pierced the roof.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They ran swifter. They passed into a hall, bright with daylight from its<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">high windows in the east. They fled across it. Through its huge broken doors<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they passed, and suddenly before them the Great Gates opened, an arch of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">blazing light.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There was a guard of ores crouching in the shadows behind the great<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">door posts towering on either side, but the gates were shattered and cast<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">down. Aragorn smote to the ground the captain that stood in his path, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the rest fled in terror of his wrath. The Company swept past them and took<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">no heed of them. Out of the Gates they ran and sprang down the huge and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">age-worn steps, the threshold of Moria.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Thus, at last, they came beyond hope under the sky and felt the wind on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">their faces.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They did not halt until they were out of bowshot from the walls.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Dimrill Dale lay about them. The shadow of the Misty Mountains lay upon it,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">but eastwards there was a golden light on the land. It was but one hour<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">after noon. The sun was shining; the clouds were white and high.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They looked back. Dark yawned the archway of the Gates under the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mountain-shadow. Faint and far beneath the earth rolled the slow drum-beats:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">doom. A thin black smoke trailed out. Nothing else was to be seen; the dale<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">all around was empty. Doom. Grief at last wholly overcame them, and they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wept long: some standing and silent, some cast upon the ground. Doom, doom.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The drum-beats faded.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Alas! I Fear we cannot stay here longer,' said Aragorn. He looked<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">towards the mountains and held up his sword. 'Farewell, Gandalf ! ' he cried.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Did I not say to you: if you pass the doors of Moria, bewarel Alas that I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He turned to the Company. 'We must do without hope,' he said. 'At least<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They rose and looked about them. Northward the dale ran up into a glen<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of shadows between two great arms of the mountains, above which three white<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">peaks were shining: Celebdil, Fanuidhol, Caradhras. the Mountains of Moria.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At the head of the glen a torrent flowed like a white lace over an endless<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ladder of short falls, and a mist of foam hung in the air about the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Yonder is the Dimrill Stair,' said Aragorn, pointing to the falls.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Down the deep-cloven way that climbs beside the torrent we should have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">away.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">To the east the outflung arm of the mountains marched to a sudden end,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and far lands could be descried beyond them, wide and vague. To the south<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Misty Mountains receded endlessly as far as sight could reach. Less than<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">west side of the dale, there lay a mere. It was long and oval, shaped like a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">great spear-head thrust deep into the northern glen; but its southern end<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">deep blue like clear evening sky seen from a lamp-lit room. Its face was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">still and unruffled. About it lay a smooth sward, shelving down on all sides<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to its bare unbroken rim.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">bend led them hard by the sward of Mirrormere, and there not far from the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">roadside stood a single column broken at the top.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'That is Durin's Stone! ' cried Gimli. 'I cannot pass without turning<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">aside for a moment to look at the wonder of the dale ! '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Be swift then! ' said Aragorn, looking back towards the Gates. 'The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sun sinks early. The Ores will not, maybe, come out till after dusk, but we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">must be far away before nightfall. The Moon is almost spent, and it will be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dark tonight.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Come with me, Frodo! ' cried the dwarf, springing from the road. 'I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">would not have you go without seeing Kheled-zvram.' He ran down the long<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">green slope. Frodo followed slowly, drawn by the still blue water in spite<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of hurt and weariness; Sam came up behind.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Beside the standing stone Gimli halted and looked up. It was cracked<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and weather-worn, and the faint runes upon its side could not be read. 'This<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">pillar marks the spot where Durin first looked in the Mirrormere,' said the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dwarf. 'Let us look ourselves once, ere we go!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They stooped over the dark water. At first they could see nothing. Then<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">slowly they saw the forms of the encircling mountains mirrored in a profound<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">blue, and the peaks were like plumes of white flame above them; beyond there<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was a space of sky. There like jewels sunk in the deep shone glinting stars,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">though sunlight was in the sky above. Of their own stooping forms no shadow<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">could be seen.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'O Kheled-zvram fair and wonderful! ' said Gimli. 'There lies the Crown<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of Durin till he wakes. Farewell! ' He bowed, and turned away, and hastened<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">back up the green-sward to the road again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'What did you see? ' said Pippin to Sam, but Sam was too deep in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">thought to answer.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The road now turned south and went quickly downwards, running out from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">between the arms of the dale. Some way below the mere they came on a deep<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">well of water, clear as crystal, from which a freshet fell over a stone lip<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and ran glistening and gurgling down a steep rocky channel.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Here is the spring from which the Silverlode rises.' said Gimli. 'Do<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">not drink of it! It is icy cold.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Soon it becomes a swift river, and it gathers water from many other<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mountain- streams,' said Aragorn. 'Our road leads beside it for many miles.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For I shall take you by the road that Gandalf chose, and first I hope to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">come to the woods where the Silverlode flows into the Great River-out<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">yonder.' They looked as he pointed, and before them they could see the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stream leaping down to the trough of the valley, and then running on and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">away into the lower lands, until it was lost in a golden haze.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'There lie the woods of Lothlurien! â€™ said Legolas. 'That is the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fairest of all the dwellings of my people. There are no trees like the trees<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of that land. For in the autumn their leaves fall not, but turn to gold. Not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">till the spring comes and the new green opens do they fall, and then the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">boughs are laden with yellow flowers; and the floor of the wood is golden,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and golden is the roof, and its pillars are of silver, for the bark of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">trees is smooth and grey. So still our songs in Mirkwood say. My heart would<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">be glad if I were beneath the eaves of that wood, and it were springtime ! â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'My heart will be glad, even in the winter,' said Aragorn. 'But it lies<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">many miles away. Let us hasten! '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For some time Frodo and Sam managed to keep up with the others; but<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Aragorn was leading them at a great pace, and after a while they lagged<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">behind. They had eaten nothing since the early morning. Sam's cut was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">burning like fire, and his head felt light. In spite of the shining sun the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wind seemed chill after the warm darkness of Moria. He shivered. Frodo felt<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">every step more painful and he gasped for breath.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At last Legolas turned, and seeing them now far behind, he spoke to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Aragorn. The others halted, and Aragorn ran back, calling to Boromir to come<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I am sorry, Frodo! ' he cried, full of concern. 'So much has happened<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">this day and we have such need of haste, that I have forgotten that you were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hurt; and Sam too. You should have spoken. We have done nothing to ease<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">as we ought, though all the ores of Moria were after us. Come now! A little<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">further on there is a place where we can rest for a little. There I will do<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">what I can for you. Come, Boromir! We will carry them.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Soon afterwards they came upon another stream that ran down from the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">west, and joined its bubbling water with the hurrying Silverlode. Together<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they plunged over a fall of green-hued stone, and foamed down into a dell.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">About it stood fir-trees, short and bent, and its sides were steep and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">clothed with harts-tongue and shrubs of whortle -berry. At the bottom there<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was a level space through which the stream flowed noisily over shining<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">pebbles. Here they rested. It was now nearly three hours after noon, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they had come only a few miles from the Gates. Already the sun was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">westering.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">While Gimli and the two younger hobbits kindled a fire of brush- and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fir-wood, and drew water, Aragorn tended Sam and Frodo. Sam's wound was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">deep, but it looked ugly, and Aragornâ€™s face was grave as he examined it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After a moment he looked up with relief.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™Good luck, Sam! â€™ he said. 'Many have received worse than this in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">payment for the slaying of their first ore. The cut is not poisoned, as the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wounds of ore-blades too often are. It should heal well when I have tended<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it. Bathe it when Gimli has heated water.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He opened his pouch and drew out some withered leaves. 'They are dry<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and some of their virtue has one, he said, but here I have still some of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">leaves of athelas that I gathered near Weathertop. Crush one in the water,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and wash the wound clean, and I will bind it. Now it is your turn. Frodo! '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I am all right,' said Frodo, reluctant to have his garments touched.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'All I needed was some food and a little rest.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'No! ' said Aragorn. 'We must have a look and see what the hammer and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the anvil have done to you. I still marvel that you are alive at all.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gently he stripped off Frodo's old jacket and worn tunic, and gave a gasp of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wonder. Then he laughed. The silver corslet shimmered before his eyes like<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the light upon a rippling sea. Carefully he took it off and held it up, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the gems on it glittered like stars, and the sound of the shaken rings was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">like the tinkle of rain in a pool.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Look, my friends!â€™ he called. 'Here's a pretty hobbit-skin to wrap an<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">el ven -princeling in! If it were known that hobbits had such hides, all the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hunters of Middle-earth would be riding to the Shire.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'And all the arrows of all the hunters in the world would be in vain,'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">said Gimli, gazing at the mail in wonder. 'It is a mithril-coat. Mithril! I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">have never seen or heard tell of one so fair. Is this the coat that Gandalf<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">spoke of? Then he undervalued it. But it was well given! '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I have often wondered what you and Bilbo were doing, so close in his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">little room,' said Merry. 'Bless the old hobbit! I love him more than ever.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I hope we get a chance of telling him about it! '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There was a dark and blackened bruise on Frodo's right side and breast.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Under the mail there was a shirt of soft leather, but at one point the rings<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">had been driven through it into the flesh. Frodo's left side also was scored<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and bruised where he had been hurled against the wall. While the others set<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the food ready. Aragorn bathed the hurts with water in which athelas was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">steeped. The pungent fragrance filled the dell, and all those who stooped<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">over the steaming water felt refreshed and strengthened. Soon Frodo felt the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">pain leave him, and his breath grew easy: though he was stiff and sore to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the touch for many days. Aragorn bound some soft pads of cloth at his side.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'The mail is marvellously light,' he said. 'Put it on again, if you can<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">bear it. My heart is glad to know that you have such a coat. Do not lay it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">aside, even in sleep, unless fortune brings you where you are safe for a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">while; and that will seldom chance while your quest lasts.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">When they had eaten, the Company got ready to go on. They put out the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fire and hid all traces of it. Then climbing out of the dell they took to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the road again. They had not gone far before the sun sank behind the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">westward heights and great shadows crept down the mountain-sides. Dusk<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">veiled their feet, and mist rose in the hollows. Away in the east the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">evening light lay pale upon the dim lands of distant plain and wood. Sam and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo now feeling eased and greatly refreshed were able to go at a fair<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">pace, and with only one brief halt Aragorn led the Company on for nearly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">three more hours.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It was dark. Deep night had fallen. There were many clear stars, hut<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the fast- waning moon would not be seen till late. Gimli and Frodo were at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the rear, walking softly and not speaking, listening for any sound upon the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">road behind. At length Gimli broke the silence.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Not a sound but the wind,' he said. 'There are no goblins near, or my<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ears are made of wood. It is to be hoped that the Ores will be content with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">driving us from Moria. And maybe that was all their purpose, and they had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">nothing else to do with us-with the Ring. Though Ores will often pursue foes<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">for many leagues into the plain, if they have a fallen captain to avenge.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo did not answer. He looked at Sting, and the blade was dull. Yet<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he had heard something, or thought he had. As soon as the shadows had fallen<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">about them and the road behind was dim, he had heard again the quick patter<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of feet. Even now he heard it. He turned swiftly. There were two tiny gleams<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of light behind, or for a moment he thought he saw them, but at once they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">slipped aside and vanished.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'What is it? ' said the dwarf.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I don't know.' answered Frodo. 'I thought I heard feet, and I thought<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I saw a light-like eyes. I have thought so often, since we first entered<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Moria.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gimli halted and stooped to the ground. 'I hear nothing but the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">night-speech of plant and stone,' he said. 'Come! Let us hurry! The others<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">are out of sight.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The night-wind blew chill up the valley to meet them. Before them a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wide grey shadow loomed, and they heard an endless rustle of leaves like<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">poplars in the breeze.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Lothlurien! ' cried Legolas. 'Lothlurien! We have come to the eaves of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Golden Wood. Alas that it is winter! '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Under the night the trees stood tall before them, arched over the road<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and stream that ran suddenly beneath their spreading boughs. In the dim<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">light of the stars their stems were grey, and their quivering leaves a hint<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of fallow gold.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Lothlurien! ' said Aragorn. 'Glad I am to hear again the wind in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">trees! We are still little more than five leagues from the Gates, but we can<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">go no further. Here let us hope that the virtue of the Elves will keep us<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">tonight from the peril that comes behind.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'If Elves indeed still dwell here in the darkening world,' said Gimli.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'It is long since any of my own folk journeyed hither back to the land<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">whence we wandered in ages long ago,' said Legolas, 'but we hear that Lurien<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">is not yet deserted, for there is a secret power here that holds evil from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the land. Nevertheless its folk are seldom seen, and maybe they dwell now<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">deep in the woods and far from the northern border.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Indeed deep in the wood they dwell,' said Aragorn, and sighed as if<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">some memory stirred in him. 'We must fend for ourselves tonight. We will go<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">forward a short way, until the trees are all about us, and then we will turn<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">aside from the path and seek a place to rest in.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He stepped forward; but Boromir stood irresolute and did not follow.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Is there no other way? ' he said.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'What other fairer way would you desire? â€™ said Aragorn.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'A plain road, though it led through a hedge of swords,' said Boromir.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'By strange paths has this Company been led, and so far to evil fortune.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Against my will we passed under the shades of Moria, to our loss. And now we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">must enter the Golden Wood, you say. But of that perilous land we have heard<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in Gondor, and it is said that few come out who once go in; and of that few<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">none have escaped unscathed.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Say not unscathed, but if you say unchanged, then maybe you will speak<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the truth said Aragorn. But lore wanes in Gondor, Boromir, if in the city of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">those who once were wise they now speak evil of Lothlurien. Believe what you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">will, there is no other way for us â€” unless you would go back to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Moria-gate, or scale the pathless mountains, or swim the Great River all<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">alone.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Then lead on! ' said Boromir. 'But it is perilous.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Perilous indeed,' said Aragorn, 'fair and perilous; but only evil need<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fear it, or those who bring some evil with them. Follow me! '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They had gone little more than a mile into the forest when they came<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">upon another stream flowing down swiftly from the tree-clad slopes that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">climbed back westward towards the mountains. They heard it splashing over a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fall away among the shadows on their right. Its dark hurrying waters ran<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">across the path before them, and joined the Silverlode in a swirl of dim<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">pools among the roots of trees.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Here is Nimrodel! ' said Legolas. 'Of this stream the Silvan Elves<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">made many songs long ago, and still we sing them in the North, remembering<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the rainbow on its falls, and the golden flowers that floated in its foam.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">All is dark now and the Bridge of Nimrodel is broken down. I will bathe my<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">feet, for it is said that the water is healing to the weary.' He went<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">forward and climbed down the deep-cloven bank and stepped into the stream.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Follow me!â€™ he cried. 'The water is not deep. Let us wade across! On<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the further bank we can rest, and the sound of the falling water may bring<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">us sleep and forgetfulness of grief.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">One by one they climbed down and followed Legolas. For a moment Frodo<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stood near the brink and let the water flow over his tired feet. It was cold<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">but its touch was clean, and as he went on and it mounted to his knees, he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">felt that the stain of travel and all weariness was washed from his limbs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">When all the Company had crossed, they sat and rested and ate a little<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">food; and Legolas told them tales of Lothlurien that the Elves of Mirkwood<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">still kept in their hearts, of sunlight and starlight upon the meadows by<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Great River before the world was grey.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At length a silence fell, and they heard the music of the waterfall<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">running sweetly in the shadows. Almost Frodo fancied that he could hear a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">voice singing, mingled with the sound of the water.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Do you hear the voice of Nimrodel? ' asked Legolas. 'I will sing you a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">song of the maiden Nimrodel, who bore the same name as the stream beside<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">which she lived lung ago. It is a fair song in our woodland tongue; but this<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">is how it runs in the Westron Speech, as some in Rivendell now sing it.' In<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a soft voice hardly to be heard amid the rustle of the leaves above them he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">began:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">An Elven-maid there was of old,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A shining star by day:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Her mantle white was hemmed with gold,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Her shoes of silver-grey.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A star was bound upon her brows,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A light was on her hair<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As sun upon the golden boughs<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In Lurien the fair.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Her hair was long, her limbs were white,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And fair she was and free;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And in the wind she went as light<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As leaf of linden-tree.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Beside the falls of Nimrodel,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">By water clear and cool,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Her voice as falling silver fell<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Into the shining pool.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For lost of yore was Nimrodel<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A wind by night in Northern lands<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">When dawn came dim the land was lost,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Elves of Nimrodel's kindred left their dwellings and departed and she<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was lost far in the South, in the passes of the White Mountains; and she<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">came not to the ship where Amroth her lover waited for her. But in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">spring when the wind is in the new leaves the echo of her voice may still be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">heard by the falls that bear her name. And when the wind is in the South the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">voice of Amroth comes up from the sea; for Nimrodel flows into Silverlode,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that Elves call Celebrant, and Celebrant into Anduin the Great, and Anduin<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">flows into the Bay of B elf alas whence the Elves of Lurien set sail. But<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">neither Nimrodel nor Amroth ever came back.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'It is told that she had a house built in the branches of a tree that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">grew near the falls; for that was the custom of the Elves of Lurien, to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dwell in the trees, and maybe it is so still. Therefore they were called the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Galadhrim, the Tree -people. Deep in their forest the trees are very great.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The people of the woods did not delve in the ground like Dwarves, nor build<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">strong places of stone before the Shadow came.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'And even in these latter days dwelling in the trees might be thought<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">safer than sitting on the ground,' said Gimli. He looked across the stream<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to the road that led back to Dimrill Dale, and then up into the roof of dark<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">boughs above.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Your words bring good counsel, Gimli,' said Aragorn. 'We cannot build<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a house, but tonight we will do as the Galadhrim and seek refuge in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">tree-tops, if we can. We have sat here beside the road already longer than<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was wise.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Company now turned aside from the path, and went into the shadow of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the deeper woods, westward along the mountain-stream away from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Silverlode.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Not far from the falls of Nimrodel they found a cluster of trees, some of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">which overhung the stream. Their great grey trunks were of mighty girth, but<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">their height could not be guessed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I will climb up,â€™ said Legolas. 'I am at home among trees, by root or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">bough, though these trees are of a kind strange to me, save as a name in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">song. Mellyrn they are called, and are those that bear the yellow blossom,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">but I have never climbed in one. I will see now what is their shape and way<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of growth.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Whatever it may be,' said Pippin, 'they will be marvellous trees<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">indeed if they can offer any rest at night, except to birds. I cannot sleep<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">on a perch ! â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Then dig a hole in the ground,' said Legolas, 'if that is more after<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the fashion of your kind. But you must dig swift and deep, if you wish to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hide from Ores.â€™ He sprang lightly up from the ground and caught a branch<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that grew from the trunk high above his head. But even as he swung there for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a moment, a voice spoke suddenly from the tree-shadows above him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">' Daro !' it said in commanding tone, and Legolas dropped back to earth<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in surprise and fear. He shrank against the bole of the tree.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Stand still! ' he whispered to the others. 'Do not move or speak! â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There was a sound of soft laughter over their heads, and then another<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">clear voice spoke in an elven-tongue. Frodo could understand little of what<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was said, for the speech that the Silvan folk east of the mountains used<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">among themselves was unlike that of the West. Legolas looked up and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">answered<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in the same language.*<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Who are they, and what do they say? â€™ asked Merry.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'They're Elves,' said Sam. 'Can't you hear their voices? '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Yes, they are Elves,' said Legolas; 'and they say that you breathe so<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">loud that they could shoot you in the dark.' Sam hastily put his hand over<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his mouth. 'But they say also that you need have no fear. They have been<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">aware of us for a long while. They heard my voice across the Nimrodel, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">knew that I was one of their Northern kindred, and therefore they did not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hinder our crossing; and afterwards they heard my song. Now they bid me<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">climb up with Frodo; for they seem to have had some tidings of him and of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">our journey. The others they ask to wait a little and to keep watch at the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">foot of the tree, until they have decided what is to be done.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Out of the shadows a ladder was let down: it was made of rope,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">silver-grey and glimmering in the dark, and though it looked slender it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">proved strong enough to bear many men. Legolas ran lightly up, and Frodo<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">followed slowly; behind came Sam trying not to breathe loudly. The branches<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of the mallorn-tree grew out nearly straight from the trunk, and then swept<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">upward; but near the top the main stem divided into a crown of many boughs,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and among these they found that there had been built a wooden platform, or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">flet as such things were called in those days: the Elves called it a talan.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It was reached by a round hole in the centre through which the ladder<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">passed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">When Frodo came at last up on to the flet he found Legolas seated with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">three other Elves. They were clad in shadowy-grey, and could not be seen<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">among the tree-stems, unless they moved suddenly. They stood up, and one of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">them uncovered a small lamp that gave out a slender silver beam. He held it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">up, looking at Frodo's face, and Sam's. Then he shut off the light again,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and spoke words of welcome in his elven-tongue. Frodo spoke haltingly in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">return.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Welcome!' the Elf then said again in the Common Fanguage, speaking<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">slowly. 'We seldom use any tongue but our own; for we dwell now in the heart<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of the forest, and do not willingly have dealings with any other folk. Even<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">our own kindred in the North are sundered from us. But there are some of us<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">still who go abroad for the gathering of news and the watching of our<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">enemies, and they speak the languages of other lands. I am one. Haldir is my<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">name. My brothers, RÂ®mil and Orophin, speak little of your tongue.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'But we have heard rumours of your coming, for the messengers of Elrond<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">passed by Furien on their way home up the Dimrill Stair. We had not heard of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hobbits, or halflings, for many a long year, and did not know that any yet<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dwelt in Middle-earth. You do not look evil! And since you come with an Elf<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of our kindred, we are willing to befriend you, as Elrond asked; though it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">is not our custom to lead strangers through our land. But you must stay here<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">tonight. How many are you? â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Eight,' said Legolas. 'Myself, four hobbits; and two men, one of whom,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Aragorn, is an Elf-friend of the folk of Westernesse.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'The name of Aragorn son of Arathorn is known in Lurien,' said Haldir,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'and he has the favour of the Lady. All then is well. But you have yet<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">spoken only of seven.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'The eighth is a dwarf,' said Legolas.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'A dwarf! â€™ said Haldir. 'That is not well. We have not had dealings<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with the Dwarves since the Dark Days. They are not permitted in our land. I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">cannot allow him to pass.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'But he is from the Lonely Mountain, one of Dbin's trusty people, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">friendly to Elrond,' said Frodo. 'Elrond himself chose him to be one of our<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">companions, and he has been brave and faithful.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Elves spoke together in soft voices, and questioned Legolas in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">their own tongue. 'Very good,' said Haldir at last. 'We will do this, though<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it is against our liking. If Aragorn and Legolas will guard him, and answer<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">for him, he shall pass; but he must go blindfold through Lothlurien.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'But now we must debate no longer. Your folk must not remain on the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ground. We have been keeping watch on the rivers, ever since we saw a great<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">troop of Ores going north toward Moria, along the skirts of the mountains,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">many days ago. Wolves are howling on the wood's borders. If you have indeed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">come from Moria, the peril cannot be far behind. Tomorrow early you must go<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">on.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'The four hobbits shall climb up here and stay with us- we do not fear<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">them! There is another ta Ian in the next tree. There the others must take<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">refuge. You, Legolas, must answer to us for them. Call us, if anything is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">amiss! And have an eye on that dwarf!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Legolas at once went down the ladder to take Haldir's message; and soon<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">afterwards Merry and Pippin clambered up on to the high flet. They were out<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of breath and seemed rather scared.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'There!' said Merry panting. 'We have lugged up your blankets as well<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">as our own. Strider has hidden all the rest of the baggage in a deep drift<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of leaves.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You had no need of your burdens,' said Haldir. 'It is cold in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">tree-tops in winter, though the wind tonight is in the South; but we have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">food and drink to give you that will drive away the night-chill, and we have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">skins and cloaks to spare.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The hobbits accepted this second (and far better) supper very gladly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Then they wrapped themselves warmly, not only in the fur-cloaks of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Elves, but in their own blankets as well, and tried to go to sleep. But<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">weary as they were only Sam found that easy to do. Hobbits do not like<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">heights, and do not sleep upstairs, even when they have any stairs. The flet<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was not at all to their liking as a bedroom. It had no walls, not even a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">rail; only on one side was there a light plaited screen, which could be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">moved and fixed in different places according to the wind.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Pippin went on talking for a while. 'I hope, if I do go to sleep in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">this bed-loft, that I shan't roll off,' he said.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Once I do get to sleep,â€™ said Sam, â€™i shall go on sleeping, whether I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">roll off or no. And the less said, the sooner I'll drop off, if you take my<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo lay for some time awake, and looked up at the stars glinting<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">through the pale roof of quivering leaves. Sam was snoring at his side long<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">before he himself closed his eyes. He could dimly see the grey forms of two<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">elves sitting motionless with their arms about their knees, speaking in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">whispers. The other had gone down to take up his watch on one of the lower<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">branches. At last lulled by the wind in the boughs above, and the sweet<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">murmur of the falls of Nimrodel below, Frodo fell asleep with the song of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Legolas running in his mind.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Late in the night he awoke. The other hobbits were asleep. The Elves<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were gone. The sickle Moon was gleaming dimly among the leaves. The wind<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">still. A little way off he heard a harsh laugh and the tread of many feet on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the ground below. There was a ring of metal. The sounds died slowly away,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and seemed to go southward, on into the wood.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A head appeared suddenly through the hole in the flet. Frodo sat up in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">alarm and saw that it was a grey-hooded Elf. He looked towards the hobbits.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'What is it? ' said Frodo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">' Yrch !' said the Elf in a hissing whisper, and cast on to the flet the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">rope-ladder rolled up.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Ores! ' said Frodo. 'What are they doing? ' But the Elf had gone.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There were no more sounds. Even the leaves were silent, and the very<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">falls seemed to be hushed. Frodo sat and shivered in his wraps. He was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">thankful that they had not been caught on the ground; but he felt that the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">trees offered little protection, except concealment. Ores were as keen as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hounds on a scent, it was said, but they could also climb. He drew out<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sting: it flashed and glittered like a blue flame and then slowly faded<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">again and grew dull. In spite of the fading of his sword the feeling of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">immediate danger did not leave Frodo, rather it grew stronger. He got up and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">crawled to the opening and peered down. He was almost certain that he could<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hear stealthy movements at the treeâ€™s foot far below.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Not Elves; for the woodland folk were altogether noiseless in their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">movements. Then he heard faintly a sound like sniffing: and something seemed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to be scrabbling on the bark of the tree-trunk. He stared down into the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dark, holding his breath.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Something was now climbing slowly, and its breath came like a soft<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hissing through closed teeth. Then coming up, close to the stem, Frodo saw<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">two pale eyes. They stopped and gazed upward unwinking. Suddenly they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">turned<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">away, and a shadowy figure slipped round the trunk of the tree and vanished.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Immediately afterwards Haldir came climbing swiftly up through the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">branches. 'There was something in this tree that I have never seen before,'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he said. 'It was not an ore. It fled as soon as I touched the tree -stem. It<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">seemed to be wary, and to have some skill in trees, or I might have thought<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that it was one of you hobbits.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I did not shoot, for I dared not arouse any cries: we cannot risk<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">battle. A strong company of Ores has passed. They crossed the Nimrodel-curse<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">their foul feet in its clean water! -and went on down the old road beside the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">river. They seemed to pick up some scent, and they searched the ground for a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">while near the place where you halted. The three of us could not challenge a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hundred, so we went ahead and spoke with feigned voices, leading them on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">into the wood.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Orophin has now gone in haste back to our dwellings to warn our<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">people. None of the Ores will ever return out of Lurien. And there will be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">many Elves hidden on the northern border before another night falls. But you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">must take the road south as soon as it is fully light.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Day came pale from the East. As the light grew it filtered through the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">yellow leaves of the mallorn, and it seemed to the hobbits that the early<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sun of a cool summer's morning was shining. Pale-blue sky peeped among the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">moving branches. Looking through an opening on the south side of the flet<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo saw all the valley of the Silverlode lying like a sea of fallow gold<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">tossing gently in the breeze.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The morning was still young and cold when the Company set out again,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">guided now by Haldir and his brother RÂ®mil. 'Farewell, sweet Nimrodel! '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">cried Legolas. Frodo looked back and caught a gleam of white foam among<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">grey tree-stems. 'Farewell,' he said. It seemed to him that he would never<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hear again a running water so beautiful, for ever blending its innumerable<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">notes in an endless changeful music.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They went back to the path that still went on along the west side of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Silverlode, and for some way they followed it southward. There were the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">prints of ore-feet in the earth. But soon Haldir turned aside into the trees<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and halted on the bank of the river under their shadows.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'There is one of my people yonder across the stream,' he said 'though<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you may not see him.' He gave a call like the low whistle of a bird, and out<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of a thicket of young trees an Elf stepped, clad in grey, but with his hood<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">thrown back; his hair glinted like gold in the morning sun. Haldir skilfully<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">cast over the stream a coil of grey rope, and he caught it and bound the end<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">about a tree near the bank.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Celebrant is already a strong stream here, as you see,' said Haldir<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'and it runs both swift and deep, and is very cold. We do not set foot in it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">so far north, unless we must. But in these days of watchfulness we do not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">make bridges. This is how we cross! Follow me!' He made his end of the rope<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fast about another tree, and then ran lightly along it, over the river and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">back again, as if he were on a road.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">V I can walk this path,' said Legolas; 'but the others have not this<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">skill. Must they swim?â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'No!' said Haldir. 'We have two more ropes. We will fasten them above<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the other, one shoulder-high, and another half-high, and holding these the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">strangers should be able to cross with care.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">When this slender bridge had been made, the Company passed over, some<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">cautiously and slowly, others more easily. Of the hobbits Pippin proved the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">best for he was sure-footed, and he walked over quickly, holding only with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">one hand; but he kept his eyes on the bank ahead and did not look down. Sam<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shuffled along, clutching hard, and looking down into the pale eddying water<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">as if it was a chasm in the mountains.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He breathed with relief when he was safely across. 'Live and learn! as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">my gaffer used to say. Though he was thinking of gardening, not of roosting<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">like a bird, nor of trying to walk like a spider. Not even my uncle Andy<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ever did a trick like that! â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">When at length all the Company was gathered on the east bank of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Silverlode, the Elves untied the ropes and coiled two of them. RÂ®mil, who<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">had remained on the other side, drew back the last one, slung it on his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shoulder, and with a wave of his hand went away, back to Nimrodel to keep<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">watch.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Now, friends,' said Haldir, 'you have entered the Naith of Lurien or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Gore, as you would say, for it is the land that lies like a spear -head<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">between the arms of Silverlode and Anduin the Great. We allow no strangers<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to spy out the secrets of the Naith. Few indeed are permitted even to set<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">foot there.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'As was agreed, I shall here blindfold the eyes of Gimli the Dwarf. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">other may walk free for a while, until we come nearer to our dwellings, down<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in Egladil, in the Angle between the waters.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">This was not at all to the liking of Gimli. 'The agreement was made<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">without my consent,' he said. 'I will not walk blindfold, like a beggar or a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">prisoner. And I am no spy. My folk have never had dealings with any of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">servants of the Enemy. Neither have we done harm to the Elves. I am no more<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">likely to betray you than Legolas, or any other of my companions.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™I do not doubt you,â€™ said Haldir. 'Yet this is our law. I am not the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">master of the law, and cannot set it aside. I have done much in letting you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">set foot over Celebrant.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gimli was obstinate. He planted his feet firmly apart, and laid his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hand upon the haft of his axe. 'I will go forward free,' he said, 'or I will<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">go back and seek my own land, where I am known to be true of word, though I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">perish alone in the wilderness.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You cannot go back,' said Haldir sternly. 'Now you have come thus far,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you must be brought before the Lord and the Lady. They shall judge you, to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hold you or to give you leave, as they will. You cannot cross the rivers<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">again, and behind you there are now secret sentinels that you cannot pass.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">You would be slain before you saw them.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gimli drew his axe from his belt. Haldir and his companion bent their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">bows. 'A plague on Dwarves and their stiff necks! ' said Legolas.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Come!' said Aragorn. 'If I am still to lead this Company, you must do<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">as I bid. It is hard upon the Dwarf to be thus singled out. We will all be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">blindfold, even Legolas. That will be best, though it will make the journey<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">slow and dull.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gimli laughed suddenly. 'A merry troop of fools we shall look! Will<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Haldir lead us all on a string, like many blind beggars with one dog? But I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">will be content, if only Legolas here shares my blindness.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I am an Elf and a kinsman here,â€™ said Legolas, becoming angry in his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">turn.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Now let us cry: "a plague on the stiff necks of Elves!"' said Aragorn.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'But the Company shall all fare alike. Come, bind our eyes Haldir! '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I shall claim full amends for every fall and stubbed toe, if you do<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">not lead us well,â€™ said Gimli as they bound a cloth about his eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You will have no claim,' said Haldir. 'I shall lead you well, and the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Dark Lord more clearly shown than in the estrangement that divides all<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">those who still oppose him. Yet so little faith and trust do we find now in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the world beyond Lothlurien, unless maybe in Rivendell, that we dare not by<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">our own trust endanger our land. We live now upon an island amid many<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">perils, and our hands are more often upon the bowstring than upon the harp.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'The rivers long defended us, but they are a sure guard no more for the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Shadow has crept northward all about us. Some speak of departing, yet for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that it already seems too late. The mountains to the west are growing evil;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to the east the lands are waste, and full of Sauronâ€™s creatures; and it is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">rumoured that we cannot now safely pass southward through Rohan, and the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mouths of the Great River are watched by the Enemy. Even if we could come<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">said that there are still havens of. the High Elves, but they are far north<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and west, beyond the land of the Halflings. But where that may be, though<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Lord and Lady may know, I do not.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You ought at least to guess, since you have seen us,â€™ said Merry.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'There are Elf-havens west of my land, the Shire where Hobbits live.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I cannot,â€™ said Merry. 'I have never seen them. I have never been out<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Not even to see fair Lothlurien? â€™ said Haldir. â€™The world is indeed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">full of peril, and in it there are many dark places; but still there is much<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that is fair, and though in all lands love is now mingled with grief, it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">grows perhaps the greater.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Some there are among us who sing that the Shadow will draw back and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">peace shall come again. Yet I do not believe that the world about us will<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ever again be as it was of old, or the light of the Sun as it was aforetime.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For the Elves, I fear, it will prove at best a truce, in which they may pass<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to the Sea unhindered and leave the Middle-earth for ever. Alas for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Lothlurien that I love! It would be a poor life in a land where no mallorn<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">grew. But if there are mallorn-trees beyond the Great Sea, none have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">reported it.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As they spoke thus, the Company filed slowly along the paths in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wood, led by Haldir, while the other Elf walked behind. They felt the ground<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">beneath their feet smooth and soft, and after a while they walked more<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">freely, without fear of hurt or fall. Being deprived of sight, Frodo found<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his hearing and other senses sharpened. He could smell the trees and the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">trodden grass. He could hear many different notes in the rustle of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">leaves overhead, the river murmuring away on his right, and the thin clear<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">voices of birds in the sky. He felt the sun upon his face and hands when<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they passed through an open glade.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As soon as he set foot upon the far bank of Silverlode a strange<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">feeling had come upon him, and it deepened as he walked on into the Naith:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it seemed to him that he had stepped over a bridge of time into a corner of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Elder Days, and was -now walking in a world that was no more. In<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Rivendell there was memory of ancient things; in Lurien the ancient things<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">still lived on in the waking world. Evil had been seen and heard there,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sorrow had been known; the Elves feared and distrusted the world outside:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wolves were howling on the wood's borders: but on the land of Lurien no<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shadow lay.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">All that day the Company marched on, until they felt the cool evening<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">come and heard the early night- wind whispering among many leaves. Then<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">rested and slept without fear upon the ground; for their guides would not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">permit them to unbind their eyes, and they could not climb. In the morning<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they went on again, walking without haste. At noon they halted, and Frodo<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was aware that they had passed out under the shining Sun. Suddenly he heard<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the sound of many voices all around him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A marching host of Elves had come up silently: they were hastening<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">toward the northern borders to guard against any attack from Moria; and they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">brought news, some of which Haldir reported. The marauding ores had been<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">waylaid and almost all destroyed; the remnant had fled westward towards the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mountains, and were being pursued. A strange creature also had been seen,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">running with bent back and with hands near the ground, like a beast and yet<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">notofbeast-shape.lt had eluded capture, and they had not shot it, not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">knowing whether it was good or ill, and it had vanished down the Silverlode<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">southward.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Also,' said Haldir, "they bring me a message from the Lord and Lady of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Galadhrim. You are all to walk free, even the dwarf Gimli. It seems that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Lady knows who and what is each member of your Company. New<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">messages<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">have come from Rivendell perhaps.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He removed the bandage first from Gimli' s eyes. 'Your pardon! ' he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">said, bowing low. "Look on us now with friendly eyes! Look and be glad, for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you are the first dwarf to behold the trees of the Naith of Lurien since<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Durin's Day! '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">When his eyes were in turn uncovered, Frodo looked up and caught his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">breath. They were standing in an open space. To the left stood a great<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mound, covered with a sward of grass as green as Spring-time in the Elder<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Days. Upon it, as a double crown, grew two circles of trees: the outer had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">bark of snowy white, and were leafless but beautiful in their shapely<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">nakedness; the inner were mallorn-trees of great height, still arrayed in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">pale gold. High amid the branches of a towering tree that stood in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">centre of all there gleamed a white flet. At the feet of the trees, and all<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">about the green hillsides the grass was studded with small golden flowers<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shaped like stars. Among them, nodding on slender stalks, were other<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">flowers, white and palest green: they glimmered as a mist amid the rich hue<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of the grass. Over all the sky was blue, and the sun of afternoon glowed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">upon the hill and cast long green shadows beneath the trees.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Behold! You are come to Cerin Amroth,' said Haldir. "For this is the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">heart of the ancient realm as it was long ago, and here is the mound of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Amroth, where in happier days his high house was built. Here ever bloom the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">winter flowers in the unfading grass: the yellow elanor, and the pale<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">niphredil. Here we will stay awhile, and come to the city of the Galadhrim<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">at dusk.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The others cast themselves down upon the fragrant grass, but Frodo<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stood awhile still lost in wonder. It seemed to him that he had stepped<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">through a high window that looked on a vanished world. A light was upon it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">for which his language had no name. All that he saw was shapely, but the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shapes seemed at once clear cut, as if they had been first conceived and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">drawn at the uncovering of his eyes, and ancient as if they had endured for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ever. He saw no colour but those he knew, gold and white and blue and green,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">but they were fresh and poignant, as if he had at that moment first<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">perceived them and made for them names new and wonderful. In winter here<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">no<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">heart could mourn for summer or for spring. No blemish or sickness or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">deformity could be seen in anything that grew upon the earth. On the land of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Lurien there was no stain.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He turned and saw that Sam was now standing beside him, looking round<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with a puzzled expression, and rubbing his eyes as if he was not sure that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he was awake. 'It's sunlight and bright day, right enough,' he said. 'I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">thought that Elves were all for moon and stars: but this is more elvish than<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">anything I ever heard tell of. I feel as if I was inside a song, if you take<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">my meaning.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Haldir looked at them, and he seemed indeed to take the meaning of both<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">thought and word. He smiled. 'You feel the power of the Lady of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Galadhrim,' he said. 'Would it please you to climb with me up Cerin Amroth?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">f<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They followed him as he stepped lightly up the grass-clad slopes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Though he walked and breathed, and about him living leaves and flowers were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stirred by the same cool wind as fanned his face, Frodo felt that he was in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a timeless land that did not fade or change or fall into forgetfulness. When<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he had gone and passed again into the outer world, still Frodo the wanderer<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">from the Shire would walk there, upon the grass among elanor and niphredil<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in fair Lothlurien.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They entered the circle of white trees. As they did so the South Wind<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">blew upon Cerin Amroth and sighed among the branches. Frodo stood still,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hearing far off_ great seas upon beaches that had long ago been washed away,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and sea-birds crying whose race had perished from the earth.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Haldir had gone on and was now climbing to the high flet. As Frodo<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">prepared to follow him, he laid his hand upon the tree beside the ladder:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">never before had he been so suddenly and so keenly aware of the feel and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">texture of a tree's skin and of the life within it. He felt a delight in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wood and the touch of it, neither as forester nor as carpenter; it was the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">delight of the living tree itself.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As he stepped out at last upon the lofty platform, Haldir took his hand<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and turned him toward the South. 'Look this way first! â€™ he said.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo looked and saw, still at some distance, a hill of many mighty<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">trees, or a city of green towers: which it was he could not tell. Out of it,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it seemed to him that the power and light came that held all the land in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sway. He longed suddenly to fly like a bird to rest in the green city. Then<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he looked eastward and saw all the land of Lurien running down to the pale<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">gleam of Anduin, the Great River. He lifted his eyes across the river and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">all the light went out, and he was back again in the world he knew. Beyond<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the river the land appeared flat and empty, formless and vague, until far<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">away it rose again like a wall, dark and drear. The sun that lay on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Lothlurien had no power to enlighten the shadow of that distant height.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'There lies the fastness of Southern Mirkwood,' said Haldir. 'It is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">clad in a forest of dark fir, where the trees strive one against another and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">their branches rot and wither. In the midst upon a stony height stands Dol<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Guldur, where long the hidden Enemy had his dwelling. We fear that now it is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">inhabited again, and with power sevenfold. A black cloud lies often over it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of late. In this high place you may see the two powers that are opposed one<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to another; and ever they strive now in thought, but whereas the light<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">perceives the very heart of the darkness, its own secret has not been<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">discovered. Not yet.' He turned and climbed swiftly down, and they followed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At the hill's foot Frodo found Aragorn, standing still and silent as a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">tree; but in his hand was a small golden bloom of elanor, and a light was in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his eyes. He was wrapped in some fair memory: and as Frodo looked at him he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">knew that he beheld things as they once had been in this same place. For the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">grim years were removed from the face of Aragorn, and he seemed clothed in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">white, a young lord tall and fair; and he spoke words in the Elvish tongue<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to one whom Frodo could not see. Arwen vanimelda, nambril! he said, and then<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he drew a breath, and returning out of his thought he looked at Frodo and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">smiled.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Here is the heart of Elvendom on earth,' he said, 'and here my heart<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dwells ever, unless there be a light beyond the dark roads that we still<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">must tread, you and I. Come with me! ' And taking Frodo's hand in his, he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">left the hill of Cerin Amroth and came there never again as living man.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The sun was sinking behind the mountains, and the shadows were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">deepening in the woods, when they went on again. Their paths now went into<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">thickets where the dusk had already gathered. Night came beneath the trees<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">as they walked, and the Elves uncovered their silver lamps.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Suddenly they came out into the open again and found themselves under a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">pale evening sky pricked by a few early stars. There was a wide treeless<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">space before them, running in a great circle and bending away on either<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hand. Beyond it was a deep fosse lost in soft shadow, but the grass upon its<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">brink was green, as if it glowed still in memory of the sun that had gone.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Upon the further side there rose to a great height a green wall encircling a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">green hill thronged with mallorn-trees taller than any they had yet seen in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">all the land. Their height could not be guessed, but they stood up in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">twilight like living towers. In their, many -tiered branches and amid their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ever-moving leaves countless lights were gleaming, green and gold and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">silver. Haldir turned towards the Company.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Welcome to Caras Galadhon! ' he said. 'Here is the city of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Galadhrim where dwell the Lord Celeborn and Galadriel the Lady of Lurien.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But we cannot enter here, for the gates do not look northward. We must go<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">round to the southern side, and the way is not short, for the city is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">great.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There was a road paved with white stone running on the outer brink of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the fosse. Along this they went westward, with the city ever climbing up<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">like a green cloud upon their left; and as the night deepened more lights<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sprang forth, until all the hill seemed afire with stars. They came at last<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to a white bridge, and crossing found the great gates of the city: they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">faced south-west, set between the ends of the encircling wall that here<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">overlapped, and they were tall and strong, and hung with many lamps.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Haldir knocked and spoke, and the gates opened soundlessly; but of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">guards Lrodo could see no sign. The travellers passed within, and the gates<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shut behind them. They were in a deep lane between the ends of the wall, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">passing quickly through it they entered the City of the Trees. No folk could<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they see, nor hear any feet upon the paths; but there were many voices,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">about them, and in the air above. Ear away up on the hill they could hear<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the sound of singing falling from on high like soft rain upon leaves.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They went along many paths and climbed many stairs, until they came to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the high places and saw before them amid a wide lawn a fountain shimmering.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It was lit by silver lamps that swung from the boughs of trees, and it fell<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">into a basin of silver, from which a white stream spilled. Upon the south<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">side of the lawn there stood the mightiest of all the trees; its great<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">smooth bole gleamed like grey silk, and up it towered, until its first<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">branches, far above, opened their huge limbs under shadowy clouds of leaves.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Beside it a broad white ladder stood, and at its foot three Elves were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">seated. They sprang up as the travellers approached, and Frodo saw that they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were tall and clad in grey mail, and from their shoulders hung long white<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">cloaks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Here dwell Celeborn and Galadriel,' said Haldir. v It is their wish<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that you should ascend and speak with them.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">One of the Elf-wardens then blew a clear note on a small horn, and it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was answered three times from far above. V I will go first,' said Haldir.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Let Frodo come next and with him Legolas. The others may follow as they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wish. It is a long climb for those that are not accustomed to such stairs,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">but you may rest upon the way.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As he climbed slowly up Frodo passed many flets: some on one side, some<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">on another, and some set about the bole of the tree, so that the ladder<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">passed through them. At a great height above the ground he came to a wide<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">talan, like the deck of a great ship. On it was built a house, so large that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">almost it would have served for a hall of Men upon the earth. He entered<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">behind Haldir, and found that he was in a chamber of oval shape, in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">midst of which grew the trunk of the great mallorn, now tapering towards its<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">crown, and yet making still a pillar of wide girth.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The chamber was filled with a soft light; its walls were green and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">silver and its roof of gold. Many Elves were seated there. On two chairs<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">beneath the bole of the tree and canopied by a living bough there sat, side<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">by side, Celeborn and Galadriel. They stood up to greet their guests, after<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the manner of Elves, even those who were accounted mighty kings. Very tall<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they were, and the Lady no less tall than the Lord; and they were grave and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">beautiful. They were clad wholly in white; and the hair of the Lady was of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">deep gold, and the hair of the Lord Celeborn was of silver long and bright;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">but no sign of age was upon them, unless it were in the depths of their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">eyes; for these were keen as lances in the starlight, and yet profound, the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wells of deep memory.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Haldir led Frodo before them, and the Lord welcomed him in his own<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">tongue. The Lady Galadriel said no word but looked long upon his face.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Sit now beside my chair, Frodo of the Shire! ' said Celeborn. 'When<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">all have come we will speak together.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Each of the companions he greeted courteously by name as they entered.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Welcome Aragorn son of Arathorn! â€™ he said. 'It is eight and thirty years<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of the world outside since you came to this land; and those years lie heavy<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">on you. But the end is near, for good or ill. Here lay aside your burden for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a while ! '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Welcome son of Thranduil! Too seldom do my kindred journey hither from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the North.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Welcome Gimli son of Gluin! It is long indeed since we saw one of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Durin's folk in Caras Galadhon. But today we have broken our long law. May<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it be a sign that though the world is now dark better days are at hand, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that friendship shall be renewed between our peoples.' Gimli bowed low.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">When all the guests were seated before his chair the Lord looked at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">them again. 'Here there are eight,' he said. 'Nine were to set out: so said<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the messages. But maybe there has been some change of counsel that we have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">not heard. Elrond is far away, and darkness gathers between us, and all this<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">year the shadows have grown longer.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Nay, there was no change of counsel,' said the Lady Galadriel speaking<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">for the first time. Her voice was clear and musical, but deeper than woman's<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wont. 'Gandalf the Grey set out with the Company, but he did not pass the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">borders of this land. Now tell us where he is; for I much desired to speak<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with him again. But I cannot see him from afar, unless he comes within the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fences of Lothlurien: a grey mist is about him, and the ways of his feet and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of his mind are hidden from me.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Alas! ' said Aragorn. 'Gandalf the Grey fell into shadow. He remained<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in Moria and did not escape.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At these words all the Elves in the hall cried aloud in grief and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">amazement. 'These are evil tidings,' said Celeborn, 'the most evil that have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">been spoken here in long years full of grievous deeds.' He turned to Haldir.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Why has nothing of this been told to me before? ' he asked in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Elven-tongue.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'We have not spoken to Haldir of our deeds or our purpose,' said<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Legolas. 'At first we were weary and danger was too close behind and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">afterwards we almost forgot our grief for a time, as we walked in gladness<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">on the fair paths of Lurien.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Yet our grief is great and our loss cannot be mended,' said Frodo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™Gandalf was our guide, and he led us through Moria; and when our escape<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">seemed beyond hope he saved us, and he fell.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Tell us now the full tale! ' said Celeborn:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Then Aragorn recounted all that had happened upon the pass of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Caradhras, and in the days that followed; and he spoke of Balin and his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">book, and the fight in the Chamber of Mazarbul, and the fire, and the narrow<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">bridge, and the coming of the Terror. 'An evil of the Ancient World it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">seemed, such as I have never seen before,' said Aragorn. 'It was both a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shadow and a flame, strong and terrible.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'It was a Balrog of Morgoth,' said Legolas; 'of all elf-banes the most<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">deadly, save the One who sits in the Dark Tower.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Indeed I saw upon the bridge that which haunts our darkest dreams 1<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">saw Durin's Bane,' said Gimli in a low voice, and dread was in his eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Alas! ' said Celeborn. 'We long have feared that under Caradhras a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">terror slept. But had I known that the Dwarves had stirred up this evil in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Moria again, 1 would have forbidden you to pass the northern borders, you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and all that went with you. And if it were possible, one would say that at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the last Gandalf fell from wisdom into folly, going needlessly into the net<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of Moria.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'He would be rash indeed that said that thing,' said Galadriel gravely.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Needless were none of the deeds of Gandalf in life. Those that followed him<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">knew not his mind and cannot report his full purpose. But however it may be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with the guide, the followers are blameless. Do not repent of your welcome<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to the Dwarf. If our folk had been exiled long and far from Lothlurien, who<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of the Galadhrim, even Celeborn the Wise, would pass nigh and would not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wish<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to look upon their ancient home, though it had become an abode of dragons?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Dark is the water of Kheled-zvram, and cold are the springs of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Kibil-nvla, and fair were the many -pillared halls of Khazad-dym in Elder<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Days before the fall of mighty kings beneath the stone.' She looked upon<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gimli, who sat glowering and sad, and she smiled. And the Dwarf, hearing the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">names given in his own ancient tongue, looked up and met her eyes; and it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">seemed to him that he looked suddenly into the heart of an enemy and saw<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">there love and understanding. Wonder came into his face, and then he smiled<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in answer.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He rose clumsily and bowed in dwarf-fashion, saying: 'Yet more fair is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the living land of Lurien, and the Lady Galadriel is above all the jewels<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that lie beneath the earth! '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There was a silence. At length Celeborn spoke again. 'I did not know<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that your plight was so evil,â€™ he said. 'Let Gimli forget my harsh words: I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">spoke in the trouble of my heart. I will do what I can to aid you, each<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">according to his wish and need, but especially that one of the little folk<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">who bears the burden.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Your quest is known to us,' said Galadriel, looking at Frodo. 'But we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">will not here speak of it more openly. Yet not in vain will it prove, maybe,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that you came to this land seeking aid, as Gandalf himself plainly purposed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For the Lord of the Galadhrim is accounted the wisest of the Elves of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Middle-earth, and a giver of gifts beyond the power of kings. He has dwelt<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in the West since the days of dawn, and I have dwelt with him years<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">uncounted; for ere the fall of Nargothrond or Gondolin I passed over the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mountains, and together through ages of the world we have fought the long<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">defeat.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™I it was who first summoned the White Council. And if my designs had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">not gone amiss, it would have been governed by Gandalf the Grey, and then<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mayhap things would have gone otherwise. But even now there is hope left. I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">will not give you counsel, saying do this, or do that. For not in doing or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">contriving, nor in choosing between this course and another, can I avail;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">but only in knowing what was and is, and in part also what shall be. But<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">this I will say to you: your Quest stands upon the edge of a knife. Stray<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">but a little and it will fail, to the ruin of all. Yet hope remains while<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">all the Company is true.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And with that word she held them with her eyes, and in silence looked<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">searchingly at each of them in turn. None save Legolas and Aragorn could<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">long endure her glance. Sam quickly blushed and hung his head.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At length the Lady Galadriel released them from her eyes, and she<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">smiled. 'Do not let your hearts be troubled,' she said. 'Tonight you shall<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sleep in peace.' Then they sighed and felt suddenly weary, as those who have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">been questioned long and deeply, though no words had been spoken openly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Go now! ' said Celeborn. 'You are worn with sorrow and much toil. Even<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">if your Quest did not concern us closely, you should have refuge in this<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">City, until you were healed and refreshed. Now you shall rest, and we will<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">not speak of your further road for a while.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">That night the Company slept upon the ground, much to the satisfaction<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of the hobbits. The Elves spread for them a pavilion among the trees near<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the fountain, and in it they laid soft couches; then speaking words of peace<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with fair elvish voices they left them. For a little while the travellers<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">talked of their night before in the tree-tops, and of their day's journey,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and of the Lord and Lady; for they had not yet the heart to look further<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">back.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'What did you blush for, Sam? â€™ said Pippin. 'You soon broke down.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Anyone would have thought you had a guilty conscience. I hope it was nothing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">worse than a wicked plot to steal one of my blankets.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I never thought no such thing,â€™ answered Sam, in no mood for jest. â€™If<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you want to know, I felt as if I hadnâ€™t got nothing on, and I didn't like<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it. She seemed to be looking inside me and asking me what I would do if she<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">gave me the chance of flying back home to the Shire to a nice little hole<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with-with a bit of garden of my own.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'That's funny,' said Merry. 'Almost exactly what I felt myself; only,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">only well, I don't think I'll say any more,' he ended lamely.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">All of them, it seemed, had fared alike: each had felt that he was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">offered a choice between a shadow full of fear that lay ahead, and something<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that he greatly desired: clear before his mind it lay, and to get it he had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">only to turn aside from the road and leave the Quest and the war against<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sauron to others.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'And it seemed to me, too,' said Gimli, 'that my choice would remain<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">secret and known only to myself.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'To me it seemed exceedingly strange,' said Boromir. 'Maybe it was only<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a test, and she thought to read our thoughts for her own good purpose; but<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">almost I should have said that she was tempting us, and offering what she<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">pretended to have the power to give. It need not be said that I refused to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">listen. The Men of Minas Tirith are true to their word.â€™ But what he thought<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that the Lady had offered him Boromir did not tell.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And as for Frodo, he would not speak, though Boromir pressed him with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">questions. 'She held you long in her gaze, Ring -bearer,â€™ he said.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Yes,' said Frodo; 'but whatever came into my mind then I will keep<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">there.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well, have a care! 'said Boromir. 'I do not feel too sure of this<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Elvish Lady and her purposes.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Speak no evil of the Lady Galadriel! ' said Aragorn sternly. 'You know<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">not what you say. There is in her and in this land no evil, unless a man<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">bring it hither himself . Then let him beware ! But tonight I shall sleep<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">without fear for the first time since I left Rivendell. And may I sleep<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">deep, and forget for a while my grief! I am weary in body and in heart.' He<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">cast himself down upon his couch and fell at once into a long sleep.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The others soon did the same, and no sound or dream disturbed their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">slumber. When they woke they found that the light of day was broad upon the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">lawn before the pavilion, and the fountain rose and fell glittering in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sun.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They remained some days in Lothlurien, so far as they could tell or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">remember. All the while that they dwelt there the sun shone clear, save for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a gentle rain that fell at times, and passed away leaving all things fresh<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and clean. The air was cool and soft, as if it were early spring, yet they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">felt about them the deep and thoughtful quiet of winter. It seemed to them<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that they did little but eat and drink and rest, and walk among the trees;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and it was enough.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They had not seen the Lord and Lady again, and they had little speech<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with the Elven-folk; for few of these knew or would use the Westron tongue.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Haldir had bidden them farewell and gone back again to the fences of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">North, where great watch was now kept since the tidings of Moria that the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Company had brought. Legolas was away much among the Galadhrim, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">after<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the first night he did not sleep with the other companions, though he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">returned to eat and talk with them. Often he took Gimli with him when he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">went abroad in the land, and the others wondered at this change.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Now as the companions sat or walked together they spoke of Gandalf, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">all that each had known and seen of him came clear before their minds. As<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they were healed of hurt and weariness of body the grief of their loss grew<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">more keen. Often they heard nearby Elvish voices singing, and knew that they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were making songs of lamentation for his fall, for they caught his name<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">among the sweet sad words that they could not understand.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mithrandir, Mithrandir sang the Elves, O Pilgrim Grey! For so they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">loved to call him. But if Legolas was with the Company, he would not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">interpret the songs for them, saying that he had not the skill, and that for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">him the grief was still too near, a matter for tears and not yet for song.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It was Frodo who first put something of his sorrow into halting words.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He was seldom moved to make song or rhyme; even in Ri vendell he had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">listened<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and had not sung himself, though his memory was stored with many things that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">others had made before him. But now as he sat beside the fountain in Lurien<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and heard about him the voices of the Elves, his thought took shape in a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">song that seemed fair to him; yet when he tried to repeat it to Sam only<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">snatches remained, faded as a handful of withered leaves.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">When evening in the Shire was grey<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his footsteps on the Hill were heard;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">before the dawn he went away<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">on journey long without a word.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">From Wilderland to Western shore,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">from northern waste to southern hill,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">through dragon-lair and hidden door<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">With Dwarf and Hobbit, Elves and Men,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with bird on bough and beast in den,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in their own secret tongues he spoke.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A deadly sword, a healing hand,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a trumpet-voice, a burning brand,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a weary pilgrim on the road.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">A lord of wisdom throned he sat,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">swift in anger, quick to laugh;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">an old man in a battered hat<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He stood upon the bridge alone<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his staff was broken on the stone,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Why, you'll be beating Mr. Bilbo next! ' said Sam.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'No, I am afraid not,' said Frodo. 'But that is the best I can do yet.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well, Mr. Frodo, if you do have another go, I hope you'll say a word<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">about his fireworks,' said Sam. 'Something like this:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The finest rockets ever seen:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they burst in stars of blue and green,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">or after thunder golden showers<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">came falling like a rain of flowers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Though that doesn't do them justice by a long road.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'No, I'll leave that to you, Sam. Or perhaps to Bilbo. But-well. I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">can't talk of it any more. I can't bear to think of bringing the news to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">him.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">One evening Frodo and Sam were walking together in the cool twilight.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Both of them felt restless again. On Frodo suddenly the shadow of parting<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">had fallen: he knew somehow that the time was very near when he must leave<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Lothlurien.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'What do you think of Elves now, Sam? â€™ he said. 'I asked you the same<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">question once before-it seems a very long while ago; but you have seen more<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of them since then.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I have indeed! ' said Sam. 'And I reckon there's Elves and Elves.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They're all elvish enough, but they're not all the same. Now these folk<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">aren't wanderers or homeless, and seem a bit nearer to the likes of us: they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">seem to belong here, more even than Flobbits do in the Shire. Whether they've<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">made the land, or the land's made them, it's hard to say, if you take my<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">meaning. It's wonderfully quiet here. Nothing seems to be going on, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">nobody seems to want it to. If there's any magic about, it's right down<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">deep, where I can't lay my hands on it, in a manner of speaking.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You can see and feel it everywhere,' said Frodo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well,' said Sam, 'you can't see nobody working it. No fireworks like<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">poor Gandalf used to show. I wonder we don't see nothing of the Lord and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Lady in all these days. I fancy now that she could do some wonderful things,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">if she had a mind. I'd dearly love to see some Elf-magic, Mr. Frodo! '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I wouldn't,' said Frodo. 'I am content. And I don't miss Gandalf's<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fireworks, but his bushy eyebrows, and his quick temper, and his voice.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You're right,' said Sam. 'And don't think I'm finding fault. I've<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">often wanted to see a bit of magic like what it tells of in old tales, but<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I've never heard of a better land than this. It's like being at home and on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a holiday at the same time, if you understand me. I don't want to leave. All<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the same, I'm beginning to feel that if weâ€™ve got to go on, then we'd best<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">get it over.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'It's the job that's never started as takes longest to finish, as my<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">old gaffer used to say. And I don't reckon that these folk can do much more<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to help us, magic or no. It's when we leave this land that we shall miss<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gandalf worse, I'm thinking.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I am afraid that's only too true, Sam,' said Frodo. 'Yet I hope very<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">much that before we leave we shall see the Lady of the Elves again.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Even as he spoke, they saw, as if she came in answer to their words,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Lady Galadriel approaching. Tall and white and fair she walked beneath<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the trees. She spoke no word, but beckoned to them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Turning aside, she led them toward the southern slopes of the hill of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Caras Galadhon, and passing through a high green hedge they came into an<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">enclosed garden. No trees grew there, and it lay open to the sky. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">evening star had risen and was shining with white fire above the western<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">woods. Down a long flight of steps the Lady went into a deep green hollow,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">through which ran murmuring the silver stream that issued from the fountain<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">on the hill. At the bottom, upon a low pedestal carved like a branching<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">tree, stood a basin of silver, wide and shallow, and beside it stood a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">silver ewer.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">With water from the stream Galadriel filled the basin to the brim, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">breathed on it, and when the water was still again she spoke. 'Here is the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mirror of Galadriel,â€™ she said. â€™I have brought you here so that you may<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">look in it, if you will.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The air was very still, and the dell was dark, and the Elf-lady beside<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">him was tall and pale. 'What shall we look for, and what shall we see? '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">asked Frodo, filled with awe.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Many things I can command the Mirror to reveal,' she answered, 'and to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">some I can show what they desire to see. But the Mirror will also show<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">things unbidden, and those are often stranger and more profitable than<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">things which we wish to behold. What you will see, if you leave the Mirror<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">free to work, I cannot tell. For it shows things that were, and things that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">are, things that yet may be. But which it is that he sees, even the wisest<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">cannot always tell. Do you wish to look? '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo did not answer.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'And you? â€™ she said, turning to Sam. 'For this is what your folk would<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">call magic. I believe; though I do not understand clearly what they mean;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and they seem also to use the same word of the deceits of the Enemy. But<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">this, if you will, is the magic of Galadriel. Did you not say that you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wished to see Elf-magic? '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I did,' said Sam, trembling a little between fear and curiosity. Til<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">have a peep, Lady, if you're willing.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'And I'd not mind a glimpse of what's going on at home,' he said in an<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">aside to Frodo. 'It seems a terrible long time that I've been away. But<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">there, like as not I'll only see the stars, or something that I won't<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">understand.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Like as not,' said the Lady with a gentle laugh. 'But come, you shall<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">look and see what you may. Do not touch the water! â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sam climbed up on the foot of the pedestal and leaned over the basin.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The water looked hard and dark. Stars were reflected in it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'There's only stars, as I thought,' he said. Then he gave a low gasp,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">for the stars went out. As if a dark veil had been withdrawn, the Mirror<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">grew grey, and then clear. There was sun shining, and the branches of trees<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were waving and tossing in the wind. But before Sam could make up his mind<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">what it was that he saw, the light faded; and now he thought he saw Frodo<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with a pale face lying fast asleep under a great dark cliff. Then he seemed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to see himself going along a dim passage, and climbing an endless winding<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stair. It came to him suddenly that he was looking urgently for something,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">but what it was he did not know. Like a dream the vision shifted and went<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">back, and he saw the trees again. But this time they were not so close, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he could see what was going on: they were not waving in the wind, they were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">falling, crashing to the ground.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Hi!' cried Sam in an outraged voice. 'There's that Ted Sandyman<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a-cutting down trees as he shouldn't. They didn't ought to be felled: it's<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that avenue beyond the Mill that shades the road to Bywater. I wish I could<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">get at Ted, and I'd fell himV<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But now Sam noticed that the Old Mill had vanished, and a large<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">red-brick building was being put up where it had stood. Lots of folk were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">busily at work. There was a tall red chimney nearby. Black smoke seemed to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">cloud the surface of the Mirror.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'There's some devilry at work in the Shire,' he said. 'Elrond knew what<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he was about when he wanted to send Mr. Merry back.' Then suddenly Sam<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">gave<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a cry and sprang away. 'I can't stay here,' he said wildly. 'I must go home.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Theyâ€™ve dug up Bagshot Row, and there's the poor old gaffer going down the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Hill with his bits of things on a barrow. I must go home! â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™You cannot go home alone,â€™ said the Lady. â€™You did not wish to go home<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">without your master before you looked in the Mirror, and yet you knew that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">evil things might well be happening in the Shire. Remember that the Mirror<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shows many things, and not all have yet come to pass. Some never come to be,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">unless those that behold the visions turn aside from their path to prevent<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">them. The Mirror is dangerous as a guide of deeds.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sam sat on the ground and put his head in his hands. 'I wish I had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">never come here, and I donâ€™t want to see no more magic,â€™ he said and fell<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">silent. After a moment he spoke again thickly, as if struggling with tears.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'No, Iâ€™ll go home by the long road with Mr. Frodo, or not at all,â€™ he said.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'But I hope I do get back some day. If what Iâ€™ve seen turns out true,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">somebodyâ€™s going to catch it hot! â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Do you now wish to look, Frodo? â€™ said the Lady Galadriel. 'You did<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">not wish to see Elf-magic and were content.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Do you advise me to look? â€™ asked Frodo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™No,â€™ she said. 'I do not counsel you one way or the other. I am not a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">counsellor. You may learn something, and whether what you see be fair or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">evil, that may be profitable, and yet it may not. Seeing is both good and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">perilous. Yet I think, Frodo, that you have courage and wisdom enough for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the venture, or I would not have brought you here. Do as you will! â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I will look,â€™ said Frodo, and he climbed on the pedestal and bent over<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the dark water. At once the Mirror cleared and he saw a twilit land.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mountains loomed dark in the distance against a pale sky. A long grey road<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wound back out of sight. Far away a figure came slowly down the road, faint<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and small at first, but growing larger and clearer as it approached.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Suddenly Frodo realized that it reminded him of Gandalf. He almost called<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">aloud the wizardâ€™s name, and then he saw that the figure was clothed not in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">grey but in white, in a white that shone faintly in the dusk; and in its<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hand there was a white staff. The head was so bowed that he could see no<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">face, and presently the figure turned aside round a bend in the road and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">went out of the Mirror's view. Doubt came into Frodo's mind: was this a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">vision of Gandalf on one of his many lonely journeys long ago, or was it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Saruman?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The vision now changed. Brief and small but very vivid he caught a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">glimpse of Bilbo walking restlessly about his room. The table was littered<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with disordered papers; rain was beating on the windows.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Then there was a pause, and after it many swift scenes followed that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo in some way knew to be parts of a great history in which he had become<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">involved. The mist cleared and he saw a sight which he had never seen before<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">but knew at once: the Sea. Darkness fell. The sea rose and raged in a great<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">storm. Then he saw against the Sun, sinking blood-red into a wrack of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">clouds, the black outline of a tall ship with torn sails riding up out of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the West. Then a wide river flowing through a populous city. Then a white<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fortress with seven towers. And then again a ship with black sails, but now<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it was morning again, and the water rippled with light, and a banner bearing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the emblem of a white tree shone in the sun. A smoke as of fire and battle<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">arose, and again the sun went down in a burning red that faded into a grey<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mist; and into the mist a small ship passed away, twinkling with lights. It<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">vanished, and Frodo sighed and prepared to draw away.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But suddenly the Mirror went altogether dark, as dark as if a hole had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">opened in the world of sight, and Frodo looked into emptiness. In the black<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">abyss there appeared a single Eye that slowly grew, until it filled nearly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">all the Mirror. So terrible was it that Frodo stood rooted, unable to cry<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">out or to withdraw his gaze. The Eye was rimmed with fire, but was itself<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">glazed, yellow as a cat's, watchful and intent, and the black slit of its<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">pupil opened on a pit, a window into nothing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Then the Eye began to rove, searching this way and that; and Frodo knew<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with certainty and horror that among the many things that it sought he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">himself was one. But he also knew that it could not see him-not yet, not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">unless he willed it. The Ring that hung upon its chain about his neck grew<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">heavy, heavier than a great stone, and his head was dragged downwards. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mirror seemed to be growing hot and curls of steam were rising from the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">water. He was slipping forward.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Do not touch the water!' said the Lady Galadriel softly. The vision<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">faded, and Frodo found that he was looking at the cool stars twinkling in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the silver basin. He stepped back shaking all over and looked at the Lady.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">V I know what it was that you last saw,' she said; 'for that is also in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">my mind. Do not be afraid! But do not think that only by singing amid the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">trees, nor even by the slender arrows of elven-bows, is this land of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Lothlurien maintained and defended against its Enemy. I say to you, Frodo,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that even as I speak to you, I perceive the Dark Lord and know his mind, or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">all of his mind that concerns the Elves. And he gropes ever to see me and my<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">thought. But still the door is closed! '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">She lifted up her white arms, and spread out her hands towards the East<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in a gesture of rejection and denial. Edrendil, the Evening Star, most<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">beloved of the Elves, shone clear above. So bright was it that the figure of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Elven-lady cast a dim shadow on the ground. Its rays glanced upon a ring<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">about her finger; it glittered like polished gold overlaid with silver<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">light, and a white stone in it twinkled as if the Even-star had come down to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">rest upon her hand. Frodo gazed at the ring with awe; for suddenly it seemed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to him that he understood.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Yes,' she said, divining his thought, 'it is not permitted to speak of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it, and Elrond could not do so. But it cannot be hidden from the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Ring -bearer, and one who has seen the Eye. Verily it is in the land of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Lurien upon the finger of Galadriel that one of the Three remains. This is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Nenya, the Ring of Adamant, and I am its keeper.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'He suspects, but he does not know â€” not yet. Do you not see now<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wherefore your coming is to us as the footstep of Doom? For if you fail,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">then we are laid bare to the Enemy. Yet if you succeed, then our power is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">diminished, and Lothlurien will fade, and the tides of Time will sweep it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">away. We must depart into the West, or dwindle to a rustic folk of dell and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">cave, slowly to forget and to be forgotten.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo bent his head. 'And what do you wish? ' he said at last.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'That what should be shall be,â€™ she answered. 'The love of the Elves<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">for their land and their works is deeper than the deeps of the Sea, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">their regret is undying and cannot ever wholly be assuaged. Yet they will<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">cast all away rather than submit to Sauron: for they know him now. For the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fate of Lothlurien you are not answerable but only for the doing of your own<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">task. Yet I could wish, were it of any avail, that the One Ring had never<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">been wrought, or had remained for ever lost.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You are wise and fearless and fair, Lady Galadriel,' said Frodo. 'I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">will give you the One Ring, if you ask for it. It is too great a matter for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">me.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Galadriel laughed with a sudden clear laugh. 'Wise the Lady Galadriel<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">may be,' she said, 'yet here she has met her match in courtesy. Gently are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you revenged for my testing of your heart at our first meeting. You begin to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">see with a keen eye. I do not deny that my heart has greatly desired to ask<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">what you offer. For many long years I had pondered what I might do, should<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Great Ring come into my hands, and behold! it was brought within my<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">grasp. The evil that was devised long ago works on in many ways, whether<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sauron himself stands or falls. Would not that have been a noble deed to set<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to the credit of his Ring, if I had taken it by force or fear from my guest?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'And now at last it comes. You will give me the Ring freely! In place<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of the Dark Lord you will set up a Queen. And I shall not be dark, but<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">beautiful and terrible as the Morning and the Night! Fair as the Sea and the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sun and the Snow upon the Mountain! Dreadful as the Storm and the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Lightning !<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Stronger than the foundations of the earth. All shall love me and despair! '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">She lifted up her hand and from the ring that she wore there issued a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">great light that illuminated her alone and left all else dark. She stood<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">before Frodo seeming now tall beyond measurement, and beautiful beyond<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">enduring, terrible and worshipful. Then she let her hand fall, and the light<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">faded, and suddenly she laughed again, and lo! she was shrunken: a slender<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">elf-woman, clad in simple white, whose gentle voice was soft and sad.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I pass the test,' she said. 'I will diminish, and go into the West and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">remain Galadriel.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They stood for a long while in silence. At length the Lady spoke again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Let us return! ' she said. 'In the morning you must depart for now we have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">chosen, and the tides of fate are flowing.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I would ask one thing before we go,' said Frodo, 'a thing which I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">often meant to ask Gandalf in Rivendell. I am permitted to wear the One<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Ring: why cannot I see all the others and know the thoughts of those that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wear them? â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You have not tried,â€™ she said. 'Only thrice have you set the Ring upon<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">your finger since you knew what you possessed. Do not try! It would destroy<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you. Did not Gandalf tell you that the rings give power according to the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">measure of each possessor? Before you could use that power you would need<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">become far stronger, and to train your will to the domination of others. Yet<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">even so, as Ring-bearer and as one that has borne it on finger and seen that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">which is hidden, your sight is grown keener. You have perceived my thought<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">more clearly than many that are accounted wise. You saw the Eye of him that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">upon my finger? Did you see my ring? â€™ she asked turning again to Sam.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'No, Lady,' he answered. 'To tell you the truth, I wondered what you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were talking about. I saw a star through your finger. But if you'll pardon<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">my speaking out, I think my master was right. I wish you'd take his Ring.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">You'd put things to rights. You'd stop them digging up the gaffer and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">turning him adrift. You'd make some folk pay for their dirty work.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I would,' she said. 'That is how it would begin. But it would not stop<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with that, alas! We will not speak more of it. Let us go!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">That night the Company was again summoned to the chamber of Celeborn,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and there the Lord and Lady greeted them with fair words. At length Celeborn<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">spoke of their departure.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Now is the time,' he said, 'when those who wish to continue the Quest<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">must harden their hearts to leave this land. Those who no longer wish to go<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">forward may remain here, for a while. But whether they stay or go, none can<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">be sure of peace. For we are come now to the edge of doom. Here those who<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wish may await the oncoming of the hour till either the ways of the world<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">lie open again, or we summon them to the last need of Lurien. Then they may<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">return to their own lands, or else go to the long home of those that fall in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">battle.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There was a silence. 'They all resolved to go forward,â€™ said Galadriel<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">looking in their eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'As for me,â€™ said Boromir, 'my way home lies onward and not back.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'That is true,â€™ said Celeborn, 'but is all this Company going with you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to Minas Tirith? â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'We have not decided our course,â€™ said Aragorn. â€™Beyond Lothlurien I do<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">not know what Gandalf intended to do. Indeed I do not think that even he had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">any clear purpose.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Maybe not,â€™ said Celeborn, 'yet when you leave this land, you can no<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">longer forget the Great River. As some of you know well, it cannot be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">crossed by travellers with baggage between Lurien and Gondor, save by boat.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And are not the bridges of Osgiliath broken down and all the landings held<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">now by the Enemy?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'On which side will you journey? The way to Minas Tirith lies upon this<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">side, upon the west; but the straight road of the Quest lies east of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">River, upon the darker shore. Which shore will you now take? â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'If my advice is heeded, it will be the western shore, and the way to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Minas Tirith,â€™ answered Boromir. 'But I am not the leader of the Company.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The others said nothing, and Aragorn looked doubtful and troubled.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I see that you do not yet know what to do,â€™ said Celeborn. 'It is not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">my part to choose for you; but I will help you as I may. There are some<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">among you who can handle boats: Legolas, whose folk know the swift Forest<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">River; and Boromir of Gondor; and Aragorn the traveller.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'And one Hobbit! ' cried Merry. 'Not all of us look on boats as wild<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">horses. My people live by the banks of the Brandywine.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'That is well,â€™ said Celeborn. 'Then I will furnish your Company with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">boats. They must be small and light, for if you go far by water, there are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">places where you will be forced to carry them. You will come to the rapids<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of Sarn Gebir, and maybe at last to the great falls of Rauros where the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">River thunders down from Nen Hithoel; and there are other perils. Boats may<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">make your journey less toilsome for awhile. Yet they will not give you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">counsel: in the end you must leave them and the River, and turn west-or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">east.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Aragorn thanked Celeborn many times. The gift of boats comforted him<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">much, not least because there would now be no need to decide his course for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">some days. The others, too, looked more hopeful. Whatever perils lay ahead,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it seemed better to float down the broad tide of Anduin to meet them than to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">plod forward with bent backs. Only Sam was doubtful: he at any rate still<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">thought boats as bad as wild horses, or worse, and not all the dangers that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he had survived made him think better of them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'All shall be prepared for you and await you at the haven before noon<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">tomorrow,' said Celeborn. 'I will send my people to you in the morning to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">help you make ready for the journey. Now we will wish you all a fair night<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and untroubled sleep.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Good night, my friends! ' said Galadriel. 'Sleep in peace! Do not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">trouble your hearts overmuch with thought of the road tonight. Maybe the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">paths that you each shall tread are already laid before your feet, though<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you do not see them. Good night! '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Company now took their leave and returned to their pavilion.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Legolas went with them, for this was to be their last night in Lothlurien,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and in spite of the words of Galadriel they wished to take counsel together.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For a long time they debated what they should do, and how it would be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">best to attempt the fulfilling of their purpose with the Ring: but they came<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to no decision. It was plain that most of them desired to go first to Minas<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Tirith, and to escape at least for a while from the terror of the Enemy.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They would have been willing to follow a leader over the River and into the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shadow of Mordor; but Frodo spoke no word, and Aragorn was still divided in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his mind.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">His own plan, while Gandalf remained with them, had been to go with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Boromir, and with his sword help to deliver Gondor. For he believed that the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">message of the dreams was a summons, and that the hour had come at last<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">when<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the heir of Elendil should come forth and strive with Sauron for the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mastery. But in Moria the burden of Gandalf had been laid on him; and he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">knew that he could not now forsake the Ring, if Frodo refused in the end to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">go with Boromir. And yet what help could he or any of the Company give to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo, save to walk blindly with him into the darkness?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I shall go to Minas Tirith, alone if need be, for it is my duty,' said<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Boromir; and after that he was silent for a while, sitting with his eyes<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fixed on Frodo, as if he was trying to read the Halflingâ€™s thoughts. At<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">length he spoke again, softly, as if he was debating with himself. 'If you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wish only to destroy the Ring,â€™ he said, "then there is little use in war<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and weapons; and the Men of Minas Tirith cannot help. But if you wish to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">destroy the armed might of the Dark Lord, then it is folly to go without<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">force into his domain; and folly to throw away.' He paused suddenly, as if<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he had become aware that he was speaking his thoughts aloud. 'It would be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">folly to throw lives away, I mean,' he ended. 'It is a choice between<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">defending a strong place and walking openly into the arms of death. At<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">least, that is how I see it.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo caught something new and strange in Boromir's glance, and he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">looked hard at him. Plainly Boromir's thought was different from his final<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">words. It would be folly to throw away: what? The Ring of Power? He had said<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">something like this at the Council, but then he had accepted the correction<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of Elrond. Frodo looked at Aragorn, but he seemed deep in his own thought<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and made no sign that he had heeded Boromir's words. And so their debate<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ended. Merry and Pippin were already asleep, and Sam was nodding. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">night<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was growing old.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the morning, as they were beginning to pack their slender goods,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Elves that could speak their tongue came to them and brought them many gifts<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of food and clothing for the journey. The food was mostly in the form of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">very thin cakes, made of a meal that was baked a light brown on the outside,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and inside was the colour of cream. Gimli took up one of the cakes and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">looked at it with a doubtful eye.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Cram,' he said under his breath, as he broke off a crisp corner and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">nibbled at it. His expression quickly changed, and he ate all the rest of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the cake with relish.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'No more, no more!' cried the Elves laughing. 'You have eaten enough<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">already for a long dayâ€™s march.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I thought it was only a kind of cram , such as the Dale-men make for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">journeys in the wild,â€™ said the Dwarf.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'So it is,â€™ they answered. 'But we call it lembas or waybread, and it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">is more strengthening than any food made by Men, and it is more pleasant<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">than cram, by all accounts.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Indeed it is,â€™ said Gimli. â€™Why it is better than the honey-cakes of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Beornings, and that is great praise, for the Beornings are the best<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">bakers that I know of; but they are none too willing to deal out their cakes<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to travellers in these days. You are kindly hosts! â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™All the same, we bid you spare the food,â€™ they said. â€™Eat little at a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">time, and only at need. For these things are given to serve you when all<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">else fails. The cakes will keep sweet for many many days, if they are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">unbroken and left in their leaf- wrappings, as we have brought them. One will<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">keep a traveller on his feet for a day of long labour, even if he be one of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the tall Men of Minas Tirith.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Elves next unwrapped and gave to each of the Company the clothes<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they had brought. For each they had provided a hood and cloak, made<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">according to his size, of the light but warm silken stuff that the Galadhrim<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wove. It was hard to say of what colour they were: grey with the hue of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">twilight under the trees they seemed to be; and yet if they were moved, or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">set in another light, they were green as shadowed leaves, or brown as fallow<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fields by night, dusk-silver as water under the stars. Each cloak was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fastened about the neck with a brooch like a green leaf veined with silver.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Are these magic cloaks? â€™ asked Pippin, looking at them with wonder.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I do not know what you mean by that,â€™ answered the leader of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Elves. 'They are fair garments, and the web is good, for it was made in this<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">land. They are elvish robes certainly, if that is what you mean. Leaf and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">branch, water and stone: they have the hue and beauty of all these things<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">under the twilight of Lurien that we love; for we put the thought of all<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that we love into all that we make. Yet they are garments, not armour, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they will not turn shaft or blade. But they should serve you well: they are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">light to wear, and warm enough or cool enough at need. And you will find<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">them a great aid in keeping out of the sight of unfriendly eyes, whether you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">walk among the stones or the trees. You are indeed high in the favour of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Lady! For she herself and her maidens wove this stuff; and never before have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">we clad strangers in the garb of our own people.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After their morning meal the Company said farewell to the lawn by the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fountain. Their hearts were heavy; for it was a fair place, and it had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">become like home to them, though they could not count the days and nights<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that they had passed there. As they stood for a moment looking at the white<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">water in the sunlight, Haldir came walking towards them over the green grass<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of the glade. Frodo greeted him with delight.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I have returned from the Northern Fences,' said the Elf, 'and I am<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sent now to be your guide again. The Dimrill Dale is full of vapour and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">clouds of smoke, and the mountains are troubled. There are noises in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">deeps of the earth. If any of you had thought of returning northwards to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">your homes, you would not have been able to pass that way. But come! Your<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">path now goes south.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As they walked through Caras Galadhon the green ways were empty; but in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the trees above them many voices were murmuring and singing. They<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">themselves<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">went silently. At last Haldir led them down the southward slopes of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hill, and they came again to the great gate hung with lamps, and to the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">white bridge; and so they passed out and left the city of the Elves. Then<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they turned away from the paved road and took a path that went off into a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">deep thicket of mallorn-trees, and passed on, winding through rolling<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">woodlands of silver shadow, leading them ever down, southwards and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">eastwards, towards the shores of the River.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They had gone some ten miles and noon was at hand when they came on a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">high green wall. Passing through an opening they came suddenly out of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">trees. Before them lay a long lawn of shining grass, studded with golden<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">elanor that glinted in the sun. The lawn ran out into a narrow tongue<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">between bright margins: on the right and west the Silverlode flowed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">glittering; on the left and east the Great River rolled its broad waters,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">deep and dark. On the further shores the woodlands still marched on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">southwards as far as the eye could see, but all the banks were bleak and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">bare. No mallorn lifted its gold-hung boughs beyond the Land of Lurien.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">On the bank of the Silverlode, at some distance up from the meeting of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the streams, there was a hythe of white stones and white wood. By it were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">moored many boats and barges. Some were brightly painted, and shone with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">silver and gold and green, but most were either white or grey. Three small<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">grey boats had been made ready for the travellers, and in these the Elves<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stowed their goods. And they added also coils of rope, three to each boat.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Slender they looked, but strong, silken to the touch, grey of hue like the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">elven-cloaks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'What are these? ' asked Sam, handling one that lay upon the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">greensward.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Ropes indeed! ' answered an Elf from the boats. 'Never travel far<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">without a rope! And one that is long and strong and light. Such are these.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They may be a help in many needs.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You don't need to tell me that! ' said Sam. I came without any and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I've been worried ever since. But I was wondering what these were made of,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">knowing a bit about rope -making: it's in the family as you might say.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'They are made of hithlain,' said the Elf, 'but there is no time now to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">instruct you in the art of their making. Had we known that this craft<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">delighted you, we could have taught you much. But now alas! unless you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">should at some time return hither, you must be content with our gift. May it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">serve you well ! '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Come! ' said Haldir. 'All is now ready for you. Enter the boats! But<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">take care at first! â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Heed the words! ' said the other Elves. 'These boats are light-built,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and they are crafty and unlike the boats of other folk. They will not sink,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">lade them as you will; but they are wayward if mishandled. It would be wise<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">if you accustomed yourselves to stepping in and out, here where there is a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">landing-place, before you set off downstream.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Company was arranged in this way: Aragorn, Frodo, and Sam were in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">one boat; Boromir, Merry, and Pippin in another; and in the third were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Legolas and Gimli, who had now become fast friends. In this last boat most<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of the goods and packs were stowed. The boats were moved and steered with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">short-handled paddles that had broad leaf-shaped blades. When all was ready<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Aragorn led them on a trial up the Silverlode. The current was swift and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they went forward slowly. Sam sat in the bows, clutching the sides, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">looking back wistfully to the shore. The sunlight glittering on the water<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dazzled his eyes. As they passed beyond the green field of the Tongue, the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">trees drew down to the river's brink. Here and there golden leaves tossed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and floated on the rippling stream. The air was very bright and still, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">there was a silence, except for the high distant song of larks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They turned a sharp bend in the river, and there, sailing proudly down<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the stream toward them, they saw a swan of great size. The water rippled on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">either side of the white breast beneath its curving neck. Its beak shone<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">like burnished gold, and its eyes glinted like jet set in yellow stones; its<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">huge white wings were half lifted. A music came down the river as it drew<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">nearer; and suddenly they perceived that it was a ship, wrought and carved<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with elven-skill in the likeness of a bird. Two elves clad in white steered<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it with black paddles. In the midst of the vessel sat Celeborn, and behind<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">him stood Galadriel, tall and white; a circlet of golden flowers was in her<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hair, and in her hand she held a harp, and she sang. Sad and sweet was the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sound of her voice in the cool clear air:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I sang of leaves, of leaves of gold, and leaves of gold there grew:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Of wind I sang, a wind there came and in the branches blew.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Beyond the Sun, beyond the Moon, the foam was on the Sea,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And by the strand of Ilmarin there grew a golden Tree.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Beneath the stars of Ever-eve in Eldamar it shone,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In Eldamar beside the walls of Elven Tirion.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There long the golden leaves have grown upon the branching years,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">While here beyond the Sundering Seas now fall the Elven-tears.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">O Lurien! The Winter comes, the bare and leafless Day;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The leaves are falling in the stream, the River flows away.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">O Lurien! Too long I have dwelt upon this Hither Shore<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And in a fading crown have twined the golden elanor.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But if of ships I now should sing, what ship would come to me,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">What ship would bear me ever back across so wide a Sea?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Aragorn stayed his boat as the Swan-ship drew alongside. The Lady ended<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">her song and greeted them. 'We have come to bid you our last farewell,' she<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">said, 'and to speed you with blessings from our land.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Though you have been our guests,â€™ said Celeborn, 'you have not yet<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">eaten with us, and we bid you, therefore, to a parting feast, here between<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the flowing waters that will bear you far from Lurien.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Swan passed on slowly to the hythe, and they turned their boats and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">followed it. There in the last end of Egladil upon the green grass the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">parting feast was held; but Frodo ate and drank little, heeding only the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">beauty of the Lady and her voice. She seemed no longer perilous or terrible,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">nor filled with hidden power. Already she seemed to him, as by men of later<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">days Elves still at times are seen: present and yet remote, a living vision<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of that which has already been left far behind by the flowing streams of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Time.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After they had eaten and drunk, sitting upon the grass, Celeborn spoke<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to them again of their journey, and lifting his hand he pointed south to the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">woods beyond the Tongue.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'As you go down the water,' he said, 'you will find that the trees will<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fail, and you will come to a barren country. There the River flows in stony<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">vale amid high moors, until at last after many leagues it comes to the tall<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">island of the Tindrock, that we call Tol Brandir. There it casts its arms<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">about the steep shores of the isle, and falls then with a great noise and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">smoke over the cataracts of Rauros down into the Nindalf, the Wetwang as it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">is called in your tongue. That is a wide region of sluggish fen where the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stream becomes tortuous and much divided. There the Entwash flows in by<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">many<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mouths from the Forest of Fangorn in the west. About that stream, on this<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">side of the Great River, lies Rohan. On the further side are the bleak hills<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of the Emyn Muil. The wind blows from the East there, for they look out over<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Dead Marshes and the Noman-lands to Cirith Gorgor and the black gates of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Boromir, and any that go with him seeking Minas Tirith, will do well<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to leave the Great River above Rauros and cross the Entwash before it finds<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the marshes. Yet they should not go too far up that stream, nor risk<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">becoming entangled in the Forest of Fangorn. That is a strange land, and is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">now little known. But Boromir and Aragorn doubtless do not need this<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">warning.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Indeed we have heard of Fangorn in Minas Tirith,' said Boromir. 'But<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">what I have heard seems to me for the most part old wives' tales, such as we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">tell to our children. All that lies north of Rohan is now to us so far away<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that fancy can wander freely there. Of old Fangorn lay upon the borders of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">our realm; but it is now many lives of men since any of us visited it, to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">prove or disprove the legends that have come down from distant years.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I have myself been at whiles in Rohan, but I have never crossed it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">northwards. When I was sent out as a messenger, I passed through the Gap by<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the skirts of the White Mountains, and crossed the Isen and the Grey flood<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">into Northerland. A long and wearisome journey. Four hundred leagues I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">reckoned it, and it took me many months; for I lost my horse at Tharbad, at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the fording of the Greyflood. After that journey, and the road I have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">trodden with this Company, I do not much doubt that I shall find a way<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">through Rohan, and Fangorn too, if need be.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Then I need say no more,' said Celeborn. 'But do not despise the lore<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that has come down from distant years; for oft it may chance that old wives<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">keep in memory word of things that once were needful for the wise to know.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Now Galadriel rose from the grass, and taking a cup from one of her<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">maidens she filled it with white mead and gave it to Celeborn.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Now it is time to drink the cup of farewell,' she said. 'Drink, Lord<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of the Galadhrim! And let not your heart be sad though night must follow<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">noon, and already our evening draweth nigh.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Then she brought the cup to each of the Company, and bade them drink<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and farewell. But when they had drunk she commanded them to sit again on the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">grass, and chairs were set for her and for Celeborn. Her maidens stood<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">silent about her, and a while she looked upon her guests. At last she spoke<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'We have drunk the cup of parting,' she said, 'and the shadows fall<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">between us. But before you go, I have brought in my ship gifts which the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Lord and Lady of the Galadhrim now offer you in memory of Lothlurien.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Then<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">she called to each in turn.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Here is the gift of Celeborn and Galadriel to the leader of your<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Company,' she said to Aragorn, and she gave him a sheath that had been made<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to fit his sword. It was overlaid with a tracery of flowers and leaves<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wrought of silver and gold, and on it were set in elven runes formed of many<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">gems the name AndÂ®ril and the lineage of the sword.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'The blade that is drawn from this sheath shall not be stained or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">broken even in defeat,' she said. 'But is there aught else that you desire<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of me at our parting? For darkness will flow between us, and it may be that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">we shall not meet again, unless it be far hence upon a road that has no<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">returning.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And Aragorn answered: 'Lady, you know all my desire, and long held in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">keeping the only treasure that I seek. Yet it is not yours to give me, even<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">if you would; and only through darkness shall I come to it.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Yet maybe this will lighten your heart,' said Galadriel; 'for it was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">left in my care to be given to you, should you pass through this land.â€™ Then<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">she lifted from her lap a great stone of a clear green, set in a silver<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">brooch that was wrought in the likeness of an eagle with outspread wings;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and as she held it up the gem flashed like the sun shining through the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">leaves of spring. 'This stone I gave to Celebrnan my daughter, and she to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hers; and now it comes to you as a token of hope. In this hour take the name<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that was foretold for you, Elessar, the Elfstone of the house of Elendil! â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Then Aragorn took the stone and pinned the brooch upon his breast, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">those who saw him wondered; for they had not marked before how tall and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">kingly he stood, and it seemed to them that many years of toil had fallen<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">from his shoulders. 'For the gifts that you have given me I thank you,â€™ he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">said, 'O Lady of Lurien of whom were sprung Celebrnan and Arwen<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Evenstar.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">What praise could I say more? '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Lady bowed her head, and she turned then to Boromir, and to him she<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">gave a belt of gold; and to Merry and Pippin she gave small silver belts,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">each with a clasp wrought like a golden flower. To Legolas she gave a bow<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">such as the Galadhrim used, longer and stouter than the bows of Mirkwood,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and strung with a string of elf-hair. With it went a quiver of arrows.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'For you little gardener and lover of trees,' she said to Sam, 'I have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">only a small gift.â€™ She put into his hand a little box of plain grey wood,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">unadorned save for a single silver rune upon the lid. 'Here is set G for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Galadriel,' she said; 'but also it may stand for garden in your tongue. In<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">this box there is earth from my orchard, and such blessing as Galadriel has<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">still to bestow is upon it. It will not keep you on your road, nor defend<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you against any peril; but if you keep it and see your home again at last,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">then perhaps it may reward you. Though you should find all barren and laid<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">waste, there will be few gardens in Middle-earth that will bloom like your<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">garden, if you sprinkle this earth there. Then you may remember Galadriel,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and catch a glimpse far off of Lurien, that you have seen only in our<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">winter. For our spring and our summer are gone by, and they will never be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">seen on earth again save in memory.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sam went red to the ears and muttered something inaudible, as he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">clutched the box and bowed as well as he could.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'And what gift would a Dwarf ask of the Elves? ' said Galadriel turning<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to Gimli.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'None, Lady,â€™ answered Gimli. 'It is enough for me to have seen the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Lady of the Galadhrim, and to have heard her gentle words.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Hear all ye Elves! â€™ she cried to those about her. 'Let none say again<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that Dwarves are grasping and ungracious! Yet surely, Gimli son of Gluin,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you desire something that I could give? Name it, I bid you! You shall not be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the only guest without a gift.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'There is nothing, Lady Galadriel,' said Gimli, bowing low and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stammering. 'Nothing, unless it might be-unless it is permitted to ask. nay,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to name a single strand of your hair, which surpasses the gold of the earth<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">as the stars surpass the gems of the mine. I do not ask for such a gift. But<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you commanded me to name my desire.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Elves stirred and murmured with astonishment, and Celeborn gazed at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Dwarf in wonder, but the Lady smiled. â€™It is said that the skill of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Dwarves is in their hands rather than in their tongues â€™ she said; 'yet that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">is not true of Gimli. For none have ever made to me a request so bold and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">yet so courteous. And how shall I refuse, since I commanded him to speak?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But tell me, what would you do with such a gift? â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Treasure it, Lady,â€™ he answered, 'in memory of your words to me at our<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">first meeting. And if ever I return to the smithies of my home, it shall be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">set in imperishable crystal to be an heirloom of my house, and a pledge of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">good will between the Mountain and the Wood until the end of days.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Then the Lady unbraided one of her long tresses, and cut off three<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">golden hairs, and laid them in Gimliâ€™s hand. 'These words shall go with the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">gift,â€™ she said. 'I do not foretell, for all foretelling is now vain: on the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">one hand lies darkness, and on the other only hope. But if hope should not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fail, then I say to you, Gimli son of Gluin, that your hands shall flow with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">gold, and yet over you gold shall have no dominion.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'And you, Ring-bearer,â€™ she said, turning to Frodo. 'I come to you last<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">who are not last in my thoughts. For you I have prepared this.â€™ She held up<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a small crystal phial: it glittered as she moved it, and rays of white light<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sprang from her hand. â€™In this phial,â€™ she said, 'is caught the light of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Edrendilâ€™s star, set amid the waters of my fountain. It will shine still<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">brighter when night is about you. May it be a light to you in dark places,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">when all other lights go out. Remember Galadriel and her Mirror! â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo took the phial, and for a moment as it shone between them, he saw<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">her again standing like a queen, great and beautiful, but no longer<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">terrible. He bowed, but found no words to say.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Now the Lady arose, and Celeborn led them back to the hythe. A yellow<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">noon lay on the green land of the Tongue, and the water glittered with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">silver. All at last was made ready. The Company took their places in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">boats as before. Crying farewell, the Elves of Lurien with long grey poles<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">thrust them out into the flowing stream, and the rippling waters bore them<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">slowly away. The travellers sat still without moving or speaking. On the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">green bank near to the very point of the Tongue the Lady Galadriel stood<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">alone and silent. As they passed her they turned and their eyes watched her<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">slowly floating away from them. For so it seemed to them: Lurien was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">slipping backward, like a bright ship masted with enchanted trees, sailing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">on to forgotten shores, while they sat helpless upon the margin of the grey<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and leafless world.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Even as they gazed, the Silverlode passed out into the currents of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Great River, and their boats turned and began to speed southwards. Soon the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">white form of the Lady was small and distant. She shone like a window of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">glass upon a far hill in the westering sun, or as a remote lake seen from a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mountain: a crystal fallen in the lap of the land. Then it seemed to Frodo<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gimli wept openly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I have looked the last upon that which was fairest,' he said to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Fegolas his companion. 'Henceforward I will call nothing fair, unless it be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Tell me, Fegolas, why did I come on this Quest? Tittle did I know<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">where the chief peril lay! Truly Elrond spoke, saying that we could not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">foresee what we might meet upon our road. Torment in the dark was the danger<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that I feared, and it did not hold me back. But I would not have come, had I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">known the danger of light and joy. Now I have taken my worst wound in this<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">parting, even if I were to go this night straight to the Dark Ford. Alas for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gimli son of Gluin! â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Nay! â€™ said Fegolas. 'Alas for us all! And for all that walk the world<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in these after-days. For such is the way of it: to find and lose, as it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">seems to those whose boat is on the running stream. But I count you blessed,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gimli son of Gluin: for your loss you suffer of your own free will, and you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">might have chosen otherwise. But you have not forsaken your companions,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the least reward that you shall have is that the memory of Fothlurien shall<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">grow stale.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Maybe,' said Gimli; 'and I thank you for your words. True words<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">doubtless; yet all such comfort is cold. Memory is not what the heart<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">desires. That is only a mirror, be it clear as Kheled-zvram. Or so says the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">heart of Gimli the Dwarf. Elves may see things otherwise. Indeed I have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">heard that for them memory is more like to the waking world than to a dream.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Not so for Dwarves.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'But let us talk no more of it. Look to the boat! She is too low in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">water with all this baggage, and the Great River is swift. I do not wish to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">drown my grief in cold water.' He took up a paddle, and steered towards the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">western bank, following Aragorn's boat ahead, which had already moved out of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the middle stream.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">So the Company went on their long way, down the wide hurrying waters,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">borne ever southwards. Bare woods stalked along either bank, and they could<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">not see any glimpse of the lands behind. The breeze died away and the River<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">flowed without a sound. No voice of bird broke the silence. The sun grew<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">misty as the day grew old, until it gleamed in a pale sky like a high white<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">pearl. Then it faded into the West, and dusk came early, followed by a grey<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and starless night. Far into the dark quiet hours they floated on, guiding<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">their boats under the overhanging shadows of the western woods. Great trees<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">passed by like ghosts, thrusting their twisted thirsty roots through the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mist down into the water. It was dreary and cold. Frodo sat and listened to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the faint lap and gurgle of the River fretting among the tree-roots and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">driftwood near the shore, until his head nodded and he fell into an uneasy<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sleep.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo was roused by Sam. He found that he was lying, well wrapped,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">under tall grey -skinned trees in a quiet corner of the woodlands on the west<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">bank of the Great River, Anduin. He had slept the night away, and the grey<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of morning was dim among the bare branches. Gimli was busy with a small fire<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">near at hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They started again before the day was broad. Not that most of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Company were eager to hurry southwards: they were content that the decision,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">which they must make at latest when they came to Rauros and the Tindrock<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Isle, still lay some days ahead; and they let the River bear them on at its<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">own pace, having no desire to hasten towards the perils that lay beyond,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">whichever course they took in the end. Aragorn let them drift with the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stream as they wished, husbanding their strength against weariness to come.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But he insisted that at least they should start early each day and journey<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">on far into the evening; for he felt in his heart that time was pressing,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and he feared that the Dark Lord had not been idle while they lingered in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Lurien.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Nonetheless they saw no sign of an enemy that day, nor the next. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dull grey hours passed without event. As the third day of their voyage wore<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">on the lands changed slowly: the trees thinned and then failed altogether.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">On the eastern bank to their left they saw long formless slopes stretching<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">up and away toward the sky; brown and withered they looked, as if fire had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">passed over them, leaving no living blade of green: an unfriendly waste<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">without even a broken tree or a bold stone to relieve the emptiness. They<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">had come to the Brown Lands that lay, vast and desolate, between Southern<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mirkwood and the hills of the Emyn Muil. What pestilence or war or evil deed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of the Enemy had so blasted all that region even Aragorn could not tell.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Upon the west to their right the land was treeless also, but it was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">flat, and in many places green with wide plains of grass. On this side of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the River they passed forests of great reeds, so tall that they shut out all<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">view to the west, as the little boats went rustling by along their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fluttering borders. Their dark withered plumes bent and tossed in the light<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">cold airs, hissing softly and sadly. Here and there through openings Frodo<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">could catch sudden glimpses of rolling meads, and far beyond them hills in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the sunset, and away on the edge of sight a dark line, where marched the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">southernmost ranks of the Misty Mountains.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There was no sign of living moving things, save birds. Of these there<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were many: small fowl whistling and piping in the reeds, but they were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">seldom seen. Once or twice the travellers heard the rush and whine of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">swan-wings, and looking up they saw a great phalanx streaming along the sky.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Swans! ' said Sam. 'And mighty big ones too! â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Yes,' said Aragorn, â€™and they are black swans.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'How wide and empty and mournful all this country looks! â€™ said Frodo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I always imagined that as one journeyed south it got warmer and merrier,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">until winter was left behind for ever.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™But we have not journeyed far south yet,â€™ answered Aragorn. 'It is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Belfalas, to which Anduin runs, it is warm and merry, maybe, or would be but<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">for the Enemy. But here we are not above sixty leagues, I guess, south of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Southfarthing away in your Shire, hundreds of long miles yonder. You are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">looking now south-west across the north plains of the Riddermark, Rohan the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">land of the Horse-lords. Ere long we shall come to the mouth of the Limlight<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that runs down from Fangorn to join the Great River. That is the north<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">boundary of Rohan; and of old all that lay between Limlight and the White<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mountains belonged to the Rohirrim. It is a rich and pleasant land, and its<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">grass has no rival; but in these evil days folk do not dwell by the River or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ride often to its shores. Anduin is wide, yet the ores can shoot their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">arrows far across the stream; and of late, it is said, they have dared to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">cross the water and raid the herds and studs of Rohan.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sam looked from bank to bank uneasily. The trees had seemed hostile<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">before, as if they harboured secret eyes and lurking dangers; now he wished<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that the trees were still there. He felt that the Company was too naked,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">afloat in little open boats in the midst of shelterless lands, and on a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">river that was the frontier of war.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the next day or two, as they went on, borne steadily southwards,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">this feeling of insecurity grew on all the Company. For a whole day they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">took to their paddles and hastened forward. The banks slid by. Soon the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">River broadened and grew more shallow; long stony beaches lay upon the east,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and there were gravel-shoals in the water, so that careful steering was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">needed. The Brown Lands rose into bleak wolds, over which flowed a chill air<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">from the East. On the other side the meads had become rolling downs of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">withered grass amidst a land of fen and tussock. Frodo shivered, thinking of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the lawns and fountains, the clear sun and gentle rains of Lothlurien. There<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was little speech and no laughter in any of the boats. Each member of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Company was busy with his own thoughts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The heart of Legolas was running under the stars of a summer night in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">some northern glade amid the beech- woods; Gimli was fingering gold in his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mind, and wondering if it were fit to be wrought into the housing of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Lady's gift. Merry and Pippin in the middle boat were ill at ease, for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Boromir sat muttering to himself, sometimes biting his nails, as if some<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">restlessness or doubt consumed him, sometimes seizing a paddle and driving<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the boat close behind Aragorn's. Then Pippin, who sat in the bow looking<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">back, caught a queer gleam in his eye, as he peered forward gazing at Frodo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sam had long ago made up his mind that, though boats were maybe not as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dangerous as he had been brought up to believe, they were far more<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">uncomfortable than even he had imagined. Fie was cramped and miserable,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">having nothing to do but stare at the winter -lands crawling by and the grey<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">water on either side of him. Even when the paddles were in use they did not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">trust Sam with one.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As dusk drew down on the fourth day, he was looking back over the bowed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">heads of Frodo and Aragorn and the following boats; he was drowsy and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">longed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">for camp and the feel of earth under his toes. Suddenly something caught his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sight: at first he stared at it listlessly, then he sat up and rubbed his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">eyes; but when he looked again he could not see it any more.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">That night they camped on a small eyot close to the western bank. Sam<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">lay rolled in blankets beside Frodo. V I had a funny dream an hour or two<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">before we stopped, Mr. Frodo,' he said. 'Or maybe it wasn't a dream. Funny<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it was anyway.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well, what was it? ' said Frodo, knowing that Sam would not settle<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">down until he had told his tale, whatever it was. 'I haven't seen or thought<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of anything to make me smile since we left Lothlurien.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'It wasn't funny that way, Mr. Frodo. It was queer. All wrong, if it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wasn't a dream. And you had best hear it. It was like this: I saw a log with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">eyes! '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'The log's all right,' said Frodo. 'There are many in the River. But<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">leave out the eyes ! â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'That I won't,' said Sam. ' 'Twas the eyes as made me sit up, so to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">speak. I saw what I took to be a log floating along in the half-light behind<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gimli's boat; but I didn't give much heed to it. Then it seemed as if the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">log was slowly catching us up. And that was peculiar, as you might say,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">seeing as we were all floating on the stream together. Just then I saw the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">eyes: two pale sort of points, shiny -like, on a hump at the near end of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">log. What's more, it wasn't a log, for it had paddle-feet, like a swan's<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">almost, only they seemed bigger, and kept dipping in and out of the water.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'That's when I sat right up and rubbed my eyes, meaning to give a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shout, if it was still there when I had rubbed the drowse out of my head.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">For the whatever -it-was was coming along fast now and getting close behind<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gimli. But whether those two lamps spotted me moving and staring, or whether<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I came to my senses, I don't know. When I looked again, it wasn't there. Yet<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I think I caught a glimpse with the tail of-my eye, as the saying is, of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">something dark shooting under the shadow of the bank. I couldn't see no more<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">eyes though.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I said to myself: "dreaming again, Sam Gamgee," I said: and I said no<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">more just then. But I've been thinking since, and now I'm not so sure. What<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">do you make of it, Mr. Frodo? '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I should make nothing of it but a log and the dusk and sleep in your<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">eyes Sam, said Frodo, if this was the first time that those eyes had been<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">seen. But it isn't. I saw them away back north before we reached Lurien. And<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I saw a strange creature with eyes climbing to the flet that night. Haldir<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">saw it too. And do you remember the report of the Elves that went after the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ore-band? '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Ah,' said Sam. 'I do; and I remember more too. I don't like my<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">thoughts; but thinking of one thing and another, and Mr. Bilbo's stories and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">all, I fancy I could put a name on the creature, at a guess. A nasty name.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gollum, maybe? '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Yes, that is what I have feared for some time,' said Frodo. 'Ever<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">since the night on the flet. I suppose he was lurking in Moria, and picked<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">up our trail then; but I hoped that our stay in Lurien would throw him off<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the scent again. The miserable creature must have been hiding in the woods<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">by the Silverlode, watching us start off! â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'That's about it,' said Sam. 'And we'd better be a bit more watchful<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ourselves, or we'll feel some nasty fingers round our necks one of these<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">nights, if we ever wake up to feel anything. And that's what I was leading<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">up to. No need to trouble Strider or the others tonight. I'll keep watch. I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">can sleep tomorrow, being no more than luggage in a boat, as you might say.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">V I might,' said Frodo, 'and I might say "luggage with eyes". You shall<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">watch; but only if you promise to wake me halfway towards morning, if<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">nothing happens before then.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">In the dead hours Frodo came out of a deep dark sleep to find Sam<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shaking him. 'It's a shame to wake you,' whispered Sam, 'but that's what you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">said. There's nothing to tell, or not much. I thought I heard some soft<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">plashing and a sniffing noise, a while back; but you hear a lot of such<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">queer sounds by a river at night.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He lay down, and Frodo sat up, huddled in his blankets, and fought off<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his sleep. Minutes or hours passed slowly, and nothing happened. Frodo was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">just yielding to the temptation to lie down again when a dark shape, hardly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">visible, floated close to one of the moored boats. A long whitish hand could<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">be dimly seen as it shot out and grabbed the gunwale; two pale lamplike eyes<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shone coldly as they peered inside, and then they lifted and gazed up at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo on the eyot. They were not more than a yard or two away, and Frodo<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">heard the soft hiss of intaken breath. He stood up, drawing Sting from its<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sheath, and faced the eyes. Immediately their light was shut off. There was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">another hiss and a splash, and the dark log-shape shot away downstream into<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the night. Aragorn stirred in his sleep, turned over, and sat up'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'What is it? ' he whispered, springing up and coming to Frodo. 'I felt<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">something in my sleep. Why have you drawn your sword? '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Gollum,' answered Frodo. 'Or at least, so I guess.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Ah! ' said Aragorn. 'So you know about our little footpad, do you? He<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">padded after us all through Moria and right down to Nimrodel. Since we took<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to boats, he has been lying on a log and paddling with hands and feet. I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">have tried to catch him once or twice at night; but he is slier than a fox,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and as slippery as a fish. I hoped the river-voyage would beat him, but he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">is too clever a waterman.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'We shall have to try going faster tomorrow. You lie down now, and I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">will keep watch for what is left of the night. I wish I could lay my hands<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">on the wretch. We might make him useful. But if I cannot, we shall have to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">try and lose him. He is very dangerous. Quite apart from murder by night on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his own account, he may put any enemy that is about on our track.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The night passed without Gollum showing so much as a shadow again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After that the Company kept a sharp look-out, but they saw no more of Gollum<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">while the voyage lasted. If he was still following, he was very wary and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">cunning. At Aragornâ€™s bidding they paddled now for long spells, and the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">banks went swiftly by. But they saw little of the country, for they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">journeyed mostly by night and twilight, resting by day, and lying as hidden<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">as the land allowed. In this way the time passed without event until the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">seventh day.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The weather was still grey and overcast, with wind from the East, but<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">as evening drew into night the sky away westward cleared, and pools of faint<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">light, yellow and pale green, opened under the grey shores of cloud. There<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the white rind of the new Moon could be seen glimmering in the remote lakes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sam looked at it and puckered his brows.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The next day the country on either side began to change rapidly. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">banks began to rise and grow stony. Soon they were passing through a hilly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">rocky land, and on both shores there were steep slopes buried in deep brakes<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of thorn and sloe, tangled with brambles and creepers. Behind them stood low<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">crumbling cliffs, and chimneys of grey weathered stone dark with ivy; and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">beyond these again there rose high ridges crowned with wind-writhen firs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They were drawing near to the grey hill -country of the Emyn Muil, the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">southern march of Wilderland.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There were many birds about the cliffs and the rock-chimneys, and all<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">day high in the air flocks of birds had been circling, black against the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">pale sky. As they lay in their camp that day Aragorn watched the flights<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">doubtfully, wondering if Gollum had been doing some mischief and the news<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">their voyage was now moving in the wilderness. Later as the sun was setting,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and the Company was stirring and getting ready to start again, he descried a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dark spot against the fading light: a great bird high and far off, now<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wheeling, now flying on slowly southwards.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™What is that, Legolas? ' he asked, pointing to the northern sky. 'Is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it, as I think, an eagle? '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™Yes.' said Legolas. 'It is an eagle, a hunting eagle. I wonder what<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that forebodes. It is far from the mountains.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'We will not start until it is fully dark,' said Aragorn.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The eighth night of their journey came. It was silent and windless; the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">grey east wind had passed away. The thin crescent of the Moon had fallen<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">early into the pale sunset, but the sky was clear above, and though far away<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in the South there were great ranges of cloud that still shone faintly, in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the West stars glinted bright.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Come! ' said Aragorn. 'We will venture one more journey by night. We<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">are coming to reaches of the River that I do not know well: for I have never<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">journeyed by water in these parts before, not between here and the rapids of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sarn Gebir. But if I am right in my reckoning, those are still many miles<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ahead. Still there are dangerous places even before we come there: rocks and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stony eyots in the stream. We must keep a sharp watch and not try to paddle<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">swiftly.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">To Sam in the leading boat was given the task of watchman. He lay<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">forward peering into the gloom. The night grew dark, but the stars above<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were strangely bright, and there was a glimmer On the face of the River. It<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was close on midnight, and they had been drifting for some while, hardly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">using the paddles, when suddenly Sam cried out. Only a few yards ahead dark<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shapes loomed up in the stream and he heard the swirl of racing water. There<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was a swift current which swung left, towards the eastern shore where the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">channel was clear. As they were swept aside the travellers could see, now<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">very close, the pale foam of the River lashing against sharp rocks that were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">thrust out far into the stream like a ridge of teeth. The boats were all<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">huddled together.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Hoy there, Aragorn! â€™ shouted Boromir, as his boat bumped into the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">leader. 'This is madness! We cannot dare the Rapids by night! But no boat<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">can live in Sarn Gebir, be it night or day.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Back, back! â€™ cried Aragorn. Turn! Turn if you can! â€™ He drove his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">paddle into the water, trying to hold the boat and bring it round.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™I am out of my reckoning,â€™ he said to Frodo. â€™I did not know that we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">had come so far: Anduin flows faster than I thought. Sarn Gebir must be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">close at hand already.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">With great efforts they checked the boats and slowly brought them<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">about; but at first they could make only small headway against the current,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and all the time they were carried nearer and nearer to the eastern bank.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Now dark and ominous it loomed up in the night.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™All together, paddle! â€™ shouted Boromir. â€™Paddle! Or we shall be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">driven on the shoals.â€™ Even as he spoke Frodo felt the keel beneath him<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">grate upon stone.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At that moment there was a twang of bowstrings: several arrows whistled<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">over them, and some fell among them. One smote Frodo between the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shoulders<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and he lurched forward with a cry, letting go his paddle: but the arrow fell<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">back, foiled by his hidden coat of mail. Another passed through Aragorn's<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hood; and a third stood fast in the gunwale of the second boat, close by<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Merry's hand. Sam thought he could glimpse black figures running to and fro<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">upon the long shingle -banks that lay under the eastern shore. They seemed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">very near.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">' Yrch !' said Legolas, falling into his own tongue.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Ores! ' cried Gimli.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Gollum's doing, I'll be bound.' said Sam to Frodo. 'And a nice place<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to choose, too. The River seems set on taking us right into their arms! '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They all leaned forward straining at the paddles: even Sam took a hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Every moment they expected to feel the bite of black -feathered arrows. Many<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">whined overhead or struck the water nearby; but there were no more hits. It<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was dark, but not too dark for the night-eyes of Ores, and in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">star-glimmer they must have offered their cunning foes some mark, unless it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was that the grey cloaks Of Lurien and the grey timber of the elf- wrought<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">boats defeated the malice of the archers of Mordor.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Stroke by stroke they laboured on. In the darkness it was hard to be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sure that they were indeed moving at all; but slowly the swirl of the water<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">grew less, and the shadow of the eastern bank faded back into the night. At<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">last, as far as they could judge, they had reached the middle of the stream<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">again and had driven their boats back some distance above the jutting rocks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Then half turning they thrust them with all their strength towards the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">western shore. Under the shadow Of bushes leaning out over the water they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">halted and drew breath.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Legolas laid down his paddle and took up the bow that he had brought<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">from Lurien. Then he sprang ashore and climbed a few paces up the bank.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Stringing the bow and fitting an arrow he turned, peering back over the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">River into the darkness. Across the water there were shrill cries, but<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">nothing could be seen.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo looked up at the Elf standing tall above him, as he gazed into<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the night, seeking a mark to shoot at. His head was dark, crowned with sharp<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">white stars that glittered in the black pools of the sky behind. But now<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">rising and sailing up from the South the great clouds advanced, sending out<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dark outriders into the starry fields. A sudden dread fell on the Company.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">' Elbereth Gilthoniel!' sighed Legolas as he looked up. Even as he did<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">so, a dark shape, like a cloud and yet not a cloud, for it moved far more<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">swiftly, came out of the blackness in the South, and sped towards the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Company, blotting out all light as it approached. Soon it appeared as a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">great winged creature, blacker than the pits in the night. Fierce voices<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">rose up to greet it from across the water. Frodo felt a sudden chill running<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">through him and clutching at his heart; there was a deadly cold, like the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">memory of an old wound, in his shoulder. He crouched down, as if to hide.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Suddenly the great bow of Lurien sang. Shrill went the arrow from the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">elven-string. Frodo looked up. Almost above him the winged shape swerved.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There was a harsh croaking scream, as it fell out of the air, vanishing down<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">into the gloom of the eastern shore. The sky was clean again. There was a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">tumult of many voices far away, cursing and wailing in the darkness, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">then silence. Neither shaft nor cry came again from the east that night.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">After a while Aragorn led the boats back upstream. They felt their way<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">along the waterâ€™s edge for some distance, until they found a small shallow<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">bay. A few low trees grew there close to the water, and behind them rose a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">steep rocky bank. Here the Company decided to stay and await the dawn: it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was useless to attempt to move further by night. They made no camp and lit<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">no fire, but lay huddled in the boats, moored close together.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™Praised be the bow of Galadriel, and the hand and eye of Legolas ! â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">said Gimli, as he munched a wafer of lembas. 'That was a mighty shot in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dark, my friend!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'But who can say what it hit?' said Legolas.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I cannot,' said Gimli. 'But I am glad that the shadow came no nearer.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I liked it not at all. Too much it reminded me of the shadow in Moria â€” the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shadow of the Balrog,' he ended in a whisper.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'It was not a Balrog,' said Frodo, still shivering with the chill that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">had come upon him. 'It was something colder. I think it was â€” ' Then he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">paused and fell silent.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'What do you think? ' asked Boromir eagerly, leaning from his boat, as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">if he was trying to catch a glimpse of Frodo's face.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I think â€” No, I will not say,' answered Frodo. 'Whatever it was, its<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fall has dismayed our enemies.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'So it seems,' said Aragorn. 'Yet where they are, and how many, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">what they will do next, we do not know. This night we must all be sleepless!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Dark hides us now. But what the day will show who can tell? Have your<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">weapons close to hand! '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sam sat tapping the hilt of his sword as if he were counting on his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fingers, and looking up at the sky. "It's very strange,' he murmured. 'The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Moon's the same in the Shire and in Wilderland, or it ought to be. But<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">either it's out of its running, or I'm all wrong in my reckoning. You'll<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">remember, Mr. Frodo, the Moon was waning as we lay on the flet up in that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">tree: a week from the full, I reckon. And we'd been a week on the way last<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">night, when up pops a New Moon as thin as a nail-paring, as if we had never<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stayed no time in the Elvish country.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well, I can remember three nights there for certain, and I seem to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">remember several more, but I would take my oath it was never a whole month.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Anyone would think that time did not count in there! â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'And perhaps that was the way of it,â€™ said Frodo. 'In that land, maybe,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">we were in a time that has elsewhere long gone by. It was not, I think,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">until Silverlode bore us back to Anduin that we returned to the time that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">flows through mortal lands to the Great Sea. And I don't remember any moon,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">either new or old, in Caras Galadhon: only stars by night and sun by day.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Legolas stirred in his boat. 'Nay, time does not tarry ever,' he said;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'but change and growth is not in all things and places alike. For the Elves<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the world moves, and it moves both very swift and very slow. Swift, because<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they themselves change little, and all else fleets by: it is a grief to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">them. Slow, because they do not count the running years, not for themselves.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The passing seasons are but ripples ever repeated in the long long stream.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Yet beneath the Sun all things must wear to an end at last.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'But the wearing is slow in Lurien,' said Frodo. 'The power of the Lady<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">is on it. Rich are the hours, though short they seem, in Caras Galadhon,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">where Galadriel wields the Elven-ring.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'That should not have been said outside Lurien, not even to me,' said<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Aragorn. 'Speak no more of it! But so it is, Sam: in that land you lost your<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">count. There time flowed swiftly by us, as for the Elves. The old moon<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">passed, and a new moon waxed and waned in the world outside, while we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">tarried there. And yestereve a new moon came again. Winter is nearly gone.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Time flows on to a spring of little hope.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The night passed silently. No voice or call was heard again across the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">water. The travellers huddled in their boats felt the changing of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">weather. The air grew warm and very still under the great moist clouds that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">had floated up from the South and the distant seas. The rushing of the River<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">over the rocks of the rapids seemed to grow louder and closer. The twigs of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the trees above them began to drip.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">When the day came the mood of the world about them had become soft and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sad. Slowly the dawn grew to a pale light, diffused and shadowless. There<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was mist on the River, and white fog swathed the shore; the far bank could<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">not be seen.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I can't abide fog,' said Sam; 'but this seems to be a lucky one. Now<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">perhaps we can get away without those cursed goblins seeing us.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Perhaps so,' said Aragorn. 'But it will be hard to find the path<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">unless the fog lifts a little later on. And we must find the path, if we are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to pass Sarn Gebir and come to the Emyn Muil.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I do not see why we should pass the Rapids or follow the River any<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">further,' said Boromir. 'If the Emyn Muil lie before us, then we can abandon<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">these cockle-boats, and strike westward and southward, until we come to the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Entwash and cross into my own land.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'We can, if we are making for Minas Tirith,â€™ said Aragorn, 'but that is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">not yet agreed. And such a course may be more perilous than it sounds. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">vale of Entwash is flat and fenny, and fog is a deadly peril there for those<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">on foot and laden. I would not abandon our boats until we must. The River is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">at least a path that cannot be missed.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'But the Enemy holds the eastern bank,' objected Boromir. 'And even if<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you pass the Gates of Argonath and come unmolested to the Tindrock, what<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">will you do then? Leap down the Falls and land in the marshes? â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'No! ' answered Aragorn. 'Say rather that we will bear our boats by the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ancient way to Rauros-foot, and there take to the water again. Do you not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">know, Boromir, or do you choose to forget the North Stair, and the high seat<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">upon Amon Hen, that were made in the days of the great kings? I at least<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">have a mind to stand in that high place again, before I decide my further<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">course. There, maybe, we shall see some sign that will guide us.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Boromir held out long against this choice; but when it became plain<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that Frodo would follow Aragorn, wherever he went, he gave in. 'It is not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the way of the Men of Minas Tirith to desert their friends at need,' he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">said, 'and you will need my strength, if ever you are to reach the Tindrock.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">To the tall isle I will go, but no further. There I shall turn to my home,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">alone if my help has not earned the reward of any companionship.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The day was now growing, and the fog had lifted a little. It was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">decided that Aragorn and Legolas should at once go forward along the shore,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">while the others remained by the boats. Aragorn hoped to find some way by<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">which they could carry both their boats and their baggage to the smoother<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">water beyond the Rapids.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Boats of the Elves would not sink, maybe,â€™ he said, 'but that does not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">say that we should come through Sarn Gebir alive. None have ever done so<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">yet. No road was made by the Men of Gondor in this region, for even in their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">great days their realm did not reach up Anduin beyond the Emyn Muil; but<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">there is a portage-way somewhere on the western shore, if I can find it. It<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">cannot yet have perished; for light boats used to journey out of Wilderland<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">down to Osgiliath, and still did so until a few years ago, when the Ores of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mordor began to multiply.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™Seldom in my life has any boat come out of the North, and the Ores<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">prowl on the east-shore,â€™ said Boromir. 'If you go forward, peril will grow<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with every mile, even if you find a path.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Peril lies ahead on every southward road,â€™ answered Aragorn. 'Wait for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">us one day. If we do not return in that time, you will know that evil has<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">indeed befallen us. Then you must take a new leader and follow him as best<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you can.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It was with a heavy heart that Frodo saw Aragorn and Legolas climb the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">steep bank and vanish into the mists; but his fears proved groundless. Only<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">two or three hours had passed, and it was barely mid-day, when the shadowy<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shapes of the explorers appeared again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'All is well,â€™ said Aragorn, as he clambered down the bank. â€™There is a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">track, and it leads to a good landing that is still serviceable. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">distance is not great: the head of the Rapids is but half a mile below us,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and they are little more than a mile long. Not far beyond them the stream<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">becomes clear and smooth again, though it runs swiftly. Our hardest task<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">will be to get our boats and baggage to the old portage- way. We have found<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it, but it lies well back from the water-side here, and runs under the lee<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of a rock-wall, a furlong or more from the shore. We did not find where the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">northward landing lies. If it still remains, we must have passed it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">yesterday night. We might labour far upstream and yet miss it in the fog. I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fear we must leave the River now, and make for the portage-way as best we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">can from here.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'That would not be easy, even if we were all Men,â€™ said Boromir.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Yet such as we are we will try it,â€™ said Aragorn.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™Aye, we will,â€™ said Gimli. 'The legs of Men will lag on a rough road,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">while a Dwarf goes on, be the burden twice his own weight, Master Boromir! â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The task proved hard indeed, yet in the end it was done. The goods were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">taken out of the boats and brought to the top of the bank, where there was a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">level space. Then the boats were drawn out of the water and carried up. They<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were far less heavy than any had expected. Of what tree growing in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">elvish country they were made not even Legolas knew; but the wood was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">tough<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and yet strangely light. Merry and Pippin alone could carry their boat with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ease along the flat. Nonetheless it needed the strength of the two Men to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">lift and haul them over the ground that the Company now had to cross. It<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sloped up away from the River, a tumbled waste of grey limestone-boulders,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with many hidden holes shrouded with weeds and bushes; there were thickets<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of brambles, and sheer dells; and here and there boggy pools fed by waters<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">trickling from the terraces further inland.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">One by one Boromir and Aragorn carried the boats, while the others<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">toiled and scrambled after them with the baggage. At last all was removed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and laid on the portage-way. Then with little further hindrance, save from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sprawling briars and many fallen stones, they moved forward all together.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Fog still hung in veils upon the crumbling rock-wall, and to their left mist<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shrouded the River: they could hear it rushing and foaming over the sharp<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shelves and stony teeth of Sarn Gebir, but they could not see it. Twice they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">made the journey, before all was brought safe to the southern landing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There the portage-way, turning back to the water-side, ran gently down<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to the shallow edge of a little pool. It seemed to have been scooped in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">river-side, not by hand, but by the water swirling down from Sarn Gebir<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">against a low pier of rock that jutted out some way into the stream. Beyond<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it the shore rose sheer into a grey cliff, and there was no further passage<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">for those on foot.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Already the short afternoon was past, and a dim cloudy dusk was closing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in. They sat beside the water listening to the confused rush and roar of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Rapids hidden in the mist; they were tired and sleepy, and their hearts were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">as gloomy as the dying day.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well, here we are, and here we must pass another night,' said Boromir.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'We need sleep, and even if Aragorn had a mind to pass the Gates of Argonath<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">by night, we are all too tired-except, no doubt, our sturdy dwarf.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gimli made no reply: he was nodding as he sat.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Let us rest as much as we can now,' said Aragorn. 'Tomorrow we must<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">journey by day again. Unless the weather changes once more and cheats us, we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shall have a good chance of slipping through, unseen by any eyes on the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">eastern shore. But tonight two must watch together in turns: three hours off<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and one on guard.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Nothing happened that night worse than a brief drizzle of rain an hour<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">before dawn. As soon as it was fully light they started. Already the fog was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">thinning. They kept as close as they could to the western side, and they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">could see the dim shapes of the low cliffs rising ever higher, shadowy walls<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with their feet in the hurrying river. In the mid-morning the clouds drew<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">down lower, and it began to rain heavily. They drew the skin -covers over<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">their boats to prevent them from being flooded, and drifted on: little could<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">be seen before them or about them through the grey falling curtains.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The rain, however, did not last long. Slowly the sky above grew<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">lighter, and then suddenly the clouds broke, and their draggled fringes<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">trailed away northward up the River. The fogs and mists were gone. Before<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the travellers lay a wide ravine, with great rocky sides to which clung,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">upon shelves and in narrow crevices, a few thrawn trees. The channel grew<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">narrower and the River swifter. Now they were speeding along with little<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hope of stopping or turning, whatever they might meet ahead. Over them was a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">lane of pale-blue sky, around them the dark overshadowed River, and before<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">them black, shutting out the sun, the hills of Emyn Muil, in which no<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">opening could be seen.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo peering forward saw in the distance two great rocks approaching:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">like great pinnacles or pillars of stone they seemed. Tall and sheer and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ominous they stood upon either side of the stream. A narrow gap appeared<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">between them, and the River swept the boats towards it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Behold the Argonath, the Pillars of the Kings! ' cried Aragorn. 'We<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shall pass them soon. Keep the boats in line, and as far apart as you can!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Hold the middle of the stream! â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">As Frodo was borne towards them the great pillars rose like towers to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">meet him. Giants they seemed to him, vast grey figures silent but<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">threatening. Then he saw that they were indeed shaped and fashioned: the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">craft and power of old had wrought upon them, and still they preserved<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">through the suns and rains of forgotten years the mighty likenesses in which<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they had been hewn. Upon great pedestals founded in the deep waters stood<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">two great kings of stone: still with blurred eyes and crannied brows they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">frowned upon the North. The left hand of each was raised palm outwards in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">gesture of warning; in each right hand there was an axe; upon each head<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">there was a crumbling helm and crown. Great power and majesty they still<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wore, the silent wardens of a long -vanished kingdom. Awe and fear fell upon<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo, and he cowered down, shutting his eyes and not daring to look up as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the boat drew near. Even Boromir bowed his head as the boats whirled by.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">frail and fleeting as little leaves, under the enduring shadow of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sentinels of NÂ®menor. So they passed into the dark chasm of the Gates.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sheer rose the dreadful cliffs to unguessed heights on either side. Far<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">off was the dim sky. The black waters roared and echoed, and a wind screamed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">over them. Frodo crouching over his knees heard Sam in front muttering and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">groaning: 'What a place! What a horrible place! Just let me get out of this<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">boat, and I'll never wet my toes in a puddle again, let alone a river! '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Fear not!' said a strange voice behind him. Frodo turned and saw<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Strider, and yet not Strider; for the weatherworn Ranger was no longer<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">there. In the stern sat Aragorn son of Arathorn, proud and erect, guiding<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the boat with skilful strokes; his hood was cast back, and his dark hair was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">blowing in the wind, a light was in his eyes: a king returning from exile to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his own land.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™Fear not! ' he said. 'Long have I desired to look upon the likenesses<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of Isildur and Anbrion, my sires of old. Under their shadow Elessar, the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Elfstone son of Arathorn of the House of Valandil Isildurâ€™s son heir of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Elendil, has nought to dread! â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Then the light of his eyes faded, and he spoke to himself: 'Would that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gandalf were here! How my heart yearns for Minas Anor and the walls of my<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">own city! But whither now shall I go? â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The chasm was long and dark, and filled with the noise of wind and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">rushing water and echoing stone. It bent somewhat towards the west so that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">at first all was dark ahead; but soon Frodo saw a tall gap of light before<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">him, ever growing. Swiftly it drew near, and suddenly the boats shot<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">through, out into a wide clear light.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The sun, already long fallen from the noon, was shining in a windy sky.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The pent waters spread out into a long oval lake, pale Nen Hithoel, fenced<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">by steep grey hills whose sides were clad with trees, but their heads were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">bare, cold-gleaming in the sunlight. At the far southern end rose three<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">peaks. The midmost stood somewhat forward from the others and sundered<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">them, an island in the waters, about which the flowing River flung pale<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shimmering arms. Distant but deep there came up on the wind a roaring sound<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">like the roll of thunder heard far away.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Behold Tol Brandir! ' said Aragorn, pointing south to the tall peak.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Upon the left stands Amon Lhaw, and upon the right is Amon Hen the Hills of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Hearing and of Sight. In the days of the great kings there were high seats<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">upon them, and watch was kept there. But it is said that no foot of man or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">beast has ever been set upon Tol Brandir. Ere the shade of night falls we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shall come to them. I hear the endless voice of Rauros calling.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The Company rested now for a while, drifting south on the current that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">flowed through the middle of the lake. They ate some food, and then they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">took to their paddles and hastened on their way. The sides of the westward<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hills fell into shadow, and the Sun grew round and red. Here and there a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">misty star peered out. The three peaks loomed before them, darkling in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">twilight. Rauros was roaring with a great voice. Already night was laid on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the flowing waters when the travellers came at last under the shadow of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hills.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The tenth day of their journey was over. Wilderland was behind them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They could go no further without choice between the east-way and the west.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The last stage of the Quest was before them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>

<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Chapter 10. The Breaking of the Fellowship<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Aragorn led them to the right arm of the River. Here upon its western<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">side under the shadow of Tol Brandir a green lawn ran down to the water from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the feet of Amon Hen. Behind it rose the first gentle slopes of the hill<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">clad with trees, and trees marched away westward along the curving shores of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the lake. A little spring fell tumbling down and fed the grass.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Here we will rest tonight,' said Aragorn. 'This is the lawn of Parth<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Galen: a fair place in the summer days of old. Let us hope that no evil has<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">yet come here.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">They drew up their boats on the green banks, and beside them they made<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">their camp. They set a watch, but had no sight nor sound of their enemies.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">If Gollum had contrived to follow them, he remained unseen and unheard.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Nonetheless as the night wore on Aragorn grew uneasy, tossing often in his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sleep and waking. In the small hours he got up and came to Frodo, whose turn<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it was to watch.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Why are you waking? ' asked Frodo. 'It is not your watch.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I do not know,â€™ answered Aragorn; 'but a shadow and a threat has been<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">growing in my sleep. It would be well to draw your sword.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Why? â€™ said Frodo. 'Are enemies at hand? â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Let us see what Sting may show,' answered Aragorn.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo then drew the elf-blade from its sheath. To his dismay the edges<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">gleamed dimly in the night. 'Ores! â€™ he said. 'Not very near, and yet too<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">near, it seems.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I feared as much,' said Aragorn. 'But maybe they are not on this side<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of the River. The light of Sting is faint, and it may point to no more than<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">spies of Mordor roaming on the slopes of Amon Lhaw. I have never heard<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">before of Ores upon Amon Hen. Yet who knows what may happen in these<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">evil<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">days, now that Minas Tirith no longer holds secure the passages of Anduin.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">We must go warily tomorrow.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The day came like fire and smoke. Low in the East there were black bars<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of cloud like the fumes of a great burning. The rising sun lit them from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">beneath with flames of murky red; but soon it climbed above them into a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">clear sky. The summit of Tol Brandir was tipped with gold. Frodo looked out<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">eastward and gazed at the tall island. Its sides sprang sheer out of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">running water. High up above the tall cliffs were steep slopes upon which<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">trees climbed, mounting one head above another; and above them again were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">grey faces of inaccessible rock, crowned by a great spire of stone. Many<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">birds were circling about it, but no sign of other living things could be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">seen.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">When they had eaten, Aragorn called the Company together. 'The day has<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">come at last,' he said: 'the day of choice which we have long delayed. What<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shall now become of our Company that has travelled so far in fellowship?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Shall we turn west with Boromir and go to the wars of Gondor; or turn east<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to the Fear and Shadow; or shall we break our fellowship and go this way and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">that as each may choose? Whatever we do must be done soon. We cannot<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">long<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">halt here. The enemy is on the eastern shore, we know; but I fear that the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Ores may already be on this side of the water.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There was a long silence in which no one spoke or moved.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well, Frodo,' said Aragorn at last. 'I fear that the burden is laid<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">upon you. You are the Bearer appointed by the Council. Your own way you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">alone can choose. In this matter I cannot advise you. I am not Gandalf, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">though I have tried to bear his part, I do not know what design or hope he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">had for this hour, if indeed he had any. Most likely it seems that if he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were here now the choice would still wait on you. Such is your fate.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo did not answer at once. Then he spoke slowly. 'I know that haste<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">is needed, yet I cannot choose. The burden is heavy. Give me an hour longer,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and I will speak. Let me be alone! â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Aragorn looked at him with kindly pity. 'Very well, Frodo son of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Drogo,' he said. 'You shall have an hour, and you shall be alone. We will<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stay here for a while. But do not stray far or out of call.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo sat for a moment with his head bowed. Sam, who had been watching<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his master with great concern, shook his head and muttered: 'Plain as a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">pikestaff it is, but it's no good Sam Gamgee putting in his spoke just now.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Presently Frodo got up and walked away; and Sam saw that while the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">others restrained themselves and did not stare at him, the eyes of Boromir<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">followed Frodo intently, until he passed out of sight in the trees at the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">foot of Amon Hen.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Wandering aimlessly at first in the wood, Frodo found that his feet<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were leading him up towards the slopes of the hill. He came to a path, the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dwindling ruins of a road of long ago. In steep places stairs of stone had<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">been hewn, but now they were cracked and worn, and split by the roots of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">trees. For some while he climbed, not caring which way he went, until he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">came to a grassy place. Rowan-trees grew about it, and in the midst was a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wide flat stone. The little upland lawn was open upon the East and was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">filled now with the early sunlight. Frodo halted and looked out over the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">River, far below him, to Tol Brandir and the birds wheeling in the great<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">gulf of air between him and the untrodden isle. The voice of Rauros was a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mighty roaring mingled with a deep throbbing boom.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He sat down upon the stone and cupped his chin in his hands, staring<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">eastwards but seeing little with his eyes. All that had happened since Bilbo<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">left the Shire was passing through his mind, and he recalled and pondered<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">everything that he could remember of Gandalf s words. Time went on, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">still he was no nearer to a choice.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Suddenly he awoke from his thoughts: a strange feeling came to him that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">something was behind him, that unfriendly eyes were upon him. He sprang up<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and turned; but all that he saw to his surprise was Boromir, and his face<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was smiling and kind.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I was afraid for you, Frodo,' he said, coming forward. 'If Aragorn is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">right and Ores are near, then none of us should wander alone, and you least<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of all: so much depends on you. And my heart too is heavy. May I stay now<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and talk for a while, since I have found you? It would comfort me. Where<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">there are so many, all speech becomes a debate without end. But two together<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">may perhaps find wisdom.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You are kind,' answered Frodo. 'But I do not think that any speech<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">will help me. For I know what I should do, but I am afraid of doing it,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Boromir: afraid.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Boromir stood silent. Rauros roared endlessly on. The wind murmured in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the branches of the trees. Frodo shivered.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Suddenly Boromir came and sat beside him. 'Are you sure that you do not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">suffer needlessly? â€™ he said. 'I wish to help you. You need counsel in your<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hard choice. Will you not take mine? â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™I think I know already what counsel you would give, Boromir,' said<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo. 'And it would seem like wisdom but for the warning of my heart.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Warning? Warning against what? ' said Boromir sharply.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Against delay. Against the way that seems easier. Against refusal of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the burden that is laid on me. Against -well, if it must be said, against<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">trust in the strength and truth of Men.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Yet that strength has long protected you far away in your little<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">country, though you knew it not.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I do not doubt the valour of your people. But the world is changing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The walls of Minas Tirith may be strong, but they are not strong enough. If<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they fail, what then? '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'We shall fall in battle valiantly. Yet there is still hope that they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">will not fail.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'No hope while the Ring lasts,' said Frodo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Ah! The Ring! ' said Boromir, his eyes lighting. 'The Ring! Is it not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a strange fate that we should suffer so much fear and doubt for so small a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">thing? So small a thing! And I have seen it only for an instant in the House<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of Elrond. Could I not have a sight of it again? '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo looked up. His heart went suddenly cold. He caught the strange<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">gleam in Boromir's eyes, yet his face was still kind and friendly. 'It is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">best that it should lie hidden,' he answered.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'As you wish. I care not,' said Boromir. 'Yet may I not even speak of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it? For you seem ever to think only of its power in the hands of the Enemy:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of its evil uses not of its good. The world is changing, you say. Minas<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Tirith will fall, if the Ring lasts. But why? Certainly, if the Ring were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with the Enemy. But why, if it were with us? '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Were you not at the Council? ' answered Frodo. 'Because we cannot use<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it, and what is done with it turns to evil.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Boromir got up and walked about impatiently. 'So you go on,' he cried.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Gandalf, Elrond â€” all these folk have taught you to say so. For themselves<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they may be right. These elves and half-elves and wizards, they would come<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to grief perhaps. Yet often I doubt if they are wise and not merely timid.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But each to his own kind. True-hearted Men, they will not be corrupted. We<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of Minas Tirith have been staunch through long years of trial. We do not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">desire the power of wizard-lords, only strength to defend ourselves,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">strength in a just cause. And behold! in our need chance brings to light the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">-Ring of Power. It is a gift, I say; a gift to the foes of Mordor. It is mad<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">not to use it, to use the power of the Enemy against him. The fearless, the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ruthless, these alone will achieve victory. What could not a warrior do in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">this hour, a great leader? What could not Aragorn do? Or if he refuses, why<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">not Boromir? The Ring would give me power of Command. How I would<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">drive the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hosts of Mordor, and all men would flock to my banner!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Boromir strode up and down, speaking ever more loudly: Almost he seemed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to have forgotten Frodo, while his talk dwelt on walls and weapons, and the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mustering of men; and he drew plans for great alliances and glorious<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">victories to be; and he cast down Mordor, and became himself a mighty king,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">benevolent and wise. Suddenly he stopped and waved his arms.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'And they tell us to throw it away!' he cried. 'I do not say destroy<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">it. That might be well, if reason could show any hope of doing so. It does<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">not. The only plan that is proposed to us is that a halfling should walk<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">blindly into Mordor and offer the Enemy every chance of recapturing it for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">himself. Folly!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Surely you see it, my friend?' he said, turning now suddenly to Frodo<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">again. 'You say that you are afraid. If it is so, the boldest should pardon<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">you. But is it not really your good sense that revolts?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'No, I am afraid,' said Frodo. 'Simply afraid. But I am glad to have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">heard you speak so fully. My mind is clearer now.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Then you will come to Minas Tirith? ' cried Boromir. His eyes were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shining and his face eager.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You misunderstand me,â€™ said Frodo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'But you will come, at least for a while? ' Boromir persisted. 'My city<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">is not far now; and it is little further from there to Mordor than from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">here. We have been long in the wilderness, and you need news of what the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Enemy is doing before you make a move. Come with me, Frodo,' he said.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'You<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">need rest before your venture, if go you must.â€™ He laid his hand on the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hobbit's shoulder in friendly fashion; but Frodo felt the hand trembling<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with suppressed excitement. He stepped quickly away, and eyed with alarm the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">tall Man, nearly twice his height and many times his match in strength.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Why are you so unfriendly? â€™ said Boromir. 'I am a true man, neither<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">thief nor tracker. I need your Ring: that you know now; but I give you my<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">word that I do not desire to keep it. Will you not at least let me make<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">trial of my plan? Lend me the Ring! â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'No! no! ' cried Frodo. 'The Council laid it upon me to bear it.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'It is by our own folly that the Enemy will defeat us,â€™ cried Boromir.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'How it angers me! Fool! Obstinate fool! Running wilfully to death and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mining our cause. If any mortals have claim to the Ring, it is the men of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">NÂ®menor, and not Halflings. It is not yours save by unhappy chance. It might<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">have been mine. It should be mine. Give it to me ! '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo did not answer, but moved away till the great flat stone stood<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">between them. 'Come, come, my friend! ' said Boromir in a softer voice. 'Why<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">not get rid of it? Why not be free of your doubt and fear? You can lay the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">blame on me, if you will. You can say that I was too strong and took it by<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">force. For I am too strong for you, halfling,' he cried; and suddenly he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sprang over the stone and leaped at Frodo. His fair and pleasant face was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hideously changed; a raging fire was in his eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo dodged aside and again put the stone between them. There was only<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">one thing he could do: trembling he pulled out the Ring upon its chain and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">quickly slipped it on his finger, even as Boromir sprang at him again. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Man gasped, stared for a moment amazed, and then ran wildly about, seeking<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">here and there among the rocks and trees.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Miserable trickster!' he shouted. 'Let me get my hands on you! Now I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">see your mind. You will take the Ring to Sauron and sell us all. You have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">only waited your chance to leave us in the lurch. Curse you and all<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">halflings to death and darkness ! ' Then, catching his foot on a stone, he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fell sprawling and lay upon his face. For a while he was as still as if his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">own curse had struck him down; then suddenly he wept.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He rose and passed his hand over his eyes, dashing away the tears.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'What have I said? ' he cried. 'What have I done? Frodo, Frodo! ' he called.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Come back! A madness took me, but it has passed. Come back! '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There was no answer. Frodo did not even hear his cries. He was already<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">far away, leaping blindly up the path to the hill-top. Terror and grief<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shook him, seeing in his thought the mad fierce face of Boromir, and his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">burning eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Soon he came out alone on the summit of Amon Hen, and halted, gasping<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">for breath. He saw as through a mist a wide flat circle, paved with mighty<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">flags, and surrounded with a crumbling battlement; and in the middle, set<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">upon four carven pillars, was a high seat, reached by a stair of many steps.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Up he went and sat upon the ancient chair, feeling like a lost child that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">had clambered upon the throne of mountain -kings.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At first he could see little. He seemed to be in a world of mist in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">which there were only shadows: the Ring was upon him. Then here and there<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the mist gave way and he saw many visions: small and clear as if they were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">under his eyes upon a table, and yet remote. There was no sound, only bright<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">living images. The world seemed to have shrunk and fallen silent. He was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sitting upon the Seat of Seeing, on Amon Hen, the Hill of the Eye of the Men<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of NÂ®menor. Eastward he looked into wide uncharted lands, nameless plains,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and forests unexplored. Northward he looked, and the Great River lay like a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">ribbon beneath him, and the Misty Mountains stood small and hard as broken<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">teeth. Westward he looked and saw the broad pastures of Rohan; and Orthanc,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the pinnacle of Isengard, like a black spike. Southward he looked, and below<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his very feet the Great River curled like a toppling wave and plunged over<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the falls of Rauros into a foaming pit; a glimmering rainbow played upon the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fume. And Ethir Anduin he saw, the mighty delta of the River, and myriads of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">sea-birds whirling like a white dust in the sun, and beneath them a green<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and silver sea, rippling in endless lines.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">But everywhere he looked he saw the signs of war. The Misty Mountains<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">were crawling like anthills: ores were issuing out of a thousand holes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Under the boughs of Mirkwood there was deadly strife of Elves and Men and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">fell beasts. The land of the Beornings was aflame; a cloud was over Moria;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">smoke rose on the borders of Lurien.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Horsemen were galloping on the grass of Rohan; wolves poured from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Isengard. From the havens of Harad ships of war put out to sea; and out of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the East Men were moving endlessly: swordsmen, spearmen, bowmen upon<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">horses,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">chariots of chieftains and laden wains. All the power of the Dark Lord was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">in motion. Then turning south again he beheld Minas Tirith. Far away it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">seemed, and beautiful: white-walled, many -towered, proud and fair upon its<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mountain- seat; its battlements glittered with steel, and its turrets were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">bright with many banners. Hope leaped in his heart. But against Minas Tirith<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was set another fortress, greater and more strong. Thither, eastward,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">unwilling his eye was drawn. It passed the ruined bridges of Osgiliath, the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">grinning gates of Minas Morgul. and the haunted Mountains, and it looked<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">upon Gorgoroth, the valley of terror in the Land of Mordor. Darkness lay<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">there under the Sun. Fire glowed amid the smoke. Mount Doom was burning,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a great reek rising. Then at last his gaze was held: wall upon wall,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">battlement upon battlement, black, immeasurably strong, mountain of iron,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">gate of steel, tower of adamant, he saw it: Barad-dyr, Fortress of Sauron.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">All hope left him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">And suddenly he felt the Eye. There was an eye in the Dark Tower that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">did not sleep. He knew that it had become aware of his gaze. A fierce eager<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">will was there. It leaped towards him; almost like a finger he felt it,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">searching for him. Very soon it would nail him down, know just exactly where<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he was. Amon Lhaw it touched. It glanced upon Tol Brandir he threw himself<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">from the seat, crouching, covering his head with his grey hood.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He heard himself crying out: Never, never! Or was it: Verily I come, I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">come to you ? He could not tell. Then as a flash from some other point of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">power there came to his mind another thought: Take it off! Take it off!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Fool, take it off! Take off the Ring!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The two powers strove in him. For a moment, perfectly balanced between<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">their piercing points, he writhed, tormented. Suddenly he was aware of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">himself again. Frodo, neither the Voice nor the Eye: free to choose, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with one remaining instant in which to do so. He took the Ring off his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">finger. He was kneeling in clear sunlight before the high seat. A black<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shadow seemed to pass like an arm above him; it missed Amon Hen and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">groped<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">out west, and faded. Then all the sky was clean and blue and birds sang in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">every tree.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo rose to his feet. A great weariness was on him, but his will was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">firm and his heart lighter. He spoke aloud to himself. T will do now what I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">must,' he said. This at least is plain: the evil of the Ring is already at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">work even in the Company, and the Ring must leave them before it does more<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">harm. I will go alone. Some I cannot trust, and those I can trust are too<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">dear to me: poor old Sam, and Merry and Pippin. Strider, too: his heart<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">yearns for Minas Tirith, and he will be needed there, now Boromir has fallen<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">into evil. I will go alone. At once.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">He went quickly down the path and came back to the lawn where Boromir<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">had found him. Then he halted, listening. He thought he could hear cries and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">calls from the woods near the shore below.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'They'll be hunting for me,' he said. T wonder how long I have been<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">away. Hours, I should think.' He hesitated. 'What can I do? ' he muttered.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I must go now or I shall never go. I shan't get a chance again. I hate<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">leaving them, and like this without any explanation. But surely they will<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">understand. Sam will. And what else can I do?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Slowly he drew out the Ring and put it on once more. He vanished and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">passed down the hill, less than a rustle of the wind.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">The others remained long by the river -side. For some time they had been<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">silent, moving restlessly about; but now they were sitting in a circle, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">they were talking. Every now and again they made efforts to speak of other<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">things, of their long road and many adventures; they questioned Aragorn<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">concerning the realm of Gondor and its ancient history, and the remnants of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">its great works that could still be seen in this strange border -land of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Emyn Muil: the stone kings and the seats of Lhaw and Hen, and the great<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Stair beside the falls of Rauros. But always their thoughts and words<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">strayed back to Frodo and the Ring. What would Frodo choose to do? Why<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he hesitating?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'He is debating which course is the most desperate, I think,â€™ said<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Aragorn. 'And well he may. It is now more hopeless than ever for the Company<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to go east, since we have been tracked by Gollum, and must fear that the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">secret of our journey is already betrayed. But Minas Tirith is no nearer to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Fire and the destruction of the Burden.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'We may remain there for a while and make a brave stand; but the Lord<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Denethor and all his men cannot hope to do what even Elrond said was beyond<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his power: either to keep the Burden secret, or to hold off the full might<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of the Enemy when he comes to take it. Which way would any of us choose in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodoâ€™s place? I do not know. Now indeed we miss Gandalf most.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™Grievous is our loss,â€™ said Legolas. â€™Yet we must needs make up our<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">minds without his aid. Why cannot we decide, and so help Frodo? Let us call<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">him back and then vote! I should vote for Minas Tirith.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'And so should I,â€™ said Gimli. â€™We, of course, were only sent to help<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the Bearer along the road, to go no further than we wished; and none of us<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">is under any oath or command to seek Mount Doom. Hard was my parting<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Lothlurien. Yet I have come so far, and I say this: now we have reached the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">last choice, it is clear to me that I cannot leave Frodo. I would choose<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Minas Tirith, but if he does not, then I follow him.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'And I too will go with him,â€™ said Legolas. 'It would be faithless now<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to say farewell.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™It would indeed be a betrayal, if we all left him,â€™ said Aragorn. â€™But<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">if he goes east, then all need not go with him; nor do I think that all<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">should. That venture is desperate: as much so for eight as for three or two,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">or one alone. If you would let me choose, then I should appoint three<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">companions: Sam, who could not bear it otherwise; and Gimli; and myself.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Boromir will return to his own city, where his father and his people need<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">him; and with him the others should go, or at least Meriadoc and Peregrin,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">if Legolas is not willing to leave us.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'That wonâ€™t do at all! ' cried Merry. 'We can't leave Frodo! Pippin and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">I always intended to go wherever he went, and we still do. But we did not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">realize what that would mean. It seemed different so far away, in the Shire<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">or in Ri vendell. It would be mad and cruel to let Frodo go to Mordor. Why<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">can't we stop him?'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'We must stop him,' said Pippin. 'And that is what he is worrying<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">about, I am sure. He knows we shan't agree to his going east. And he doesn't<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">like to ask anyone to go with him, poor old fellow. Imagine it: going off to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Mordor alone! ' Pippin shuddered. 'But the dear silly old hobbit, he ought<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to know that he hasn't got to ask. He ought to know that if we can't stop<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">him, we shan't leave him.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Begging your pardon,' said Sam. 'I don't think you understand my<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">master at all. He isn't hesitating about which way to go. Of course not!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">What's the good of Minas Tirith anyway? To him, I mean, begging your<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">pardon,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Master Boromir,' he added, and turned. It was then that they discovered that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Boromir, who at first had been sitting silent on the outside of the circle,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">was no longer there.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Now where's he got to? ' cried Sam, looking worried. 'He's been a bit<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">queer lately, to my mind. But anyway he's not in this business. He's off to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his home, as he always said; and no blame to him. But Mr. Frodo, he knows<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he's got to find the Cracks of Doom, if he can. But he's afraid. Now it's<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">come to the point, he's just plain terrified. That's what his trouble is. Of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">course he's had a bit of schooling, so to speak-we all have-since we left<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">home, or he'd be so terrified he'd just fling the Ring in the River and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">bolt. But he's still too frightened to start. And he isn't worrying about us<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">either: whether we'll go along with him or no. He knows we mean to. That's<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">another thing that's bothering him. If he screws himself up to go, he'll<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">want to go alone. Mark my words! We're going to have trouble when he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">comes<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">back. For he'll screw himself up all right, as sure as his name's Baggins.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I believe you speak more wisely than any of us, Sam,' said Aragorn.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'And what shall we do, if you prove right? â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Stop him! Don't let him go! ' cried Pippin.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I wonder? ' said Aragorn. 'He is the Bearer, and the fate of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Burden is on him. I do not think that it is our part to drive him one way or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the other. Nor do I think that we should succeed, if we tried. There are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">other powers at work far stronger.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Well, I wish Frodo would "screw himself up" and come back, and let us<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">get it over,' said Pippin. 'This waiting is horrible! Surely the time is up?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">f<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Yes,' said Aragorn. 'The hour is long passed. The morning is wearing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">away. We must call for him.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At that moment Boromir reappeared. He came out from the trees and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">walked towards them without speaking. His face looked grim and sad. He<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">paused as if counting those that were present, and then sat down aloof, with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">his eyes on the ground.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Where have you been, Boromir? â€™ asked Aragorn. 'Have you seen Frodo? â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Boromir hesitated for a second. 'Yes, and no,â€™ he answered slowly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Yes: I found him some way up the hill, and I spoke to him. I urged him to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">come to Minas Tirith and not to go east. I grew angry and he left me. He<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">vanished. I have never seen such a thing happen before, though I have heard<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">of it in tales. He must have put the Ring on. I could not find him again. I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">thought he would return to you.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Is that all that you have to say? ' said Aragorn, looking hard and not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">too kindly at Boromir.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Yes,' he answered. 'I will say no more yet.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'This is bad!' cried Sam, jumping up. 'I don't know what this Man has<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">been up to. Why should Mr. Frodo put the thing on? He didn't ought to have;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and if he has, goodness knows what may have happened!'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'But he wouldn't keep it on' 1 said Merry. 'Not when he had escaped the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">unwelcome visitor, like Bilbo used to.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'But where did he go? Where is he? ' cried Pippin. 'He's been away ages<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">now.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'How long is it since you saw Frodo last, Boromir? ' asked Aragorn.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Half an hour, maybe,' he answered. 'Or it might be an hour. I have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">wandered for some time since. I do not know! I do not know! ' He put his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">head in his hands, and sat as if bowed with grief.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'An hour since he vanished! ' shouted Sam. 'We must try and find him at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">once. Come on! â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Wait a moment! ' cried Aragorn. 'We must divide up into pairs, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">arrange-here, hold on! Wait! '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">It was no good. They took no notice of him. Sam had dashed off first.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Merry and Pippin had followed, and were already disappearing westward into<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the trees by the shore, shouting: Frodo! Frodo ! in their clear, high<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hobbit- voices. Legolas and Gimli were running. A sudden panic or madness<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">seemed to have fallen on the Company.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'We shall all be scattered and lost,â€™ groaned Aragorn. 'Boromir! I do<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">not know what part you have played in this mischief, but help now! Go after<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">those two young hobbits, and guard them at the least, even if you cannot<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">find Frodo. Come back to this spot, if you find him, or any traces of him. I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shall return soon.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Aragorn sprang swiftly away and went in pursuit of Sam. Just as he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">reached the little lawn among the rowans he overtook him, toiling uphill,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">panting and calling, Frodo!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Come with me, Sam! â€™ he said. 'None of us should be alone. There is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">mischief about. I feel it. I am going to the top, to the Seat of Amon Hen,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to see what may be seen. And look! It is as my heart guessed, Frodo went<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">this way. Follow me, and keep your eyes open! ' He sped up the path.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sam did his best, but he could not keep up with Strider the Ranger, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">soon fell behind. He had not gone far before Aragorn was out of sight ahead.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sam stopped and puffed. Suddenly he clapped his hand to his head.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Whoa, Sam Gamgee! â€™ he said aloud. 'Your legs are too short, so use<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">your head! Let me see now! Boromir isn't lying, that's not his way; but he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hasn't told us everything. Something scared Mr. Frodo badly. He screwed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">himself up to the point, sudden. He made up his mind at last to go. Where<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to? Off East. Not without Sam? Yes, without even his Sam. That's hard, cruel<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hard.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sam passed his hand over his eyes, brushing away the tears. 'Steady,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Gamgee! ' he said. 'Think, if you can! He can't fly across rivers, and he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">can't jump waterfalls. He's got no gear. So he's got to get back to the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">boats. Back to the boats! Back to the boats, Sam, like lightning! '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Sam turned and bolted back down the path. He fell and cut his knees. Up<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">he got and ran on. He came to the edge of the lawn of Parth Galen by the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">shore, where the boats were drawn up out of the water. No one was there.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">There seemed to be cries in the woods behind, but he did not heed them. He<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stood gazing for a moment, stock-still, gaping. A boat was sliding down the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">bank all by itself. With a shout Sam raced across the grass. The boat<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">slipped into the wat<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">128d<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">er.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Coming, Mr. Frodo! Coming! ' called Sam, and flung himself from the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">bank, clutching at the departing boat. He missed it by a yard. With a cry<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and a splash he fell face downward into deep swift water. Gurgling he went<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">under, and the River closed over his curly head.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">An exclamation of dismay came from the empty boat. A paddle swirled and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the boat put about. Frodo was just in time to grasp Sam by the hair as he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">came up, bubbling and struggling. Fear was staring in his round brown eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Up you come, Sam my lad! â€™ said Frodo. 'Now take my hand! '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Save me, Mr. Frodo! â€™ gasped Sam. 'I'm drownded. I canâ€™t see your<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">hand.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Here it is. Don't pinch, lad! I wonâ€™t let you go. Tread water and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">donâ€™t flounder, or you'll upset the boat. There now, get hold of the side,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">and let me use the paddle! '<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">With a few strokes Frodo brought the boat back to the bank, and Sam was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">able to scramble out, wet as a water-rat. Frodo took off the Ring and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">stepped ashore again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Of all the confounded nuisances you are the worst, Sam! â€™ he said.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™Oh, Mr. Frodo, thatâ€™s hard! â€™ said Sam shivering. 'Thatâ€™s hard, trying<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">to go without me and all. If I hadnâ€™t a guessed right, where would you be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">now? â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Safely on my way.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Safely! â€™ said Sam. 'All alone and without me to help you? I couldnâ€™t<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">have a borne it, itâ€™d have been the death of me.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">â€™It would be the death of you to come with me, Sam,â€™ said Frodo and I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">could not have borne that.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Not as certain as being left behind,â€™ said Sam.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'But I am going to Mordor.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'I know that well enough, Mr. Frodo. Of course you are. And Iâ€™m coming<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">with you.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Now, Sam,â€™ said Frodo, 'donâ€™t hinder me! The others will be coming<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">back at any minute. If they catch me here. I shall have to argue and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">explain, and I shall never have the heart or the chance to get off. But I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">must go at once. It's the only way.â€™<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Of course it is,' answered Sam. 'But not alone. I'm coming too, or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">neither of us isnâ€™t going. I'll knock holes in all the boats first.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Frodo actually laughed. A sudden warmth and gladness touched his heart.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Leave one! 'he said. 'We'll need it. But you can't come like this without<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">your gear or food or anything.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Just hold on a moment, and I'll get my stuff!' cried Sam eagerly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'It's all ready. I thought we should be off today.' He rushed to the camping<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">place, fished out his pack from the pile where Frodo had laid it when he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">emptied the boat of his companions' goods grabbed a spare blanket, and some<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">extra packages of food, and ran back.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'So all my plan is spoilt! â€™ said Frodo. 'It is no good trying to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">escape you. But Iâ€™m glad, Sam. I cannot tell you how glad. Come along! It is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">plain that we were meant to go together. We will go, and may the others find<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">a safe road! Strider will look after them. I don't suppose we shall see them<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">again.'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">'Yet we may, Mr Frodo. We may,' said Sam.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">So Frodo and Sam set off on the last stage of the Quest together. Frodo<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">paddled away from the shore, and the River bore them swiftly away, down the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">western arm, and past the frowning cliffs of Tol Brandir. The roar of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">great falls drew nearer. Even with such help as Sam could give, it was hard<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">work to pass across the current at the southward end of the island and drive<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">the boat eastward towards the far shore.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">At length they came to land again upon the southern slopes of Amon<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Lhaw. There they found a shelving shore, and they drew the boat out, high<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">above the water, and hid it as well as they could behind a great boulder.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Then shouldering their burdens, they set off, seeking a path that would<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">bring them over the grey hills of the Emyn Muil, and down into the Land of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3">Shadow.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
