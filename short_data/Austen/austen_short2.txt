\f0\fs24 \cf0 We allude with a special touch of affection to Anne Eliot. "Persuasion,"\
which was written during the last two years of Miss Austen's life, when\
the refining touch of Eternity was already upon her, has always seemed\
to us the most perfect of her novels; and Anne, with her exquisite\
breeding and unselfish straightforwardness, just touched with the tender\
reserve of memory and regret, one of her best portraitures. But this is\
a matter of individual taste. Doubtless Elizabeth Bennet is "better fun"\
as the modern girl would say. Miss Austen herself preferred her. She had\
a droll and pretty way of talking about her characters which showed how\
real they were to her own mind, and made them equally real to other\
people. In 1813 she had the good luck to light upon a portrait of Jane\
Bennet at an exhibition.\
\
      "I was very well pleased (pray tell Fanny) with a\
      small portrait of Mrs. Bingley, excessively like her.\
      I went in hopes of seeing one of her sister, but there\
      was no Mrs. Darcy. Perhaps I may find her in the great\
      exhibition, which we shall go to if we have time. Mrs.\
      Bingley's is exactly like herself,--size, shaped face,\
      features and sweetness; there never was a greater\
      likeness. She is dressed in a white gown, with green\
      ornaments, which convinces me of what I had always\
      supposed, that green was a favorite color with her. I\
      dare say Mrs. D. will be in yellow."\
\
And later:--\
\
      "We have been both to the exhibition and Sir J.\
      Reynolds'; and I am disappointed, for there was\
      nothing like Mrs. D. at either. I can only imagine\
      that Mr. D. prizes any picture of her too much to like\
      it should be exposed to the public eye. I can imagine\
      he would have that sort of feeling,--that mixture of\
      love, pride, and delicacy."\
\
The letters included in this series comprise about three quarters of the\
collection in two volumes published in 1884 by her great-nephew Lord\
Brabourne. The lightness, almost friskiness, of their tone cannot fail\
to strike the reader. Modern letters written by women are filled more or\
less with hints and queries; questionings as to the why and the\
wherefore occur; allusions to the various "fads" of the day, literary or\
artistic,--Ibsen, Tolstoi, Browning, Esoteric Buddhism, Wagner's Music,\
the Mind Cure, Social Science, Causes and Reforms. But Cowper and Crabbe\
were the poetical sensations in Miss Austen's time, Scott and Byron its\
phenomenal novelties; it took months to get most books printed, and\
years to persuade anybody to read them. Furthermore the letters, in all\
probability, are carefully chosen to reveal only the more superficial\
side of their writer. There are wide gaps of omission, covering\
important events such as Mr. Austen's death, the long illness through\
which Jane nursed her brother Henry, and the anxieties and worries which\
his failure in business caused to the whole family. What is vouchsafed\
us is a glimpse of the girlish and untroubled moments of Miss Austen's\
life; and the glimpse is a sweet and friendly one. We are glad to have\
it, in spite of our suspicion that another and even more interesting\
part of her personality is withheld from us.}
