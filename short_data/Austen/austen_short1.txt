\f0\fs24 \cf0 THE recent cult for Miss Austen, which has resulted in no less than ten\
new editions of her novels within a decade and three memoirs by\
different hands within as many years, have made the facts of her life\
familiar to most readers. It was a short life, and an uneventful one as\
viewed from the standpoint of our modern times, when steam and\
electricity have linked together the ends of the earth, and the very air\
seems teeming with news, agitations, discussions. We have barely time to\
recover our breath between post and post; and the morning paper with its\
statements of disaster and its hints of still greater evils to be, is\
scarcely out-lived, when, lo! in comes the evening issue, contradicting\
the news of the morning, to be sure, but full of omens and auguries of\
its own to strew our pillows with the seed of wakefulness.\
\
To us, publications come hot and hot from the press. Telegraphic wires\
like the intricate and incalculable zigzags of the lightning ramify\
above our heads; and who can tell at what moment their darts may\
strike? In Miss Austen's day the tranquil, drowsy, decorous English day\
of a century since, all was different. News travelled then from hand to\
hand, carried in creaking post-wagons, or in cases of extreme urgency by\
men on horseback. When a gentleman journeying in his own "chaise" took\
three days in going from Exeter to London, a distance now covered in\
three hours of railroad, there was little chance of frequent surprises.\
Love, sorrow, and death were in the world then as now, and worked their\
will upon the sons of men; but people did not expect happenings every\
day or even every year. No doubt they lived the longer for this\
exemption from excitement, and kept their nerves in a state of wholesome\
repair; but it goes without saying that the events of which they knew so\
little did not stir them deeply.\
\
Miss Austen's life coincided with two of the momentous epochs of\
history,--the American struggle for independence, and the French\
Revolution; but there is scarcely an allusion to either in her letters.\
She was interested in the fleet and its victories because two of her\
brothers were in the navy and had promotion and prize-money to look\
forward to. In this connection she mentions Trafalgar and the Egyptian\
expedition, and generously remarks that she would read Southey's "Life\
of Nelson" if there was anything in it about her brother Frank! She\
honors Sir John Moore by remarking after his death that his mother\
would perhaps have preferred to have him less distinguished and still\
alive; further than that, the making of the gooseberry jam and a good\
recipe for orange wine interests her more than all the marchings and\
countermarchings, the manoeuvres and diplomacies, going on the world\
over. In the midst of the universal vortex of fear and hope, triumph and\
defeat, while the fate of Britain and British liberty hung trembling in\
the balance, she sits writing her letters, trimming her caps, and\
discussing small beer with her sister in a lively and unruffled fashion\
wonderful to contemplate. "The society of rural England in those days,"\
as Mr. Goldwin Smith happily puts it, "enjoyed a calm of its own in the\
midst of the European tempest like the windless centre of a circular\
storm."\
\
The point of view of a woman with such an environment must naturally be\
circumscribed and narrow; and in this Miss Austen's charm consists.\
Seeing little, she painted what she saw with absolute fidelity and a\
dexterity and perfection unequalled. "On her was bestowed, though in a\
humble form, the gift which had been bestowed on Homer, Shakespeare,\
Cervantes, Scott, and a few others,--the gift of creative power."\
Endowed with the keenest and most delicate insight and a vivid sense of\
humor, she depicted with exactitude what she observed and what she\
understood, giving to each fact and emotion its precise shade and\
value. The things she did not see she did not attempt. Affectation was\
impossible to her,--most of all, affectation of knowledge or feeling not\
justly her own. "She held the mirror up to her time" with an exquisite\
sincerity and fidelity; and the closeness of her study brought her\
intimately near to those hidden springs which underlie all human nature.\
This is the reason why, for all their skimp skirts, leg-of-mutton\
sleeves, and bygone impossible bonnets, her characters do not seem to us\
old-fashioned. Minds and hearts are made pretty much after the same\
pattern from century to century; and given a modern dress and speech,\
Emma or Elizabeth or dear Anne Eliot could enter a drawing-room to-day,\
and excite no surprise except by so closely resembling the people whom\
they would find there.\
\
"Miss Austen's novels are dateless things," Mr. Augustine Birrell tells\
us. "Nobody in his senses would speak of them as 'old novels.' 'John\
Inglesant' is an old novel, so is 'Ginx's Baby.' But Emma is quite new,\
and, like a wise woman, affords few clues to her age."\
