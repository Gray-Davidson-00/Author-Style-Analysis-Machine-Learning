 1 ¶ My spirit is consumed, my days are extinct, the grave is ready for me. 
 2  Surely there are mockers with me, and mine eye abideth in their provocation. 
 3  Give now a pledge, be surety for me with Thyself; who else is there that will strike hands with me? 
 4  For Thou hast hid their heart from understanding; therefore shalt Thou not exalt them. 
 5  He that denounceth his friends for the sake of flattery, even the eyes of his children shall fail. 
 6  He hath made me also a byword of the people; and I am become one in whose face they spit. 
 7  Mine eye also is dimmed by reason of vexation, and all my members are as a shadow. 
 8  Upright men are astonished at this, and the innocent stirreth up himself against the godless. 
 9  Yet the righteous holdeth on his way, and he that hath clean hands waxeth stronger and stronger. 
 10 ¶ But as for you all, do ye return, and come now; and I shall not find a wise man among you. 
 11  My days are past, my purposes are broken off, even the thoughts of my heart. 
 12  They change the night into day; the light is short because of darkness. 
 13  If I look for the nether-world as my house; if I have spread my couch in the darkness; 
 14  If I have said to corruption: 'Thou art my father', to the worm: 'Thou art my mother, and my sister'; 
 15  Where then is my hope? And as for my hope, who shall see it? 
 16  They shall go down to the bars of the nether-world, when we are at rest together in the dust.
