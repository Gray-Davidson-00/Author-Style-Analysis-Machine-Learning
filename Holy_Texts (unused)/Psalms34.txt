 1 ¶ (34:1) A Psalm of David; when he changed his demeanour before Abimelech, who drove him away, and he departed. (34:2) I will bless the LORD at all times; His praise shall continually be in my mouth. 
 2  (34:3) My soul shall glory in the LORD; the humble shall hear thereof, and be glad. 
 3  (34:4) O magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt His name together. 
 4  (34:5) I sought the LORD, and He answered me, and delivered me from all my fears. 
 5  (34:6) They looked unto Him, and were radiant; and their faces shall never be abashed. 
 6  (34:7) This poor man cried, and the LORD heard, and saved him out of all his troubles. 
 7  (34:8) The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear Him, and delivereth them. 
 8  (34:9) O consider and see that the LORD is good; happy is the man that taketh refuge in Him. 
 9  (34:10) O fear the LORD, ye His holy ones; for there is no want to them that fear Him. 
 10  (34:11) The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger; but they that seek the LORD want not any good thing. 
 11 ¶ (34:12) Come, ye children, hearken unto me; I will teach you the fear of the LORD. 
 12  (34:13) Who is the man that desireth life, and loveth days, that he may see good therein? 
 13  (34:14) Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile. 
 14  (34:15) Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it. 
 15  (34:16) The eyes of the LORD are toward the righteous, and His ears are open unto their cry. 
 16  (34:17) The face of the LORD is against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth. 
 17  (34:18) They cried, and the LORD heard, and delivered them out of all their troubles. 
 18  (34:19) The LORD is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart, and saveth such as are of a contrite spirit. 
 19  (34:20) Many are the ills of the righteous, but the LORD delivereth him out of them all. 
 20  (34:21) He keepeth all his bones; not one of them is broken. 
 21  (34:22) Evil shall kill the wicked; and they that hate the righteous shall be held guilty. 
 22  (34:23) The LORD redeemeth the soul of His servants; and none of them that take refuge in Him shall be desolate.
