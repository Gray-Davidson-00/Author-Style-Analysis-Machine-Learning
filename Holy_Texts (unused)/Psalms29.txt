 1 ¶ A Psalm of David. Ascribe unto the LORD, O ye sons of might, ascribe unto the LORD glory and strength. 
 2  Ascribe unto the LORD the glory due unto His name; worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness. 
 3  The voice of the LORD is upon the waters; the God of glory thundereth, even the LORD upon many waters. 
 4  The voice of the LORD is powerful; the voice of the LORD is full of majesty. 
 5  The voice of the LORD breaketh the cedars; yea, the LORD breaketh in pieces the cedars of Lebanon. 
 6  He maketh them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like a young wild-ox. 
 7  The voice of the LORD heweth out flames of fire. 
 8  The voice of the LORD shaketh the wilderness; the LORD shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh. 
 9  The voice of the LORD maketh the hinds to calve, and strippeth the forests bare; and in His temple all say: 'Glory.' 
 10  The LORD sat enthroned at the flood; yea, the LORD sitteth as King for ever. 
 11  The LORD will give strength unto His people; the LORD will bless his people with peace.
