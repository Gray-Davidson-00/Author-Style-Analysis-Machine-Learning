 1 ¶ (55:1) For the Leader; with string-music. Maschil of David. (55:2) Give ear, O God, to my prayer; and hide not Thyself from my supplication. 
 2  (55:3) Attend unto me, and hear me; I am distraught in my complaint, and will moan; 
 3  (55:4) Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked; for they cast mischief upon me, and in anger they persecute me. 
 4  (55:5) My heart doth writhe within me; and the terrors of death are fallen upon me. 
 5  (55:6) Fear and trembling come upon me, and horror hath overwhelmed me. 
 6  (55:7) And I said: 'Oh that I had wings like a dove! then would I fly away, and be at rest. 
 7  (55:8) Lo, then would I wander far off, I would lodge in the wilderness. Selah 
 8  (55:9) I would haste me to a shelter from the stormy wind and tempest.' 
 9 ¶ (55:10) Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongue; for I have seen violence and strife in the city. 
 10  (55:11) Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof; iniquity also and mischief are in the midst of it. 
 11  (55:12) Wickedness is in the midst thereof; oppression and guile depart not from her broad place. 
 12  (55:13) For it was not an enemy that taunted me, then I could have borne it; neither was it mine adversary that did magnify himself against me, then I would have hid myself from him. 
 13  (55:14) But it was thou, a man mine equal, my companion, and my familiar friend; 
 14  (55:15) We took sweet counsel together, in the house of God we walked with the throng. 
 15  (55:16) May He incite death against them, let them go down alive into the nether-world; for evil is in their dwelling, and within them. 
 16 ¶ (55:17) As for me, I will call upon God; and the LORD shall save me. 
 17  (55:18) Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I complain, and moan; and He hath heard my voice. 
 18  (55:19) He hath redeemed my soul in peace so that none came nigh me; for they were many that strove with me. 
 19  (55:20) God shall hear, and humble them, even He that is enthroned of old, Selah, such as have no changes, and fear not God. 
 20  (55:21) He hath put forth his hands against them that were at peace with him; he hath profaned his covenant. 
 21  (55:22) Smoother than cream were the speeches of his mouth, but his heart was war; his words were softer than oil, yet were they keen-edged swords. 
 22  (55:23) Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and He will sustain thee; He will never suffer the righteous to be moved. 
 23  (55:24) But Thou, O God, wilt bring them down into the nethermost pit; men of blood and deceit shall not live out half their days; but as for me, I will trust in Thee.
