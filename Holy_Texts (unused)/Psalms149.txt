 1 ¶ Hallelujah. Sing unto the LORD a new song, and His praise in the assembly of the saints. 
 2  Let Israel rejoice in his Maker; let the children of Zion be joyful in their King. 
 3  Let them praise His name in the dance; let them sing praises unto Him with the timbrel and harp. 
 4  For the LORD taketh pleasure in His people; He adorneth the humble with salvation. 
 5  Let the saints exult in glory; let them sing for joy upon their beds. 
 6 ¶ Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, and a two-edged sword in their hand; 
 7  To execute vengeance upon the nations, and chastisements upon the peoples; 
 8  To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron; 
 9  To execute upon them the judgment written; He is the glory of all His saints. Hallelujah.
