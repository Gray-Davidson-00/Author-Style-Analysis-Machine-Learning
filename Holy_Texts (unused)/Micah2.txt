 1 ¶ Woe to them that devise iniquity and work evil upon their beds! When the morning is light, they execute it, because it is in the power of their hand. 
 2  And they covet fields, and seize them; and houses, and take them away; thus they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage. 
 3  Therefore thus saith the LORD: Behold, against this family do I devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks, neither shall ye walk upright; for it shall be an evil time. 
 4  In that day shall they take up a parable against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation, and say: 'We are utterly ruined; he changeth the portion of my people; how doth he remove it from me! Instead of restoring our fields, he divideth them.' 
 5  Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast the line by lot in the congregation of the LORD. 
 6 ¶ 'Preach ye not', they preach; 'They shall not preach of these things, that they shall not take shame.' 
 7  Do I change, O house of Jacob? Is the spirit of the LORD straitened? Are these His doings? Do not My words do good to him that walketh uprightly? 
 8  But of late My people is risen up as an enemy; with the garment ye strip also the mantle from them that pass by securely, so that they are as men returning from war. 
 9  The women of My people ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their young children ye take away My glory for ever. 
 10  Arise ye, and depart; for this is not your resting-place; because of the uncleanness thereof, it shall destroy you, even with a sore destruction. 
 11  If a man walking in wind and falsehood do lie: 'I will preach unto thee of wine and of strong drink'; he shall even be the preacher of this people. 
 12 ¶ I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will render them all as sheep in a fold; as a flock in the midst of their pasture; they shall make great noise by reason of the multitude of men. 
 13  The breaker is gone up before them; they have broken forth and passed on, by the gate, and are gone out thereat; and their king is passed on before them, and the LORD at the head of them.
