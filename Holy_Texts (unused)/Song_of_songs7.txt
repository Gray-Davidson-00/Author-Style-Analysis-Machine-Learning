 1 ¶ (7:2) How beautiful are thy steps in sandals, O prince's daughter! The roundings of thy thighs are like the links of a chain, the work of the hands of a skilled workman. 
 2  (7:3) Thy navel is like a round goblet, wherein no mingled wine is wanting; thy belly is like a heap of wheat set about with lilies. 
 3  (7:4) Thy two breasts are like two fawns that are twins of a gazelle. 
 4  (7:5) Thy neck is as a tower of ivory; thine eyes as the pools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bath-rabbim; thy nose is like the tower of Lebanon which looketh toward Damascus. 
 5  (7:6) Thy head upon thee is like Carmel, and the hair of thy head like purple; the king is held captive in the tresses thereof. 
 6  (7:7) How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights! 
 7  (7:8) This thy stature is like to a palm-tree, and thy breasts to clusters of grapes. 
 8  (7:9) I said: 'I will climb up into the palm-tree, I will take hold of the branches thereof; and let thy breasts be as clusters of the vine, and the smell of thy countenance like apples; 
 9  (7:10) And the roof of thy mouth like the best wine, that glideth down smoothly for my beloved, moving gently the lips of those that are asleep.' 
 10 ¶ (7:11) I am my beloved's, and his desire is toward me. 
 11  (7:12) Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; let us lodge in the villages. 
 12  (7:13) Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see whether the vine hath budded, whether the vine-blossom be opened, and the pomegranates be in flower; there will I give thee my love. 
 13  (7:14) The mandrakes give forth fragrance, and at our doors are all manner of precious fruits, new and old, which I have laid up for thee, O my beloved.
