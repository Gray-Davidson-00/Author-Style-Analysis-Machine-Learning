 1 ¶ The burden of the word of the LORD. In the land of Hadrach, and in Damascus shall be His resting-place; for the LORD'S is the eye of man and all the tribes of Israel. 
 2  And Hamath also shall border thereon; Tyre and Zidon, for she is very wise. 
 3  And Tyre did build herself a stronghold, and heaped up silver as the dust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets. 
 4  Behold, the Lord will impoverish her, and He will smite her power into the sea; and she shall be devoured with fire. 
 5  Ashkelon shall see it, and fear, Gaza also, and shall be sore pained, and Ekron, for her expectation shall be ashamed; and the king shall perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited. 
 6  And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines. 
 7  And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his detestable things from between his teeth, and he also shall be a remnant for our God; and he shall be as a chief in Judah, and Ekron as a Jebusite. 
 8  And I will encamp about My house against the army, that none pass through or return; and no oppressor shall pass through them any more; for now have I seen with Mine eyes. 
 9 ¶ Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion, shout, O daughter of Jerusalem; behold, thy king cometh unto thee, he is triumphant, and victorious, lowly, and riding upon an ass, even upon a colt the foal of an ass. 
 10  And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem, and the battle bow shall be cut off, and he shall speak peace unto the nations; and his dominion shall be from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth. 
 11  As for thee also, because of the blood of thy covenant I send forth thy prisoners out of the pit wherein is no water. 
 12 ¶ Return to the stronghold, ye prisoners of hope; even to-day do I declare that I will render double unto thee. 
 13  For I bend Judah for Me, I fill the bow with Ephraim; and I will stir up thy sons, O Zion, against thy sons, O Javan, and will make thee as the sword of a mighty man. 
 14  And the LORD shall be seen over them, and His arrow shall go forth as the lightning; and the Lord GOD will blow the horn, and will go with whirlwinds of the south. 
 15  The LORD of hosts will defend them; and they shall devour, and shall tread down the sling-stones; and they shall drink, and make a noise as through wine; and they shall be filled like the basins, like the corners of the altar. 
 16  And the LORD their God shall save them in that day as the flock of His people; for they shall be as the stones of a crown, glittering over His land. 
 17  For how great is their goodness, and how great is their beauty! Corn shall make the young men flourish, and new wine the maids.
