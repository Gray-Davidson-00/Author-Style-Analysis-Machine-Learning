 1 ¶ Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said: 
 2  Dominion and fear are with Him; He maketh peace in His high places. 
 3  Is there any number of His armies? And upon whom doth not His light arise? 
 4  How then can man be just with God? Or how can he be clean that is born of a woman? 
 5  Behold, even the moon hath no brightness, and the stars are not pure in His sight; 
 6  How much less man, that is a worm! and the son of man, that is a maggot!
