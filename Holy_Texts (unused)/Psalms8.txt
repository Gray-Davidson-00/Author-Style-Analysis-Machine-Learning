 1 ¶ (8:1) For the Leader; upon the Gittith. A Psalm of David. (8:2) O LORD, our Lord, how glorious is Thy name in all the earth! whose majesty is rehearsed above the heavens. 
 2  (8:3) Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast Thou founded strength, because of Thine adversaries; that Thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger. 
 3 ¶ (8:4) When I behold Thy heavens, the work of Thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which Thou hast established; 
 4  (8:5) What is man, that Thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that Thou thinkest of him? 
 5  (8:6) Yet Thou hast made him but little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour. 
 6  (8:7) Thou hast made him to have dominion over the works of Thy hands; Thou hast put all things under His feet: 
 7  (8:8) Sheep and oxen, all of them, yea, and the beasts of the field; 
 8  (8:9) The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea; whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas. 
 9  (8:10) O LORD, our Lord, how glorious is Thy name in all the earth!
