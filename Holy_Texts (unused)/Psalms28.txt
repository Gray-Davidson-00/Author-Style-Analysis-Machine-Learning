 1 ¶ A Psalm of David. Unto thee, O LORD, do I call; my Rock, be not Thou deaf unto me; lest, if Thou be silent unto me, I become like them that go down into the pit. 
 2  Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto Thee, when I lift up my hands toward Thy holy Sanctuary. 
 3  Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of iniquity; who speak peace with their neighbours, but evil is in their hearts. 
 4  Give them according to their deeds, and according to the evil of their endeavours; give them after the work of their hands; render to them their desert. 
 5  Because they give no heed to the works of the LORD, nor to the operation of His hands; He will break them down and not build them up. 
 6 ¶ Blessed be the LORD, because He hath heard the voice of my supplications. 
 7  The LORD is my strength and my shield, in Him hath my heart trusted, and I am helped; therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth, and with my song will I praise Him. 
 8  The LORD is a strength unto them; and He is a stronghold of salvation to His anointed. 
 9  Save Thy people, and bless Thine inheritance; and tend them, and carry them for ever.
