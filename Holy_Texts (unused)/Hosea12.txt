 1 ¶ (12:2) Ephraim striveth after wind, and followeth after the east wind; all the day he multiplieth lies and desolation; and they make a covenant with Assyria, and oil is carried into Egypt. 
 2  (12:3) The LORD hath also a controversy with Judah, and will punish Jacob according to his ways, according to his doings will He recompense him. 
 3  (12:4) In the womb he took his brother by the heel, and by his strength he strove with a godlike being; 
 4  (12:5) So he strove with an angel, and prevailed; he wept, and made supplication unto him; at Beth-el he would find him, and there he would speak with us; 
 5  (12:6) But the LORD, the God of hosts, the LORD is His name. 
 6  (12:7) Therefore turn thou to thy God; keep mercy and justice, and wait for thy God continually. 
 7 ¶ (12:8) As for the trafficker, the balances of deceit are in his hand. He loveth to oppress. 
 8  (12:9) And Ephraim said: 'Surely I am become rich, I have found me wealth; in all my labours they shall find in me no iniquity that were sin.' 
 9  (12:10) But I am the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt; I will yet again make thee to dwell in tents, as in the days of the appointed season. 
 10  (12:11) I have also spoken unto the prophets, and I have multiplied visions; and by the ministry of the prophets have I used similitudes. 
 11  (12:12) If Gilead be given to iniquity becoming altogether vanity, in Gilgal they sacrifice unto bullocks; yea, their altars shall be as heaps in the furrows of the field. 
 12  (12:13) And Jacob fled into the field of Aram, and Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he kept sheep. 
 13  (12:14) And by a prophet the LORD brought Israel up out of Egypt, and by a prophet was he kept. 
 14  (12:15) Ephraim hath provoked most bitterly; therefore shall his blood be cast upon him, and his reproach shall his Lord return unto him.
