 4  (53:5) 'Shall not the workers of iniquity know it, who eat up My people as they eat bread, and call not upon God?' 
 5  (53:6) There are they in great fear, where no fear was; for God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee; Thou hast put them to shame, because God hath rejected them. 
 6  (53:7) Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When God turneth the captivity of His people, let Jacob rejoice, let Israel be glad.
