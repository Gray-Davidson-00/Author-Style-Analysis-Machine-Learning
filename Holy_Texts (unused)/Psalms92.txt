 1 ¶ (92:1) A Psalm, a Song. For the sabbath day. (92:2) It is a good thing to give thanks unto the LORD, and to sing praises unto Thy name, O Most High; 
 2  (92:3) To declare Thy lovingkindness in the morning, and Thy faithfulness in the night seasons, 
 3  (92:4) With an instrument of ten strings, and with the psaltery; with a solemn sound upon the harp. 
 4  (92:5) For Thou, LORD, hast made me glad through Thy work; I will exult in the works of Thy hands. 
 5  (92:6) How great are Thy works, O LORD! Thy thoughts are very deep. 
 6  (92:7) A brutish man knoweth not, neither doth a fool understand this. 
 7 ¶ (92:8) When the wicked spring up as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; it is that they may be destroyed for ever. 
 8  (92:9) But Thou, O LORD, art on high for evermore. 
 9  (92:10) For, lo, Thine enemies, O LORD, for, lo, Thine enemies shall perish: all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered. 
 10  (92:11) But my horn hast Thou exalted like the horn of the wild-ox; I am anointed with rich oil. 
 11  (92:12) Mine eye also hath gazed on them that lie in wait for me, mine ears have heard my desire of the evil-doers that rise up against me. 
 12  (92:13) The righteous shall flourish like the palm-tree; he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon. 
 13  (92:14) Planted in the house of the LORD, they shall flourish in the courts of our God. 
 14  (92:15) They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be full of sap and richness; 
 15  (92:16) To declare that the LORD is upright, my Rock, in whom there is no unrighteousness.
