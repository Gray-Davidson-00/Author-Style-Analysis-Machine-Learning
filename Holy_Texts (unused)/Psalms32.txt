 1 ¶ A Psalm of David. Maschil. Happy is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is pardoned. 
 2  Happy is the man unto whom the LORD counteth not iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile. 
 3  When I kept silence, my bones wore away through my groaning all the day long. 
 4  For day and night Thy hand was heavy upon me; my sap was turned as in the droughts of summer. Selah 
 5  I acknowledged my sin unto Thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid; I said: 'I will make confession concerning my transgressions unto the LORD' --and Thou, Thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah 
 6  For this let every one that is godly pray unto Thee in a time when Thou mayest be found; surely, when the great waters overflow, they will not reach unto him. 
 7 ¶ Thou art my hiding-place; Thou wilt preserve me from the adversary; with songs of deliverance Thou wilt compass me about. Selah 
 8  'I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go; I will give counsel, Mine eye being upon thee.' 
 9  Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding; whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, that they come not near unto thee. 
 10  Many are the sorrows of the wicked; but he that trusteth in the LORD, mercy compasseth him about. 
 11  Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, ye righteous; and shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart.
