 1 ¶ The LORD reigneth; He is clothed in majesty; the LORD is clothed, He hath girded Himself with strength; yea, the world is established, that it cannot be moved. 
 2  Thy throne is established of old; Thou art from everlasting. 
 3  The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their roaring. 
 4  Above the voices of many waters, the mighty breakers of the sea, the LORD on high is mighty. 
 5  Thy testimonies are very sure, holiness becometh Thy house, O LORD, for evermore.
