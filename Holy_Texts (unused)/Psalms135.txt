 1 ¶ Hallelujah. Praise ye the name of the LORD; give praise, O ye servants of the LORD, 
 2  Ye that stand in the house of the LORD, in the courts of the house of our God. 
 3  Praise ye the LORD, for the LORD is good; sing praises unto His name, for it is pleasant. 
 4  For the LORD hath chosen Jacob unto Himself, and Israel for His own treasure. 
 5 ¶ For I know that the LORD is great, and that our Lord is above all gods. 
 6  Whatsoever the LORD pleased, that hath He done, in heaven and in earth, in the seas and in all deeps; 
 7  Who causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; He maketh lightnings for the rain; He bringeth forth the wind out of His treasuries. 
 8  Who smote the first-born of Egypt, both of man and beast. 
 9  He sent signs and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants. 
 10  Who smote many nations, and slew mighty kings: 
 11  Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan; 
 12  And gave their land for a heritage, a heritage unto Israel His people. 
 13  O LORD, Thy name endureth for ever; thy memorial, O LORD, throughout all generations. 
 14  For the LORD will judge His people, and repent Himself for His servants. 
 15 ¶ The idols of the nations are silver and gold, the work of men's hands. 
 16  They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see not; 
 17  They have ears, but they hear not; neither is there any breath in their mouths. 
 18  They that make them shall be like unto them; yea, every one that trusteth in them. 
 19  O house of Israel, bless ye the LORD; O house of Aaron, bless ye the LORD; 
 20  O house of Levi, bless ye the LORD; ye that fear the LORD, bless ye the LORD. 
 21  Blessed be the LORD out of Zion, who dwelleth at Jerusalem. Hallelujah.
