 1 ¶ (13:1) For the Leader. A Psalm of David. (13:2) How long, O LORD, wilt Thou forget me for ever? How long wilt Thou hide Thy face from me? 
 2  (13:3) How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my heart by day? How long shall mine enemy be exalted over me? 
 3  (13:4) Behold Thou, and answer me, O LORD my God; lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death; 
 4  (13:5) Lest mine enemy say: 'I have prevailed against him'; lest mine adversaries rejoice when I am moved. 
 5  (13:6) But as for me, in Thy mercy do I trust; my heart shall rejoice in Thy salvation. 
 6  (13:6) I will sing unto the LORD, because He hath dealt bountifully with me.
