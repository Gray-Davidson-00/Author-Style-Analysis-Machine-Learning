 1 ¶ A Psalm of David. LORD, I have called Thee; make haste unto me; give ear unto my voice, when I call unto Thee. 
 2  Let my prayer be set forth as incense before Thee, the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice. 
 3  Set a guard, O LORD, to my mouth; keep watch at the door of my lips. 
 4  Incline not my heart to any evil thing, to be occupied in deeds of wickedness with men that work iniquity; and let me not eat of their dainties. 
 5 ¶ Let the righteous smite me in kindness, and correct me; oil so choice let not my head refuse; for still is my prayer because of their wickedness. 
 6  Their judges are thrown down by the sides of the rock; and they shall hear my words, that they are sweet. 
 7  As when one cleaveth and breaketh up the earth, our bones are scattered at the grave's mouth. 
 8  For mine eyes are unto Thee, O GOD the Lord; in Thee have I taken refuge, O pour not out my soul. 
 9  Keep me from the snare which they have laid for me, and from the gins of the workers of iniquity. 
 10  Let the wicked fall into their own nets, whilst I withal escape.
