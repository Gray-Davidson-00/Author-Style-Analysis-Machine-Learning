 1 ¶ (6:1) For the Leader; with string-music; on the Sheminith. A Psalm of David. (6:2) O LORD, rebuke me not in Thine anger, neither chasten me in Thy wrath. 
 2  (6:3) Be gracious unto me, O LORD, for I languish away; heal me, O LORD, for my bones are affrighted. 
 3  (6:4) My soul also is sore affrighted; and Thou, O LORD, how long? 
 4  (6:5) Return, O LORD, deliver my soul; save me for Thy mercy's sake. 
 5  (6:6) For in death there is no remembrance of Thee; in the nether-world who will give Thee thanks? 
 6  (6:7) I am weary with my groaning; every night make I my bed to swim; I melt away my couch with my tears. 
 7  (6:8) Mine eye is dimmed because of vexation; it waxeth old because of all mine adversaries. 
 8 ¶ (6:9) Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the LORD hath heard the voice of my weeping. 
 9  (6:10) The LORD hath heard my supplication; the LORD receiveth my prayer. 
 10  (6:11) All mine enemies shall be ashamed and sore affrighted; they shall turn back, they shall be ashamed suddenly.
