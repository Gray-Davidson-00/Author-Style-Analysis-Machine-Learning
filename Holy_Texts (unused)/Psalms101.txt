 1 ¶ A Psalm of David. I will sing of mercy and justice; unto Thee, O LORD, will I sing praises. 
 2  I will give heed unto the way of integrity; oh when wilt Thou come unto me? I will walk within my house in the integrity of my heart. 
 3  I will set no base thing before mine eyes; I hate the doing of things crooked; it shall not cleave unto me. 
 4  A perverse heart shall depart from me; I will know no evil thing. 
 5  Whoso slandereth his neighbour in secret, him will I destroy; whoso is haughty of eye and proud of heart, him will I not suffer. 
 6  Mine eyes are upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me; he that walketh in a way of integrity, he shall minister unto me. 
 7  He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house; he that speaketh falsehood shall not be established before mine eyes. 
 8  Morning by morning will I destroy all the wicked of the land; to cut off all the workers of iniquity from the city of the LORD.
