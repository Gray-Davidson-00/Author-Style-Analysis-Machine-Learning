 1 ¶ (102:1) A Prayer of the afflicted, when he fainteth, and poureth out his complaint before the LORD. (102:2) O LORD, hear my prayer, and let my cry come unto Thee. 
 2  (102:3) Hide not Thy face from me in the day of my distress; incline Thine ear unto me; in the day when I call answer me speedily. 
 3  (102:4) For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as a hearth. 
 4  (102:5) My heart is smitten like grass, and withered; for I forget to eat my bread. 
 5  (102:6) By reason of the voice of my sighing my bones cleave to my flesh. 
 6  (102:7) I am like a pelican of the wilderness; I am become as an owl of the waste places. 
 7  (102:8) I watch, and am become like a sparrow that is alone upon the housetop. 
 8  (102:9) Mine enemies taunt me all the day; they that are mad against me do curse by me. 
 9  (102:10) For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping, 
 10  (102:11) Because of Thine indignation and Thy wrath; for Thou hast taken me up, and cast me away. 
 11  (102:12) My days are like a lengthening shadow; and I am withered like grass. 
 12 ¶ (102:13) But Thou, O LORD, sittest enthroned for ever; and Thy name is unto all generations. 
 13  (102:14) Thou wilt arise, and have compassion upon Zion; for it is time to be gracious unto her, for the appointed time is come. 
 14  (102:15) For Thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and love her dust. 
 15  (102:16) So the nations will fear the name of the LORD, and all the kings of the earth Thy glory; 
 16  (102:17) When the LORD hath built up Zion, when He hath appeared in His glory; 
 17  (102:18) When He hath regarded the prayer of the destitute, and hath not despised their prayer. 
 18  (102:19) This shall be written for the generation to come; and a people which shall be created shall praise the LORD. 
 19  (102:20) For He hath looked down from the height of His sanctuary; from heaven did the LORD behold the earth; 
 20  (102:21) To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are appointed to death; 
 21  (102:22) That men may tell of the name of the LORD in Zion, and His praise in Jerusalem; 
 22  (102:23) When the peoples are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve the LORD. 
 23 ¶ (102:24) He weakened my strength in the way; He shortened my days. 
 24  (102:25) I say: 'O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days, Thou whose years endure throughout all generations. 
 25  (102:26) Of old Thou didst lay the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the work of Thy hands. 
 26  (102:27) They shall perish, but Thou shalt endure; yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt Thou change them, and they shall pass away; 
 27  (102:28) But Thou art the selfsame, and Thy years shall have no end. 
 28  (102:29) The children of Thy servants shall dwell securely, and their seed shall be established before Thee.'
