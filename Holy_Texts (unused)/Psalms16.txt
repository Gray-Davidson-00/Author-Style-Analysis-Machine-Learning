 1 ¶ Michtam of David. Keep me, O God; for I have taken refuge in Thee. 
 2  I have said unto the LORD: 'Thou art my Lord; I have no good but in Thee'; 
 3  As for the holy that are in the earth, they are the excellent in whom is all my delight. 
 4  Let the idols of them be multiplied that make suit unto another; their drink-offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take their names upon my lips. 
 5  O LORD, the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup, Thou maintainest my lot. 
 6  The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage. 
 7  I will bless the LORD, who hath given me counsel; yea, in the night seasons my reins instruct me. 
 8 ¶ I have set the LORD always before me; surely He is at my right hand, I shall not be moved. 
 9  Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth; my flesh also dwelleth in safety; 
 10  For Thou wilt not abandon my soul to the nether-world; neither wilt Thou suffer Thy godly one to see the pit. 
 11  Thou makest me to know the path of life; in Thy presence is fulness of joy, in Thy right hand bliss for evermore.
