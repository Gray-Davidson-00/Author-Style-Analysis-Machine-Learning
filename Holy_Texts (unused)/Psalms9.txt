 1 ¶ (9:1) For the Leader; upon Muthlabben. A Psalm of David. (9:2) I will give thanks unto the LORD with my whole heart; I will tell of all Thy marvellous works. 
 2  (9:3) I will be glad and exult in Thee; I will sing praise to Thy name, O Most High: 
 3  (9:4) When mine enemies are turned back, they stumble and perish at Thy presence; 
 4  (9:5) For Thou hast maintained my right and my cause; Thou sattest upon the throne as the righteous Judge. 
 5  (9:6) Thou hast rebuked the nations, Thou hast destroyed the wicked, Thou hast blotted out their name for ever and ever. 
 6  (9:7) O thou enemy, the waste places are come to an end for ever; and the cities which thou didst uproot, their very memorial is perished. 
 7  (9:8) But the LORD is enthroned for ever; He hath established His throne for judgment. 
 8  (9:9) And He will judge the world in righteousness, He will minister judgment to the peoples with equity. 
 9  (9:10) The LORD also will be a high tower for the oppressed, a high tower in times of trouble; 
 10  (9:11) And they that know Thy name will put their trust in Thee; for thou, LORD, hast not forsaken them that seek Thee. 
 11 ¶ (9:12) Sing praises to the LORD, who dwelleth in Zion; declare among the peoples His doings. 
 12  (9:13) For He that avengeth blood hath remembered them; He hath not forgotten the cry of the humble. 
 13  (9:14) Be gracious unto me, O LORD, behold mine affliction at the hands of them that hate me; Thou that liftest me up from the gates of death; 
 14  (9:15) That I may tell of all Thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion, that I may rejoice in Thy salvation. 
 15  (9:16) The nations are sunk down in the pit that they made; in the net which they hid is their own foot taken. 
 16  (9:17) The LORD hath made Himself known, He hath executed judgment, the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah 
 17  (9:18) The wicked shall return to the nether-world, even all the nations that forget God. 
 18  (9:19) For the needy shall not alway be forgotten, nor the expectation of the poor perish for ever. 
 19  (9:20) Arise, O LORD, let not man prevail; let the nations be judged in Thy sight. 
 20  (9:21) Set terror over them, O LORD; let the nations know they are but men. Selah
