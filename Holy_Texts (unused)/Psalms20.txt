 1 ¶ (20:1) For the Leader. A Psalm of David. (20:2) The LORD answer thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God of Jacob set thee up on high; 
 2  (20:3) Send forth thy help from the sanctuary, and support thee out of Zion; 
 3  (20:4) Receive the memorial of all thy meal-offerings, and accept the fat of thy burnt-sacrifice; Selah 
 4  (20:5) Grant thee according to thine own heart, and fulfil all thy counsel. 
 5  (20:6) We will shout for joy in thy victory, and in the name of our God we will set up our standards; the LORD fulfil all thy petitions. 
 6 ¶ (20:7) Now know I that the LORD saveth His anointed; He will answer him from His holy heaven with the mighty acts of His saving right hand. 
 7  (20:8) Some trust in chariots, and some in horses; but we will make mention of the name of the LORD our God. 
 8  (20:9) They are bowed down and fallen; but we are risen, and stand upright. 
 9  (20:10) Save, LORD; let the King answer us in the day that we call.
