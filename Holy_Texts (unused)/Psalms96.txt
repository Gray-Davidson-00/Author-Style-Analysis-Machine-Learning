 1 ¶ O sing unto the LORD a new song; sing unto the LORD, all the earth. 
 2  Sing unto the LORD, bless His name; proclaim His salvation from day to day. 
 3  Declare His glory among the nations, His marvellous works among all the peoples. 
 4  For great is the LORD, and highly to be praised; He is to be feared above all gods. 
 5  For all the gods of the peoples are things of nought; but the LORD made the heavens. 
 6  Honour and majesty are before Him; strength and beauty are in His sanctuary. 
 7  Ascribe unto the LORD, ye kindreds of the peoples, ascribe unto the LORD glory and strength. 
 8  Ascribe unto the LORD the glory due unto His name; bring an offering, and come into His courts. 
 9  O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness; tremble before Him, all the earth. 
 10 ¶ Say among the nations: 'The LORD reigneth.' The world also is established that it cannot be moved; He will judge the peoples with equity. 
 11  Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice; let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; 
 12  Let the field exult; and all that is therein; then shall all the trees of the wood sing for joy; 
 13  Before the LORD, for He is come; for He is come to judge the earth; He will judge the world with righteousness, and the peoples in His faithfulness.
