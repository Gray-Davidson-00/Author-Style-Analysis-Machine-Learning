 1 ¶ (12:1) For the Leader; on the Sheminith. A Psalm of David. (12:2) Help, LORD; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from among the children of men. 
 2  (12:3) They speak falsehood every one with his neighbour; with flattering lip, and with a double heart, do they speak. 
 3  (12:4) May the LORD cut off all flattering lips, the tongue that speaketh proud things! 
 4  (12:5) Who have said: 'Our tongue will we make mighty; our lips are with us: who is lord over us?' 
 5  (12:6) 'For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I arise', saith the LORD; 'I will set him in safety at whom they puff.' 
 6  (12:7) The words of the LORD are pure words, as silver tried in a crucible on the earth, refined seven times. 
 7  (12:8) Thou wilt keep them, O LORD; Thou wilt preserve us from this generation for ever. 
 8  (12:9) The wicked walk on every side, when vileness is exalted among the sons of men.
