 1 ¶ (142:1) Maschil of David, when he was in the cave; a Prayer. (142:2) With my voice I cry unto the LORD; with my voice I make supplication unto the LORD. 
 2  (142:3) I pour out my complaint before Him, I declare before Him my trouble; 
 3  (142:4) When my spirit fainteth within me--Thou knowest my path--in the way wherein I walk have they hidden a snare for me. 
 4 ¶ (142:5) Look on my right hand, and see, for there is no man that knoweth me; I have no way to flee; no man careth for my soul. 
 5  (142:6) I have cried unto Thee, O LORD; I have said: 'Thou art my refuge, my portion in the land of the living.' 
 6  (142:7) Attend unto my cry; for I am brought very low; deliver me from my persecutors; for they are too strong for me. 
 7  (142:8) Bring my soul out of prison, that I may give thanks unto Thy name; the righteous shall crown themselves because of me; for Thou wilt deal bountifully with me.
