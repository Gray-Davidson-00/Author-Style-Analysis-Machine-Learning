 1 ¶ (49:1) For the Leader; a Psalm of the sons of Korah. (49:2) Hear this, all ye peoples; give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world, 
 2  (49:3) Both low and high, rich and poor together. 
 3  (49:4) My mouth shall speak wisdom, and the meditation of my heart shall be understanding. 
 4  (49:5) I will incline mine ear to a parable; I will open my dark saying upon the harp. 
 5  (49:6) Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity of my supplanters compasseth me about, 
 6 ¶ (49:7) Of them that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches? 
 7  (49:8) No man can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him-- 
 8  (49:9) For too costly is the redemption of their soul, and must be let alone for ever-- 
 9  (49:10) That he should still live alway, that he should not see the pit. 
 10  (49:11) For he seeth that wise men die, the fool and the brutish together perish, and leave their wealth to others. 
 11  (49:12) Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever, and their dwelling-places to all generations; they call their lands after their own names. 
 12  (49:13) But man abideth not in honour; he is like the beasts that perish. 
 13  (49:14) This is the way of them that are foolish, and of those who after them approve their sayings. Selah 
 14  (49:15) Like sheep they are appointed for the nether-world; death shall be their shepherd; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their form shall be for the nether-world to wear away, that there be no habitation for it. 
 15 ¶ (49:16) But God will redeem my soul from the power of the nether-world; for He shall receive me. Selah 
 16  (49:17) Be not thou afraid when one waxeth rich, when the wealth of his house is increased; 
 17  (49:18) For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away; his wealth shall not descend after him. 
 18  (49:19) Though while he lived he blessed his soul: 'Men will praise thee, when thou shalt do well to thyself'; 
 19  (49:20) It shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see the light. 
 20  (49:21) Man that is in honour understandeth not; he is like the beasts that perish.
