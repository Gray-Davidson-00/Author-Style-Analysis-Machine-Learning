 1 ¶ (46:1) For the Leader; a Psalm of the sons of Korah; upon Alamoth. A Song. (46:2) God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. 
 2  (46:3) Therefore will we not fear, though the earth do change, and though the mountains be moved into the heart of the seas; 
 3  (46:4) Though the waters thereof roar and foam, though the mountains shake at the swelling thereof. Selah 
 4  (46:5) There is a river, the streams whereof make glad the city of God, the holiest dwelling-place of the Most High. 
 5  (46:6) God is in the midst of her, she shall not be moved; God shall help her, at the approach of morning. 
 6 ¶ (46:7) Nations were in tumult, kingdoms were moved; He uttered His voice, the earth melted. 
 7  (46:8) The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our high tower. Selah 
 8  (46:9) Come, behold the works of the LORD, who hath made desolations in the earth. 
 9  (46:10) He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; He breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; He burneth the chariots in the fire. 
 10  (46:11) 'Let be, and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth.' 
 11  (46:12) The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our high tower. Selah
