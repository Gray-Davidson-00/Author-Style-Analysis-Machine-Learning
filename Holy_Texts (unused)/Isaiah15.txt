 1 ¶ The burden of Moab. For in the night that Ar of Moab is laid waste, he is brought to ruin; for in the night that Kir of Moab is laid waste, he is brought to ruin. 
 2  He is gone up to Baith, and to Dibon, to the high places, to weep; upon Nebo, and upon Medeba, Moab howleth; on all their heads is baldness, every beard is shaven. 
 3  In their streets they gird themselves with sackcloth; on their housetops, and in their broad places, every one howleth, weeping profusely. 
 4  And Heshbon crieth out, and Elealeh; their voice is heard even unto Jahaz; therefore the armed men of Moab cry aloud; his soul is faint within him. 
 5  My heart crieth out for Moab; her fugitives reach unto Zoar, a heifer of three years old; for by the ascent of Luhith with weeping they go up; for in the way of Horonaim they raise up a cry of destruction. 
 6 ¶ For the Waters of Nimrim shall be desolate; for the grass is withered away, the herbage faileth, there is no green thing. 
 7  Therefore the abundance they have gotten, and that which they have laid up, shall they carry away to the brook of the willows. 
 8  For the cry is gone round about the borders of Moab; the howling thereof unto Eglaim, and the howling thereof unto Beer-elim. 
 9  For the waters of Dimon are full of blood; for I will bring yet more upon Dimon, a lion upon him that escapeth of Moab, and upon the remnant of the land.
