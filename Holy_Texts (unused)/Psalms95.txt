 1 ¶ O come, let us sing unto the LORD; let us shout for joy to the Rock of our salvation. 
 2  Let us come before His presence with thanksgiving, let us shout for joy unto Him with psalms. 
 3  For the LORD is a great God, and a great King above all gods; 
 4  In whose hand are the depths of the earth; the heights of the mountains are His also. 
 5  The sea is His, and He made it; and His hands formed the dry land. 
 6  O come, let us bow down and bend the knee; let us kneel before the LORD our Maker; 
 7 ¶ For He is our God, and we are the people of His pasture, and the flock of His hand. To-day, if ye would but hearken to His voice! 
 8  'Harden not your heart, as at Meribah, as in the day of Massah in the wilderness; 
 9  When your fathers tried Me, proved Me, even though they saw My work. 
 10  For forty years was I wearied with that generation, and said: It is a people that do err in their heart, and they have not known My ways; 
 11  Wherefore I swore in My wrath, that they should not enter into My rest.'
