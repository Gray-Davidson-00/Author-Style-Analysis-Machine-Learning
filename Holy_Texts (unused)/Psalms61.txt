 1 ¶ (61:1) For the Leader; with string-music. A Psalm of David. (61:2) Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer. 
 2  (61:3) From the end of the earth will I call unto Thee, when my heart fainteth; lead me to a rock that is too high for me. 
 3  (61:4) For Thou hast been a refuge for me, a tower of strength in the face of the enemy. 
 4  (61:5) I will dwell in Thy Tent for ever; I will take refuge in the covert of Thy wings. Selah 
 5 ¶ (61:6) For Thou, O God, hast heard my vows; Thou hast granted the heritage of those that fear Thy name. 
 6  (61:7) Mayest Thou add days unto the king's days! May his years be as many generations! 
 7  (61:8) May he be enthroned before God for ever! Appoint mercy and truth, that they may preserve him. 
 8  (61:9) So will I sing praise unto Thy name for ever, that I may daily perform my vows.
