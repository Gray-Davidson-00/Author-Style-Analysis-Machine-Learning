 1 ¶ (14:2) Return, O Israel, unto the LORD thy God; for thou hast stumbled in thine iniquity. 
 2  (14:3) Take with you words, and return unto the LORD; say unto Him: 'Forgive all iniquity, and accept that which is good; so will we render for bullocks the offering of our lips. 
 3  (14:4) Asshur shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses; neither will we call any more the work of our hands our gods; for in Thee the fatherless findeth mercy.' 
 4 ¶ (14:5) I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely; for Mine anger is turned away from him. 
 5  (14:6) I will be as the dew unto Israel; he shall blossom as the lily, and cast forth his roots as Lebanon. 
 6  (14:7) His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the olive-tree, and his fragrance as Lebanon. 
 7  (14:8) They that dwell under his shadow shall again make corn to grow, and shall blossom as the vine; the scent thereof shall be as the wine of Lebanon. 
 8 ¶ (14:9) Ephraim shall say: 'What have I to do any more with idols?' As for Me, I respond and look on him; I am like a leafy cypress-tree; from Me is thy fruit found. 
 9  (14:10) Whoso is wise, let him understand these things, whoso is prudent, let him know them. For the ways of the LORD are right, and the just do walk in them; but transgressors do stumble therein.
