 1 ¶ For the Leader. A Psalm of David. In the LORD have I taken refuge; how say ye to my soul: 'Flee thou! to your mountain, ye birds'? 
 2  For, lo, the wicked bend the bow, they have made ready their arrow upon the string, that they may shoot in darkness at the upright in heart. 
 3  When the foundations are destroyed, what hath the righteous wrought? 
 4 ¶ The LORD is in His holy temple, the LORD, His throne is in heaven; His eyes behold, His eyelids try, the children of men. 
 5  The LORD trieth the righteous; but the wicked and him that loveth violence His soul hateth. 
 6  Upon the wicked He will cause to rain coals; fire and brimstone and burning wind shall be the portion of their cup. 
 7  For the LORD is righteous, He loveth righteousness; the upright shall behold His face.
