 1 ¶ (39:1) For the Leader, for Jeduthun. A Psalm of David. (39:2) I said: 'I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue; I will keep a curb upon my mouth, while the wicked is before me.' 
 2  (39:3) I was dumb with silence; I held my peace, had no comfort; and my pain was held in check. 
 3  (39:4) My heart waxed hot within me; while I was musing, the fire kindled; then spoke I with my tongue: 
 4  (39:5) 'LORD, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days, what it is; let me know how short-lived I am. 
 5  (39:6) Behold, Thou hast made my days as hand-breadths; and mine age is as nothing before Thee; surely every man at his best estate is altogether vanity. Selah 
 6  (39:7) Surely man walketh as a mere semblance; surely for vanity they are in turmoil; he heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who shall gather them. 
 7 ¶ (39:8) And now, Lord, what wait I for? My hope, it is in Thee. 
 8  (39:9) Deliver me from all my transgressions; make me not the reproach of the base. 
 9  (39:10) I am dumb, I open not my mouth; because Thou hast done it. 
 10  (39:11) Remove Thy stroke from off me; I am consumed by the blow of Thy hand. 
 11  (39:12) With rebukes dost Thou chasten man for iniquity, and like a moth Thou makest his beauty to consume away; surely every man is vanity. Selah 
 12  (39:13) Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear unto my cry; keep not silence at my tears; for I am a stranger with Thee, a sojourner, as all my fathers were. 
 13  (39:14) Look away from me, that I may take comfort, before I go hence, and be no more.'
