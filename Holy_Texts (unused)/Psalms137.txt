 1 ¶ By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion. 
 2  Upon the willows in the midst thereof we hanged up our harps. 
 3  For there they that led us captive asked of us words of song, and our tormentors asked of us mirth: 'Sing us one of the songs of Zion.' 
 4  How shall we sing the LORD'S song in a foreign land? 
 5  If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning. 
 6  Let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth, if I remember thee not; if I set not Jerusalem above my chiefest joy. 
 7 ¶ Remember, O LORD, against the children of Edom the day of Jerusalem; who said: 'Rase it, rase it, even to the foundation thereof.' 
 8  O daughter of Babylon, that art to be destroyed; happy shall he be, that repayeth thee as thou hast served us. 
 9  Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the rock.
