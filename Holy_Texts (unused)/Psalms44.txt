 1 ¶ (44:1) For the Leader; a Psalm of the sons of Korah. Maschil. (44:2) O God, we have heard with our ears, our fathers have told us; a work Thou didst in their days, in the days of old. 
 2  (44:3) Thou with Thy hand didst drive out the nations, and didst plant them in; Thou didst break the peoples, and didst spread them abroad. 
 3  (44:4) For not by their own sword did they get the land in possession, neither did their own arm save them; but Thy right hand, and Thine arm, and the light of Thy countenance, because Thou wast favourable unto them. 
 4  (44:5) Thou art my King, O God; command the salvation of Jacob. 
 5  (44:6) Through Thee do we push down our adversaries; through Thy name do we tread them under that rise up against us. 
 6  (44:7) For I trust not in my bow, neither can my sword save me. 
 7  (44:8) But Thou hast saved us from our adversaries, and hast put them to shame that hate us. 
 8  (44:9) In God have we gloried all the day, and we will give thanks unto Thy name for ever. Selah 
 9 ¶ (44:10) Yet Thou hast cast off, and brought us to confusion; and goest not forth with our hosts. 
 10  (44:11) Thou makest us to turn back from the adversary; and they that hate us spoil at their will. 
 11  (44:12) Thou hast given us like sheep to be eaten; and hast scattered us among the nations. 
 12  (44:13) Thou sellest Thy people for small gain, and hast not set their prices high. 
 13  (44:14) Thou makest us a taunt to our neighbours, a scorn and a derision to them that are round about us. 
 14  (44:15) Thou makest us a byword among the nations, a shaking of the head among the peoples. 
 15  (44:16) All the day is my confusion before me, and the shame of my face hath covered me, 
 16  (44:17) For the voice of him that taunteth and blasphemeth; by reason of the enemy and the revengeful. 
 17 ¶ (44:18) All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten Thee, neither have we been false to Thy covenant. 
 18  (44:19) Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from Thy path; 
 19  (44:20) Though Thou hast crushed us into a place of jackals, and covered us with the shadow of death. 
 20  (44:21) If we had forgotten the name of our God, or spread forth our hands to a strange god; 
 21  (44:22) Would not God search this out? For He knoweth the secrets of the heart. 
 22  (44:23) Nay, but for Thy sake are we killed all the day; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. 
 23  (44:24) Awake, why sleepest Thou, O Lord? Arouse Thyself, cast not off for ever. 
 24  (44:25) Wherefore hidest Thou Thy face, and forgettest our affliction and our oppression? 
 25  (44:26) For our soul is bowed down to the dust; our belly cleaveth unto the earth. 
 26  (44:27) Arise for our help, and redeem us for Thy mercy's sake.
