 1 ¶ (57:1) For the Leader; Al-tashheth. A Psalm of David; Michtam; when he fled from Saul, in the cave. (57:2) Be gracious unto me, O God, be gracious unto me, for in Thee hath my soul taken refuge; yea, in the shadow of Thy wings will I take refuge, until calamities be overpast. 
 2  (57:3) I will cry unto God Most high; unto God that accomplisheth it for me. 
 3  (57:4) He will send from heaven, and save me, when he that would swallow me up taunteth; Selah; God shall send forth His mercy and His truth. 
 4  (57:5) My soul is among lions, I do lie down among them that are aflame; even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword. 
 5  (57:6) Be Thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; Thy glory be above all the earth. 
 6  (57:7) They have prepared a net for my steps, my soul is bowed down; they have digged a pit before me, they are fallen into the midst thereof themselves. Selah 
 7 ¶ (57:8) My heart is stedfast, O God, my heart is stedfast; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises. 
 8  (57:9) Awake, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp; I will awake the dawn. 
 9  (57:10) I will give thanks unto Thee, O Lord, among the peoples; I will sing praises unto Thee among the nations. 
 10  (57:11) For Thy mercy is great unto the heavens, and Thy truth unto the skies. 
 11  (57:12) Be Thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; Thy glory be above all the earth.
