 1 ¶ (2:5) And I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand. 
 2  (2:6) Then said I: 'Whither goest thou?' And he said unto me: 'To measure Jerusalem, to see what is the breadth thereof, and what is the length thereof.' 
 3  (2:7) And, behold, the angel that spoke with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him, 
 4  (2:8) and said unto him: 'Run, speak to this young man, saying: 'Jerusalem shall be inhabited without walls for the multitude of men and cattle therein. 
 5  (2:9) For I, saith the LORD, will be unto her a wall of fire round about, and I will be the glory in the midst of her. 
 6 ¶ (2:10) Ho, ho, flee then from the land of the north, saith the LORD; for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven, saith the LORD. 
 7  (2:11) Ho, Zion, escape, thou that dwellest with the daughter of Babylon.' 
 8  (2:12) For thus saith the LORD of hosts who sent me after glory unto the nations which spoiled you: 'Surely, he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye. 
 9  (2:13) For, behold, I will shake My hand over them, and they shall be a spoil to those that served them'; and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me. 
 10 ¶ (2:14) 'Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion; for, lo, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith the LORD. 
 11  (2:15) And many nations shall join themselves to the LORD in that day, and shall be My people, and I will dwell in the midst of thee'; and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto thee. 
 12  (2:16) And the LORD shall inherit Judah as His portion in the holy land, and shall choose Jerusalem again. 
 13  (2:17) Be silent, all flesh, before the LORD; for He is aroused out of His holy habitation.
