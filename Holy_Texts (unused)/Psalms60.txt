 1 ¶ (60:1) For the Leader; upon Shushan Eduth; Michtam of David, to teach; (60:2) when he strove with Aram-naharaim and with Aram-zobah, and Joab returned, and smote of Edom in the Valley of Salt twelve thousand. (60:3) O God, Thou hast cast us off, Thou hast broken us down; Thou hast been angry; O restore us. 
 2  (60:4) Thou hast made the land to shake, Thou hast cleft it; heal the breaches thereof; for it tottereth. 
 3  (60:5) Thou hast made Thy people to see hard things; Thou hast made us to drink the wine of staggering. 
 4  (60:6) Thou hast given a banner to them that fear Thee, that it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah 
 5  (60:7) That Thy beloved may be delivered, save with Thy right hand, and answer me. 
 6 ¶ (60:8) God spoke in His holiness, that I would exult; that I would divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth. 
 7  (60:9) Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the defence of my head; Judah is my sceptre. 
 8  (60:10) Moab is my washpot; upon Edom do I cast my shoe; Philistia, cry aloud because of me! 
 9  (60:11) Who will bring me into the fortified city? Who will lead me unto Edom? 
 10  (60:12) Hast not Thou, O God, cast us off? And Thou goest not forth, O God, with our hosts. 
 11  (60:13) Give us help against the adversary; for vain is the help of man. 
 12  (60:14) Through God we shall do valiantly; for He it is that will tread down our adversaries.
