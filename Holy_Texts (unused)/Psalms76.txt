 1 ¶ (76:1) For the Leader; with string-music. A Psalm of Asaph, a Song. (76:2) In Judah is God known; His name is great in Israel. 
 2  (76:3) In Salem also is set His tabernacle, and His dwelling-place in Zion. 
 3  (76:4) There He broke the fiery shafts of the bow; the shield, and the sword, and the battle. Selah 
 4  (76:5) Glorious art Thou and excellent, coming down from the mountains of prey. 
 5  (76:6) The stout-hearted are bereft of sense, they sleep their sleep; and none of the men of might have found their hands. 
 6  (76:7) At Thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, they are cast into a dead sleep, the riders also and the horses. 
 7 ¶ (76:8) Thou, even Thou, art terrible; and who may stand in Thy sight when once Thou art angry? 
 8  (76:9) Thou didst cause sentence to be heard from heaven; the earth feared, and was still, 
 9  (76:10) When God arose to judgment, to save all the humble of the earth. Selah 
 10  (76:11) Surely the wrath of man shall praise Thee; the residue of wrath shalt Thou gird upon Thee. 
 11  (76:12) Vow, and pay unto the LORD your God; let all that are round about Him bring presents unto Him that is to be feared; 
 12  (76:13) He minisheth the spirit of princes; He is terrible to the kings of the earth.
