 1 ¶ (17:16) And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: 
 2  (17:17) 'Speak unto the children of Israel, and take of them rods, one for each fathers' house, of all their princes according to their fathers' houses, twelve rods; thou shalt write every man's name upon his rod. 
 3  (17:18) And thou shalt write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi, for there shall be one rod for the head of their fathers' houses. 
 4  (17:19) And thou shalt lay them up in the tent of meeting before the testimony, where I meet with you. 
 5  (17:20) And it shall come to pass, that the man whom I shall choose, his rod shall bud; and I will make to cease from Me the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against you.' 
 6  (17:21) And Moses spoke unto the children of Israel; and all their princes gave him rods, for each prince one, according to their fathers' houses, even twelve rods; and the rod of Aaron was among their rods. 
 7  (17:22) And Moses laid up the rods before the LORD in the tent of the testimony. 
 8 ¶ (17:23) And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses went into the tent of the testimony; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded, and put forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and bore ripe almonds. 
 9  (17:24) And Moses brought out all the rods from before the LORD unto all the children of Israel; and they looked, and took every man his rod. 
 10  (17:25) And the LORD said unto Moses: 'Put back the rod of Aaron before the testimony, to be kept there, for a token against the rebellious children; that there may be made an end of their murmurings against Me, that they die not.' 
 11  (17:26) Thus did Moses; as the LORD commanded him, so did he. 
 12  (17:27) And the children of Israel spoke unto Moses, saying: 'Behold, we perish, we are undone, we are all undone. 
 13  (17:28) Every one that cometh near, that cometh near unto the tabernacle of the LORD, is to die; shall we wholly perish?'
