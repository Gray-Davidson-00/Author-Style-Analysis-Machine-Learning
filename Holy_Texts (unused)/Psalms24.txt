 1 ¶ A Psalm of David. The earth is the LORD'S, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein. 
 2  For He hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the floods. 
 3 ¶ Who shall ascend into the mountain of the LORD? and who shall stand in His holy place? 
 4  He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not taken My name in vain, and hath not sworn deceitfully. 
 5  He shall receive a blessing from the LORD, and righteousness from the God of his salvation. 
 6  Such is the generation of them that seek after Him, that seek Thy face, even Jacob. Selah 
 7 ¶ Lift up your heads, O ye gates, and be ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors; that the King of glory may come in. 
 8  'Who is the King of glory?' 'The LORD strong and mighty, the LORD mighty in battle.' 
 9  Lift up your heads, O ye gates, yea, lift them up, ye everlasting doors; that the King of glory may come in. 
 10  'Who then is the King of glory?' 'The LORD of hosts; He is the King of glory.' Selah
