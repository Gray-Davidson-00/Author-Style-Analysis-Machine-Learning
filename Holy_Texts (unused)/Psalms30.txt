 1 ¶ (30:1) A Psalm; a Song at the Dedication of the House; of David. (30:2) I will extol thee, O LORD, for Thou hast raised me up, and hast not suffered mine enemies to rejoice over me. 
 2  (30:3) O LORD my God, I cried unto Thee, and Thou didst heal me; 
 3  (30:4) O LORD, Thou broughtest up my soul from the nether-world; Thou didst kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit. 
 4  (30:5) Sing praise unto the LORD, O ye His godly ones, and give thanks to His holy name. 
 5  (30:6) For His anger is but for a moment, His favour is for a life-time; weeping may tarry for the night, but joy cometh in the morning. 
 6 ¶ (30:7) Now I had said in my security: 'I shall never be moved.' 
 7  (30:8) Thou hadst established, O LORD, in Thy favour my mountain as a stronghold--Thou didst hide Thy face; I was affrighted. 
 8  (30:9) Unto Thee, O LORD, did I call, and unto the LORD I made supplication: 
 9  (30:10) 'What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit? Shall the dust praise Thee? shall it declare Thy truth? 
 10  (30:11) Hear, O LORD, and be gracious unto me; LORD, be Thou my helper.' 
 11  (30:12) Thou didst turn for me my mourning into dancing; Thou didst loose my sackcloth, and gird me with gladness; 
 12  (30:13) So that my glory may sing praise to Thee, and not be silent; O LORD my God, I will give thanks unto Thee for ever.
