 1 ¶ (47:1) For the Leader; a Psalm for the sons of Korah. (47:2) O clap your hands, all ye peoples; shout unto God with the voice of triumph. 
 2  (47:3) For the LORD is most high, awful; a great King over all the earth. 
 3  (47:4) He subdueth peoples under us, and nations under our feet. 
 4  (47:5) He chooseth our inheritance for us, the pride of Jacob whom He loveth. Selah 
 5 ¶ (47:6) God is gone up amidst shouting, the LORD amidst the sound of the horn. 
 6  (47:7) Sing praises to God, sing praises; sing praises unto our King, sing praises. 
 7  (47:8) For God is the King of all the earth; sing ye praises in a skilful song. 
 8  (47:9) God reigneth over the nations; God sitteth upon His holy throne. 
 9  (47:10) The princes of the peoples are gathered together, the people of the God of Abraham; for unto God belong the shields of the earth; He is greatly exalted.
