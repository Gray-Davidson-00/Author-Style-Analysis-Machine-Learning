 1 ¶ When Israel came forth out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language; 
 2  Judah became His sanctuary, Israel His dominion. 
 3  The sea saw it, and fled; the Jordan turned backward. 
 4  The mountains skipped like rams, the hills like young sheep. 
 5  What aileth thee, O thou sea, that thou fleest? thou Jordan, that thou turnest backward? 
 6  Ye mountains, that ye skip like rams; ye hills, like young sheep? 
 7  Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob; 
 8  Who turned the rock into a pool of water, the flint into a fountain of waters.
