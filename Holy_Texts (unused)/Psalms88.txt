 1 ¶ (88:1) A Song, a Psalm of the sons of Korah; for the Leader; upon Mahalath Leannoth. Maschil of Heman the Ezrahite. (88:2) O LORD, God of my salvation, what time I cry in the night before Thee, 
 2  (88:3) Let my prayer come before Thee, incline Thine ear unto my cry. 
 3  (88:4) For my soul is sated with troubles, and my life draweth nigh unto the grave. 
 4  (88:5) I am counted with them that go down into the pit; I am become as a man that hath no help; 
 5  (88:6) Set apart among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, whom Thou rememberest no more; and they are cut off from Thy hand. 
 6  (88:7) Thou hast laid me in the nether-most pit, in dark places, in the deeps. 
 7  (88:8) Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and all Thy waves Thou pressest down. Selah 
 8  (88:9) Thou hast put mine acquaintance far from me; Thou hast made me an abomination unto them; I am shut up, and I cannot come forth. 
 9  (88:10) Mine eye languisheth by reason of affliction; I have called upon Thee, O LORD, every day, I have spread forth my hands unto Thee. 
 10 ¶ (88:11) Wilt Thou work wonders for the dead? Or shall the shades arise and give Thee thanks? Selah 
 11  (88:12) Shall Thy mercy be declared in the grave? or Thy faithfulness in destruction? 
 12  (88:13) Shall Thy wonders be known in the dark? and Thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness? 
 13  (88:14) But as for me, unto Thee, O LORD, do I cry, and in the morning doth my prayer come to meet Thee. 
 14  (88:15) LORD, why castest Thou off my soul? Why hidest Thou Thy face from me? 
 15  (88:16) I am afflicted and at the point of death from my youth up; I have borne Thy terrors, I am distracted. 
 16  (88:17) Thy fierce wrath is gone over me; Thy terrors have cut me off. 
 17  (88:18) They came round about me like water all the day; they compassed me about together. 
 18  (88:19) Friend and companion hast Thou put far from me, and mine acquaintance into darkness.
