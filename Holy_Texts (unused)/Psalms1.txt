 1 ¶ HAPPY IS the man that hath not walked in the counsel of the wicked, nor stood in the way of sinners, nor sat in the seat of the scornful. 
 2  But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in His law doth he meditate day and night. 
 3  And he shall be like a tree planted by streams of water, that bringeth forth its fruit in its season, and whose leaf doth not wither; and in whatsoever he doeth he shall prosper. 
 4 ¶ Not so the wicked; but they are like the chaff which the wind driveth away. 
 5  Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous. 
 6  For the LORD regardeth the way of the righteous; but the way of the wicked shall perish.
