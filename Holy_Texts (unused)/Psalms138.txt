 1 ¶ A Psalm of David. I will give Thee thanks with my whole heart, in the presence of the mighty will I sing praises unto Thee. 
 2  I will bow down toward Thy holy temple, and give thanks unto Thy name for Thy mercy and for Thy truth; for Thou hast magnified Thy word above all Thy name. 
 3  In the day that I called, Thou didst answer me; Thou didst encourage me in my soul with strength. 
 4  All the kings of the earth shall give Thee thanks, O LORD, for they have heard the words of Thy mouth. 
 5  Yea, they shall sing of the ways of the LORD; for great is the glory of the LORD. 
 6 ¶ For though the LORD be high, yet regardeth He the lowly, and the haughty He knoweth from afar. 
 7  Though I walk in the midst of trouble, Thou quickenest me; Thou stretchest forth Thy hand against the wrath of mine enemies, and Thy right hand doth save me. 
 8  The LORD will accomplish that which concerneth me; Thy mercy, O LORD, endureth for ever; forsake not the work of Thine own hands.
