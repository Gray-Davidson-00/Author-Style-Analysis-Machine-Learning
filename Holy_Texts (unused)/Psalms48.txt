 1 ¶ (48:1) A Song; a Psalm of the sons of Korah. (48:2) Great is the LORD, and highly to be praised, in the city of our God, His holy mountain, 
 2  (48:3) Fair in situation, the joy of the whole earth; even mount Zion, the uttermost parts of the north, the city of the great King. 
 3  (48:4) God in her palaces hath made Himself known for a stronghold. 
 4  (48:5) For, lo, the kings assembled themselves, they came onward together. 
 5  (48:6) They saw, straightway they were amazed; they were affrighted, they hasted away. 
 6  (48:7) Trembling took hold of them there, pangs, as of a woman in travail. 
 7  (48:8) With the east wind Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish. 
 8 ¶ (48:9) As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD of hosts, in the city of our God--God establish it for ever. Selah 
 9  (48:10) We have thought on Thy lovingkindness, O God, in the midst of Thy temple. 
 10  (48:11) As is Thy name, O God, so is Thy praise unto the ends of the earth; Thy right hand is full of righteousness. 
 11  (48:12) Let mount Zion be glad, let the daughters of Judah rejoice, because of Thy judgments. 
 12  (48:13) Walk about Zion, and go round about her; count the towers thereof. 
 13  (48:14) Mark ye well her ramparts, traverse her palaces; that ye may tell it to the generation following. 
 14  (48:15) For such is God, our God, for ever and ever; He will guide us eternally.
