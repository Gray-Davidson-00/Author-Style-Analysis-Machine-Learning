 1 ¶ (56:1) For the Leader; upon Jonath-elem-rehokim. A Psalm of David; Michtam; when the Philistines took him in Gath. (56:2) Be gracious unto me, O God, for man would swallow me up; all the day he fighting oppresseth me. 
 2  (56:3) They that lie in wait for me would swallow me up all the day; for they are many that fight against me, O Most High, 
 3  (56:4) In the day that I am afraid, I will put my trust in Thee. 
 4  (56:5) In God--I will praise His word--in God do I trust, I will not be afraid; what can flesh do unto me? 
 5  (56:6) All the day they trouble mine affairs; all their thoughts are against me for evil. 
 6  (56:7) They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they mark my steps; according as they have waited for my soul. 
 7  (56:8) Because of iniquity cast them out; in anger bring down the peoples, O God. 
 8 ¶ (56:9) Thou has counted my wanderings; put Thou my tears into Thy bottle; are they not in Thy book? 
 9  (56:10) Then shall mine enemies turn back in the day that I call; this I know, that God is for me. 
 10  (56:11) In God--I will praise His word--in the LORD--I will praise His word-- 
 11  (56:12) In God do I trust, I will not be afraid; what can man do unto me? 
 12  (56:13) Thy vows are upon me, O God; I will render thank-offerings unto Thee. 
 13  (56:14) For thou hast delivered my soul from death; hast Thou not delivered my feet from stumbling? that I may walk before God in the light of the living?
