 1 ¶ (85:5) For the Leader. A Psalm of the sons of Korah. (85:2) LORD, Thou hast been favourable unto Thy land, Thou hast turned the captivity of Jacob. 
 2  (85:3) Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of Thy people, Thou hast pardoned all their sin. Selah 
 3  (85:4) Thou hast withdrawn all Thy wrath; Thou hast turned from the fierceness of Thine anger. 
 4  (85:5) Restore us, O God of our salvation, and cause Thine indignation toward us to cease. 
 5  (85:6) Wilt Thou be angry with us for ever? Wilt Thou draw out Thine anger to all generations? 
 6  (85:7) Wilt Thou not quicken us again, that Thy people may rejoice in Thee? 
 7  (85:8) Show us Thy mercy, O LORD, and grant us Thy salvation. 
 8 ¶ (85:9) I will hear what God the LORD will speak; for He will speak peace unto His people, and to His saints; but let them not turn back to folly. 
 9  (85:10) Surely His salvation is nigh them that fear Him; that glory may dwell in our land. 
 10  (85:11) Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other. 
 11  (85:12) Truth springeth out of the earth; and righteousness hath looked down from heaven. 
 12  (85:13) Yea, the LORD will give that which is good; and our land shall yield her produce. 
 13  (85:14) Righteousness shall go before Him, and shall make His footsteps a way.
