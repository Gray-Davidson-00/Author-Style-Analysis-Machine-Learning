 1 ¶ For the Leader. A Psalm of David. The fool hath said in his heart: 'There is no God'; they have dealt corruptly, they have done abominably; there is none that doeth good. 
 2  The LORD looked forth from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any man of understanding, that did seek after God. 
 3  They are all corrupt, they are together become impure; there is none that doeth good, no, not one. 
 4 ¶ 'Shall not all the workers of iniquity know it, who eat up My people as they eat bread, and call not upon the LORD?' 
 5  There are they in great fear; for God is with the righteous generation. 
 6  Ye would put to shame the counsel of the poor, but the LORD is his refuge. 
 7  Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When the LORD turneth the captivity of His people, let Jacob rejoice, let Israel be glad.
