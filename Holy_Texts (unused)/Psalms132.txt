 1 ¶ A Song of Ascents. LORD, remember unto David all his affliction; 
 2  How he swore unto the LORD, and vowed unto the Mighty One of Jacob: 
 3  'Surely I will not come into the tent of my house, nor go up into the bed that is spread for me; 
 4  I will not give sleep to mine eyes, nor slumber to mine eyelids; 
 5  Until I find out a place for the LORD, a dwelling-place for the Mighty One of Jacob.' 
 6  Lo, we heard of it as being in Ephrath; we found it in the field of the wood. 
 7  Let us go into His dwelling-place; let us worship at His footstool. 
 8  Arise, O LORD, unto Thy resting-place; Thou, and the ark of Thy strength. 
 9  Let Thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let Thy saints shout for joy. 
 10  For Thy servant David's sake turn not away the face of Thine anointed. 
 11 ¶ The LORD swore unto David in truth; He will not turn back from it: 'Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne. 
 12  If thy children keep My covenant and My testimony that I shall teach them, their children also for ever shall sit upon thy throne.' 
 13  For the LORD hath chosen Zion; He hath desired it for His habitation: 
 14  'This is My resting-place for ever; here will I dwell; for I have desired it. 
 15  I will abundantly bless her provision; I will give her needy bread in plenty. 
 16  Her priests also will I clothe with salvation; and her saints shall shout aloud for joy. 
 17  There will I make a horn to shoot up unto David, there have I ordered a lamp for Mine anointed. 
 18  His enemies will I clothe with shame; but upon himself shall his crown shine.'
