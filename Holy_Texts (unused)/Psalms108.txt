 1 ¶ (108:1) A Song, a Psalm of David. (108:2) My heart is steadfast, O God; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises, even with my glory. 
 2  (108:3) Awake, psaltery and harp; I will awake the dawn. 
 3  (108:4) I will give thanks unto Thee, O LORD, among the peoples; and I will sing praises unto Thee among the nations. 
 4  (108:5) For Thy mercy is great above the heavens, and Thy truth reacheth unto the skies. 
 5  (108:6) Be Thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; and Thy glory be above all the earth. 
 6 ¶ (108:7) That Thy beloved may be delivered, save with Thy right hand, and answer me. 
 7  (108:8) God spoke in His holiness, that I would exult; that I would divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth. 
 8  (108:9) Gilead is mine, Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the defence of my head; Judah is my sceptre. 
 9  (108:10) Moab is my washpot; upon Edom do I cast my shoe; over Philistia do I cry aloud. 
 10  (108:11) Who will bring me into the fortified city? Who will lead me unto Edom? 
 11  (108:12) Hast not Thou cast us off, O God? and Thou goest not forth, O God, with our hosts? 
 12  (108:13) Give us help against the adversary; for vain is the help of man. 
 13  (108:14) Through God we shall do valiantly; for He it is that will tread down our adversaries.
