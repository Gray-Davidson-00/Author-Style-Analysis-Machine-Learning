 1 ¶ (63:1) A Psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah. (63:2) O God, Thou art my God, earnestly will I seek Thee; my soul thirsteth for Thee, my flesh longeth for Thee, in a dry and weary land, where no water is. 
 2  (63:3) So have I looked for Thee in the sanctuary, to see Thy power and Thy glory. 
 3 ¶ (63:4) For Thy lovingkindness is better than life; my lips shall praise Thee. 
 4  (63:5) So will I bless Thee as long as I live; in Thy name will I lift up my hands. 
 5  (63:6) My soul is satisfied as with marrow and fatness; and my mouth doth praise Thee with joyful lips; 
 6  (63:7) When I remember Thee upon my couch, and meditate on Thee in the night-watches. 
 7 ¶ (63:8) For Thou hast been my help, and in the shadow of Thy wings do I rejoice. 
 8  (63:9) My soul cleaveth unto Thee; Thy right hand holdeth me fast. 
 9  (63:10) But those that seek my soul, to destroy it, shall go into the nethermost parts of the earth. 
 10  (63:11) They shall be hurled to the power of the sword; they shall be a portion for foxes. 
 11  (63:12) But the king shall rejoice in God; every one that sweareth by Him shall glory; for the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.
