 1 ¶ My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and lay up my commandments with thee; 
 2  So that thou make thine ear attend unto wisdom, and thy heart incline to discernment; 
 3  Yea, if thou call for understanding, and lift up thy voice for discernment; 
 4  If thou seek her as silver, and search for her as for hid treasures; 
 5  Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God. 
 6  For the LORD giveth wisdom, out of His mouth cometh knowledge and discernment; 
 7  He layeth up sound wisdom for the upright, He is a shield to them that walk in integrity; 
 8  That He may guard the paths of justice, and preserve the way of His godly ones. 
 9  Then shalt thou understand righteousness and justice, and equity, yea, every good path. 
 10 ¶ For wisdom shall enter into thy heart, and knowledge shall be pleasant unto thy soul; 
 11  Discretion shall watch over thee, discernment shall guard thee; 
 12  To deliver thee from the way of evil, from the men that speak froward things; 
 13  Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness; 
 14  Who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the frowardness of evil; 
 15  Who are crooked in their ways, and perverse in their paths; 
 16  To deliver thee from the strange woman, even from the alien woman that maketh smooth her words; 
 17  That forsaketh the lord of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God. 
 18  For her house sinketh down unto death, and her paths unto the shades; 
 19  None that go unto her return, neither do they attain unto the paths of life; 
 20  That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous. 
 21  For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the whole-hearted shall remain in it. 
 22  But the wicked shall be cut off from the land, and the faithless shall be plucked up out of it.
