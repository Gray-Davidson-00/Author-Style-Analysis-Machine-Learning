 1 ¶ When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and out of Egypt I called My son. 
 2  The more they called them, the more they went from them; they sacrificed unto the Baalim, and offered to graven images. 
 3  And I, I taught Ephraim to walk, taking them by their arms; but they knew not that I healed them. 
 4  I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love; and I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws, and I fed them gently. 
 5  He shall not return into the land of Egypt, but the Assyrian shall be his king, because they refused to return. 
 6  And the sword shall fall upon his cities, and shall consume his bars, and devour them, because of their own counsels. 
 7  And My people are in suspense about returning to Me; and though they call them upwards, none at all will lift himself up. 
 8 ¶ How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? How shall I surrender thee, Israel? How shall I make thee as Admah? How shall I set thee as Zeboim? My heart is turned within Me, My compassions are kindled together. 
 9  I will not execute the fierceness of Mine anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim; for I am God, and not man, the Holy One in the midst of thee; and I will not come in fury. 
 10  They shall walk after the LORD, who shall roar like a lion; for He shall roar, and the children shall come trembling from the west. 
 11  They shall come trembling as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assyria; and I will make them to dwell in their houses, saith the LORD. 
 12  (12:1) Ephraim compasseth Me about with lies, and the house of Israel with deceit; and Judah is yet wayward towards God, and towards the Holy One who is faithful.
