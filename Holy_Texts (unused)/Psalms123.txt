 1 ¶ A Song of Ascents. Unto Thee I lift up mine eyes, O Thou that art enthroned in the heavens. 
 2  Behold, as the eyes of servants unto the hand of their master, as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so our eyes look unto the LORD our God, until He be gracious unto us. 
 3  Be gracious unto us, O LORD, be gracious unto us; for we are full sated with contempt. 
 4  Our soul is full sated with the scorning of those that are at ease, and with the contempt of the proud oppressors.
