 1 ¶ (21:1) For the Leader. A Psalm of David. (21:2) O LORD, in Thy strength the king rejoiceth; and in Thy salvation how greatly doth he exult! 
 2  (21:3) Thou hast given him his heart's desire, and the request of his lips Thou hast not withholden. Selah 
 3  (21:4) For Thou meetest him with choicest blessings; Thou settest a crown of fine gold on his head. 
 4  (21:5) He asked life of Thee, Thou gavest it him; even length of days for ever and ever. 
 5  (21:6) His glory is great through Thy salvation; honour and majesty dost Thou lay upon him. 
 6  (21:7) For Thou makest him most blessed for ever; Thou makest him glad with joy in Thy presence. 
 7 ¶ (21:8) For the king trusteth in the LORD, yea, in the mercy of the Most High; he shall not be moved. 
 8  (21:9) Thy hand shall be equal to all thine enemies; thy right hand shall overtake those that hate thee. 
 9  (21:10) Thou shalt make them as a fiery furnace in the time of thine anger; the LORD shall swallow them up in His wrath, and the fire shall devour them. 
 10  (21:11) Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seed from among the children of men. 
 11  (21:12) For they intended evil against thee, they imagined a device, wherewith they shall not prevail. 
 12  (21:13) For thou shalt make them turn their back, thou shalt make ready with thy bowstrings against the face of them. 
 13  (21:14) Be Thou exalted, O LORD, in Thy strength; so will we sing and praise Thy power.
