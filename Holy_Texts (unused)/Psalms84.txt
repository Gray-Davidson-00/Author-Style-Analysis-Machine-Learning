 1 ¶ (84:1) For the Leader; upon the Gittith. A Psalm of the sons of Korah. (84:2) How lovely are Thy tabernacles, O LORD of hosts! 
 2  (84:3) My soul yearneth, yea, even pineth for the courts of the LORD; my heart and my flesh sing for joy unto the living God. 
 3  (84:4) Yea, the sparrow hath found a house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young; Thine altars, O LORD of hosts, my King, and my God--. 
 4  (84:5) Happy are they that dwell in Thy house, they are ever praising Thee. Selah 
 5  (84:6) Happy is the man whose strength is in Thee; in whose heart are the highways. 
 6  (84:7) Passing through the valley of Baca they make it a place of springs; yea, the early rain clotheth it with blessings. 
 7  (84:8) They go from strength to strength, every one of them appeareth before God in Zion. 
 8 ¶ (84:9) O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer; give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah 
 9  (84:10) Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of Thine anointed. 
 10  (84:11) For a day in Thy courts is better than a thousand; I had rather stand at the threshold of the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness. 
 11  (84:12) For the LORD God is a sun and a shield; the LORD giveth grace and glory; no good thing will He withhold from them that walk uprightly. 
 12  (84:13) O LORD of hosts, happy is the man that trusteth in Thee.
