 1 ¶ I love that the LORD should hear my voice and my supplications. 
 2  Because He hath inclined His ear unto me, therefore will I call upon Him all my days. 
 3  The cords of death compassed me, and the straits of the nether-world got hold upon me; I found trouble and sorrow. 
 4  But I called upon the name of the LORD: 'I beseech thee, O LORD, deliver my soul.' 
 5  Gracious is the LORD, and righteous; yea, our God is compassionate. 
 6  The LORD preserveth the simple; I was brought low, and He saved me. 
 7  Return, O my soul, unto Thy rest; for the LORD hath dealt bountifully with thee. 
 8  For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from stumbling. 
 9  I shall walk before the LORD in the lands of the living. 
 10 ¶ I trusted even when I spoke: 'I am greatly afflicted.' 
 11  I said in my haste: 'All men are liars.' 
 12  How can I repay unto the LORD all His bountiful dealings toward me? 
 13  I will lift up the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the LORD. 
 14  My vows will I pay unto the LORD, yea, in the presence of all His people. 
 15  Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of His saints. 
 16  I beseech Thee, O LORD, for I am Thy servant; I am Thy servant, the son of Thy handmaid; Thou hast loosed my bands. 
 17  I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call upon the name of the LORD. 
 18  I will pay my vows unto the LORD, yea, in the presence of all His people; 
 19  In the courts of the LORD'S house, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Hallelujah.
