 1 ¶ For the Leader. A Psalm of David; to make memorial. O God, to deliver me, O LORD, to help me, make haste. 
 2  Let them be ashamed and abashed that seek after my soul; let them be turned backward and brought to confusion that delight in my hurt. 
 3  Let them be turned back by reason of their shame that say: 'Aha, aha.' 
 4  Let all those that seek Thee rejoice and be glad in Thee; and let such as love Thy salvation say continually: 'Let God be magnified.' 
 5  But I am poor and needy; O God, make haste unto me; Thou art my help and my deliverer; O LORD, tarry not.
