 1 ¶ Hallelujah. Praise the LORD, O my soul. 
 2  I will praise the LORD while I live; I will sing praises unto my God while I have my being. 
 3  Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help. 
 4  His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his dust; in that very day his thoughts perish. 
 5 ¶ Happy is he whose help is the God of Jacob, whose hope is in the LORD his God, 
 6  Who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is; who keepeth truth for ever; 
 7  Who executeth justice for the oppressed; who giveth bread to the hungry. The LORD looseth the prisoners; 
 8  The LORD openeth the eyes of the blind; the LORD raiseth up them that are bowed down; the LORD loveth the righteous; 
 9  The LORD preserveth the strangers; He upholdeth the fatherless and the widow; but the way of the wicked He maketh crooked. 
 10  The LORD will reign for ever, Thy God, O Zion, unto all generations. Hallelujah.
