 1 ¶ (22:1) For the Leader; upon Aijeleth ha-Shahar. A Psalm of David. (22:2) My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me, and art far from my help at the words of my cry? 
 2  (22:3) O my God, I call by day, but Thou answerest not; and at night, and there is no surcease for me. 
 3  (22:4) Yet Thou art holy, O Thou that art enthroned upon the praises of Israel. 
 4  (22:5) In Thee did our fathers trust; they trusted, and Thou didst deliver them. 
 5  (22:6) Unto Thee they cried, and escaped; in Thee did they trust, and were not ashamed. 
 6  (22:7) But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people. 
 7  (22:8) All they that see me laugh me to scorn; they shoot out the lip, they shake the head: 
 8  (22:9) 'Let him commit himself unto the LORD! let Him rescue him; let Him deliver him, seeing He delighteth in him.' 
 9  (22:10) For Thou art He that took me out of the womb; Thou madest me trust when I was upon my mother's breasts. 
 10  (22:11) Upon Thee I have been cast from my birth; Thou art my God from my mother's womb. 
 11 ¶ (22:12) Be not far from me; for trouble is near; for there is none to help. 
 12  (22:13) Many bulls have encompassed me; strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round. 
 13  (22:14) They open wide their mouth against me, as a ravening and a roaring lion. 
 14  (22:15) I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint; my heart is become like wax; it is melted in mine inmost parts. 
 15  (22:16) My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaveth to my throat; and Thou layest me in the dust of death. 
 16  (22:17) For dogs have encompassed me; a company of evil-doers have inclosed me; like a lion, they are at my hands and my feet. 
 17  (22:18) I may count all my bones; they look and gloat over me. 
 18  (22:19) They part my garments among them, and for my vesture do they cast lots. 
 19  (22:20) But Thou, O LORD, be not far off; O Thou my strength, hasten to help me. 
 20  (22:21) Deliver my soul from the sword; mine only one from the power of the dog. 
 21  (22:22) Save me from the lion's mouth; yea, from the horns of the wild-oxen do Thou answer me. 
 22 ¶ (22:23) I will declare Thy name unto my brethren; in the midst of the congregation will I praise Thee. 
 23  (22:24) 'Ye that fear the LORD, praise Him; all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify Him; and stand in awe of Him, all ye the seed of Israel. 
 24  (22:25) For He hath not despised nor abhorred the lowliness of the poor; neither hath He hid His face from him; but when he cried unto Him, He heard.' 
 25  (22:26) From Thee cometh my praise in the great congregation; I will pay my vows before them that fear Him. 
 26  (22:27) Let the humble eat and be satisfied; let them praise the LORD that seek after Him; may your heart be quickened for ever! 
 27  (22:28) All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn unto the LORD; and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before Thee. 
 28  (22:29) For the kingdom is the LORD'S; and He is the ruler over the nations. 
 29  (22:30) All the fat ones of the earth shall eat and worship; all they that go down to the dust shall kneel before Him, even he that cannot keep his soul alive. 
 30  (22:31) A seed shall serve him; it shall be told of the Lord unto the next generation. 
 31  (22:32) They shall come and shall declare His righteousness unto a people that shall be born, that He hath done it.
