 1 ¶ Hallelujah. Praise, O ye servants of the LORD, praise the name of the LORD. 
 2  Blessed be the name of the LORD from this time forth and for ever. 
 3  From the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof the LORD'S name is to be praised. 
 4  The LORD is high above all nations, His glory is above the heavens. 
 5  Who is like unto the LORD our God, that is enthroned on high, 
 6  That looketh down low upon heaven and upon the earth? 
 7  Who raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the needy out of the dunghill; 
 8  That He may set him with princes, even with the princes of His people. 
 9  Who maketh the barren woman to dwell in her house as a joyful mother of children. Hallelujah.
