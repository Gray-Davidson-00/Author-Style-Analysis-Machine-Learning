 1 ¶ (40:1) For the Leader. A Psalm of David. (40:2) I waited patiently for the LORD; and He inclined unto me, and heard my cry. 
 2  (40:3) He brought me up also out of the tumultuous pit, out of the miry clay; and He set my feet upon a rock, He established my goings. 
 3  (40:4) And He hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God; many shall see, and fear, and shall trust in the LORD. 
 4  (40:5) Happy is the man that hath made the LORD his trust, and hath not turned unto the arrogant, nor unto such as fall away treacherously. 
 5  (40:6) Many things hast Thou done, O LORD my God, even Thy wonderful works, and Thy thoughts toward us; there is none to be compared unto Thee! If I would declare and speak of them, they are more than can be told. 
 6 ¶ (40:7) Sacrifice and meal-offering Thou hast no delight in; mine ears hast Thou opened; burnt-offering and sin-offering hast Thou not required. 
 7  (40:8) Then said I: 'Lo, I am come with the roll of a book which is prescribed for me; 
 8  (40:9) I delight to do Thy will, O my God; yea, Thy law is in my inmost parts.' 
 9  (40:10) I have preached righteousness in the great congregation, lo, I did not refrain my lips; O LORD, Thou knowest. 
 10  (40:11) I have not hid Thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared Thy faithfulness and Thy salvation; I have not concealed Thy mercy and Thy truth from the great congregation. 
 11 ¶ (40:12) Thou, O LORD, wilt not withhold Thy compassions from me; let Thy mercy and Thy truth continually preserve me. 
 12  (40:13) For innumerable evils have compassed me about, mine iniquities have overtaken me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the hairs of my head, and my heart hath failed me. 
 13  (40:14) Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me; O LORD, make haste to help me. 
 14  (40:15) Let them be ashamed and abashed together that seek after my soul to sweep it away; let them be turned backward and brought to confusion that delight in my hurt. 
 15  (40:16) Let them be appalled by reason of their shame that say unto me: 'Aha, aha.' 
 16  (40:17) Let all those that seek Thee rejoice and be glad in Thee; let such as love Thy salvation say continually: 'The LORD be magnified.' 
 17  (40:18) But, as for me, that am poor and needy, the Lord will account it unto me; Thou art my help and my deliverer; O my God, tarry not.
