 1 ¶ (42:1) For the Leader; Maschil of the sons of Korah. (42:2) As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after Thee, O God. 
 2  (42:3) My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: 'When shall I come and appear before God?' 
 3  (42:4) My tears have been my food day and night, while they say unto me all the day: 'Where is Thy God?' 
 4  (42:5) These things I remember, and pour out my soul within me, how I passed on with the throng, and led them to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, a multitude keeping holyday. 
 5  (42:6) Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why moanest thou within me? Hope thou in God; for I shall yet praise Him for the salvation of His countenance. 
 6 ¶ (42:7) O my God, my soul is cast down within me; therefore do I remember Thee from the land of Jordan, and the Hermons, from the hill Mizar. 
 7  (42:8) Deep calleth unto deep at the voice of Thy cataracts; all Thy waves and Thy billows are gone over me. 
 8  (42:9) By day the LORD will command His lovingkindness, and in the night His song shall be with me, even a prayer unto the God of my life. 
 9  (42:10) I will say unto God my Rock: 'Why hast Thou forgotten me? Why go I mourning under the oppression of the enemy?' 
 10  (42:11) As with a crushing in my bones, mine adversaries taunt me; while they say unto me all the day: 'Where is Thy God?' 
 11  (42:12) Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why moanest thou within me? Hope thou in God; for I shall yet praise Him, the salvation of my countenance, and my God.
