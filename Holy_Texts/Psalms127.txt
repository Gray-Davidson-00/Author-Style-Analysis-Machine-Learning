 1 ¶ A Song of Ascents; of Solomon. Except the LORD build the house, they labour in vain that build it; except the LORD keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain. 
 2  It is vain for you that ye rise early, and sit up late, ye that eat the bread of toil; so He giveth unto His beloved in sleep. 
 3  Lo, children are a heritage of the LORD; the fruit of the womb is a reward. 
 4  As arrows in the hand of a mighty man, so are the children of one's youth. 
 5  Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them; they shall not be put to shame, when they speak with their enemies in the gate.
