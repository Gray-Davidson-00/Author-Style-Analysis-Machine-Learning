 1 ¶ For the Leader. A Song, a Psalm. Shout unto God, all the earth; 
 2  Sing praises unto the glory of His name; make His praise glorious. 
 3  Say unto God: 'How tremendous is Thy work! Through the greatness of Thy power shall Thine enemies dwindle away before Thee. 
 4  All the earth shall worship Thee, and shall sing praises unto Thee; they shall sing praises to Thy name.' Selah 
 5  Come, and see the works of God; He is terrible in His doing toward the children of men. 
 6  He turned the sea into dry land; they went through the river on foot; there let us rejoice in Him! 
 7  Who ruleth by His might for ever; His eyes keep watch upon the nations; let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah 
 8 ¶ Bless our God, ye peoples, and make the voice of His praise to be heard; 
 9  Who hath set our soul in life, and suffered not our foot to be moved, 
 10  For Thou, O God, hast tried us; Thou hast refined us, as silver is refined. 
 11  Thou didst bring us into the hold; Thou didst lay constraint upon our loins. 
 12  Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads; we went through fire and through water; but Thou didst bring us out unto abundance. 
 13 ¶ I will come into Thy house with burnt-offerings, I will perform unto Thee my vows, 
 14  Which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I was in distress. 
 15  I will offer unto Thee burnt-offerings of fatlings, with the sweet smoke of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats. Selah 
 16  Come, and hearken, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what He hath done for my soul. 
 17  I cried unto Him with my mouth, and He was extolled with my tongue. 
 18  If I had regarded iniquity in my heart, the Lord would not hear; 
 19  But verily God hath heard; He hath attended to the voice of my prayer. 
 20  Blessed be God, who hath not turned away my prayer, nor His mercy from me.
