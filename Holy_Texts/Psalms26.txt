 1 ¶ A Psalm of David. Judge me, O LORD, for I have walked in mine integrity, and I have trusted in the LORD without wavering. 
 2  Examine me, O LORD, and try me; test my reins and my heart. 
 3  For Thy mercy is before mine eyes; and I have walked in Thy truth. 
 4  I have not sat with men of falsehood; neither will I go in with dissemblers. 
 5  I hate the gathering of evil doers, and will not sit with the wicked. 
 6 ¶ I will wash my hands in innocency; so will I compass Thine altar, O LORD, 
 7  That I may make the voice of thanksgiving to be heard, and tell of all Thy wondrous works. 
 8  LORD, I love the habitation of Thy house, and the place where Thy glory dwelleth. 
 9  Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with men of blood; 
 10  In whose hands is craftiness, and their right hand is full of bribes. 
 11  But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity; redeem me, and be gracious unto me. 
 12  My foot standeth in an even place; in the congregations will I bless the LORD.
