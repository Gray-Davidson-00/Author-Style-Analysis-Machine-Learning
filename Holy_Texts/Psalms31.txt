 1 ¶ (31:1) For the Leader. A Psalm of David. (31:2) In thee, O LORD, have I taken refuge; let me never be ashamed; deliver me in Thy righteousness. 
 2  (31:3) Incline Thine ear unto me, deliver me speedily; be Thou to me a rock of refuge, even a fortress of defence, to save me. 
 3  (31:4) For Thou art my rock and my fortress; therefore for Thy name's sake lead me and guide me. 
 4  (31:5) Bring me forth out of the net that they have hidden for me; for Thou art my stronghold. 
 5  (31:6) Into Thy hand I commit my spirit; Thou hast redeemed me, O LORD, Thou God of truth. 
 6  (31:7) I hate them that regard lying vanities; but I trust in the LORD. 
 7  (31:8) I will be glad and rejoice in Thy lovingkindness; for Thou hast seen mine affliction, Thou hast taken cognizance of the troubles of my soul, 
 8  (31:9) And Thou hast not given me over into the hand of the enemy; Thou hast set my feet in a broad place. 
 9 ¶ (31:10) Be gracious unto me, O LORD, for I am in distress; mine eye wasteth away with vexation, yea, my soul and my body. 
 10  (31:11) For my life is spent in sorrow, and my years in sighing; my strength faileth because of mine iniquity, and my bones are wasted away. 
 11  (31:12) Because of all mine adversaries I am become a reproach, yea, unto my neighbours exceedingly, and a dread to mine acquaintance; they that see me without flee from me. 
 12  (31:13) I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind; I am like a useless vessel. 
 13  (31:14) For I have heard the whispering of many, terror on every side; while they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my life. 
 14  (31:15) But as for me, I have trusted in Thee, O LORD; I have said: 'Thou art my God.' 
 15  (31:16) My times are in Thy hand; deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, and from them that persecute me. 
 16  (31:17) Make Thy face to shine upon Thy servant; save me in Thy lovingkindness. 
 17  (31:18) O LORD, let me not be ashamed, for I have called upon Thee; let the wicked be ashamed, let them be put to silence in the nether-world. 
 18  (31:19) Let the lying lips be dumb, which speak arrogantly against the righteous, with pride and contempt. 
 19 ¶ (31:20) Oh how abundant is Thy goodness, which Thou hast laid up for them that fear Thee; which Thou hast wrought for them that take their refuge in Thee, in the sight of the sons of men! 
 20  (31:21) Thou hidest them in the covert of Thy presence from the plottings of man; Thou concealest them in a pavilion from the strife of tongues. 
 21  (31:22) Blessed be the LORD; for He hath shown me His wondrous lovingkindness in an entrenched city. 
 22  (31:23) As for me, I said in my haste: 'I am cut off from before Thine eyes'; nevertheless Thou heardest the voice of my supplications when I cried unto Thee. 
 23  (31:24) O love the LORD, all ye His godly ones; the LORD preserveth the faithful, and plentifully repayeth him that acteth haughtily. 
 24  (31:25) Be strong, and let your heart take courage, all ye that wait for the LORD.
