 1 ¶ (75:1) For the Leader; Al-tashheth. A Psalm of Asaph, a Song. (75:2) We give thanks unto Thee, O God, we give thanks, and Thy name is near; men tell of Thy wondrous works. 
 2  (75:3) 'When I take the appointed time, I Myself will judge with equity. 
 3  (75:4) When the earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved, I Myself establish the pillars of it.' Selah 
 4  (75:5) I say unto the arrogant: 'Deal not arrogantly'; and to the wicked: 'Lift not up the horn.' 
 5  (75:6) Lift not up your horn on high; speak not insolence with a haughty neck. 
 6 ¶ (75:7) For neither from the east, nor from the west, nor yet from the wilderness, cometh lifting up. 
 7  (75:8) For God is judge; He putteth down one, and lifteth up another. 
 8  (75:9) For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup, with foaming wine, full of mixture, and He poureth out of the same; surely the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall drain them, and drink them. 
 9  (75:10) But as for me, I will declare for ever, I will sing praises to the God of Jacob. 
 10  (75:11) All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; but the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up.
