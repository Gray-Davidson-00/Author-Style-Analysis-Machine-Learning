 1 ¶ (4:1) For the Leader; with string-music. A Psalm of David. (4:2) Answer me when I call, O God of my righteousness, Thou who didst set me free when I was in distress; be gracious unto me, and hear my prayer. 
 2  (4:3) O ye sons of men, how long shall my glory be put to shame, in that ye love vanity, and seek after falsehood? Selah 
 3  (4:4) But know that the LORD hath set apart the godly man as His own; the LORD will hear when I call unto Him. 
 4  (4:5) Tremble, and sin not; commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah 
 5  (4:6) Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the LORD. 
 6 ¶ (4:7) Many there are that say: 'Oh that we could see some good!' LORD, lift Thou up the light of Thy countenance upon us. 
 7  (4:8) Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than when their corn and their wine increase. 
 8  (4:9) In peace will I both lay me down and sleep; for Thou, LORD, makest me dwell alone in safety.
