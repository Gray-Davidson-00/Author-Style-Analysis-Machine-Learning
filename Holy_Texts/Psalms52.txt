 1 ¶ (52:1) For the Leader. Maschil of David; (52:2) when Doeg the Edomite came and told Saul, and said unto him: 'David is come to the house of Ahimelech.' (52:3) Why boastest thou thyself of evil, O mighty man? The mercy of God endureth continually. 
 2  (52:4) Thy tongue deviseth destruction; like a sharp razor, working deceitfully. 
 3  (52:5) Thou lovest evil more than good; falsehood rather than speaking righteousness. Selah 
 4  (52:6) Thou lovest all devouring words, the deceitful tongue. 
 5  (52:7) God will likewise break thee for ever, He will take thee up, and pluck thee out of thy tent, and root thee out of the land of the living. Selah 
 6 ¶ (52:8) The righteous also shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at him: 
 7  (52:9) 'Lo, this is the man that made not God his stronghold; but trusted in the abundance of his riches, and strengthened himself in his wickedness.' 
 8  (52:10) But as for me, I am like a leafy olive-tree in the house of God; I trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever. 
 9  (52:11) I will give Thee thanks for ever, because Thou hast done it; and I will wait for Thy name, for it is good, in the presence of Thy saints.
