 1 ¶ (64:1) For the Leader. A Psalm of David. (64:2) Hear my voice, O God, in my complaint; preserve my life from the terror of the enemy. 
 2  (64:3) Hide me from the council of evil-doers; from the tumult of the workers of iniquity; 
 3  (64:4) Who have whet their tongue like a sword, and have aimed their arrow, a poisoned word; 
 4  (64:5) That they may shoot in secret places at the blameless; suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not. 
 5  (64:6) They encourage one another in an evil matter; they converse of laying snares secretly; they ask, who would see them. 
 6  (64:7) They search out iniquities, they have accomplished a diligent search; even in the inward thought of every one, and the deep heart. 
 7 ¶ (64:8) But God doth shoot at them with an arrow suddenly; thence are their wounds. 
 8  (64:9) So they make their own tongue a stumbling unto themselves; all that see them shake the head. 
 9  (64:10 And all men fear; and they declare the work of God, and understand His doing. 
 10  (64:11) The righteous shall be glad in the LORD, and shall take refuge in Him; and all the upright in heart shall glory.
