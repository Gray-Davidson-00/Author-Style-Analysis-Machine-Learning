 1 ¶ (38:1) A Psalm of David, to make memorial. (38:2) O LORD, rebuke me not in Thine anger; neither chasten me in Thy wrath. 
 2  (38:3) For Thine arrows are gone deep into me, and Thy hand is come down upon me. 
 3  (38:4) There is no soundness in my flesh because of Thine indignation; neither is there any health in my bones because of my sin. 
 4  (38:5) For mine iniquities are gone over my head; as a heavy burden they are too heavy for me. 
 5  (38:6) My wounds are noisome, they fester, because of my foolishness. 
 6  (38:7) I am bent and bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day. 
 7  (38:8) For my loins are filled with burning; and there is no soundness in my flesh. 
 8  (38:9) I am benumbed and sore crushed; I groan by reason of the moaning of my heart. 
 9  (38:10) Lord, all my desire is before Thee; and my sighing is not hid from Thee. 
 10  (38:11) My heart fluttereth, my strength faileth me; as for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me. 
 11  (38:12) My friends and my companions stand aloof from my plague; and my kinsmen stand afar off. 
 12 ¶ (38:13) They also that seek after my life lay snares for me; and they that seek my hurt speak crafty devices, and utter deceits all the day. 
 13  (38:14) But I am as a deaf man, I hear not; and I am as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth. 
 14  (38:15) Yea, I am become as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no arguments. 
 15  (38:16) For in Thee, O LORD, do I hope; Thou wilt answer, O Lord my God. 
 16  (38:17) For I said: 'Lest they rejoice over me; when my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me.' 
 17  (38:18) For I am ready to halt, and my pain is continually before me. 
 18  (38:19) For I do declare mine iniquity; I am full of care because of my sin. 
 19  (38:20) But mine enemies are strong in health; and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied. 
 20  (38:21) They also that repay evil for good are adversaries unto me, because I follow the thing that is good. 
 21  (38:22) Forsake me not, O LORD; O my God, be not far from me. 
 22  (38:23) Make haste to help me, O Lord, my salvation.
