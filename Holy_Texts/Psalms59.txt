 1 ¶ (59:1) For the Leader; Al-tashheth. A Psalm of David; Michtam; when Saul sent, and they watched the house to kill him. (59:2) Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God; set me on high from them that rise up against me. 
 2  (59:3) Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from the men of blood. 
 3  (59:4) For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul; the impudent gather themselves together against me; not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O LORD. 
 4  (59:5) Without my fault, they run and prepare themselves; awake Thou to help me, and behold. 
 5  (59:6) Thou therefore, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, arouse Thyself to punish all the nations; show no mercy to any iniquitous traitors. Selah 
 6  (59:7) They return at evening, they howl like a dog, and go round about the city. 
 7  (59:8) Behold, they belch out with their mouth; swords are in their lips: 'For who doth hear?' 
 8 ¶ (59:9) But Thou, O LORD, shalt laugh at them; Thou shalt have all the nations in derision. 
 9  (59:10) Because of his strength, I will wait for Thee; for God is my high tower. 
 10  (59:11) The God of my mercy will come to meet me; God will let me gaze upon mine adversaries. 
 11  (59:12) Slay them not, lest my people forget, make them wander to and fro by Thy power, and bring them down, O Lord our shield. 
 12  (59:13) For the sin of their mouth, and the words of their lips, let them even be taken in their pride, and for cursing and lying which they speak. 
 13  (59:14) Consume them in wrath, consume them, that they be no more; and let them know that God ruleth in Jacob, unto the ends of the earth. Selah 
 14  (59:15) And they return at evening, they howl like a dog, and go round about the city; 
 15  (59:16) They wander up and down to devour, and tarry all night if they have not their fill. 
 16  (59:17) But as for me, I will sing of Thy strength; yea, I will sing aloud of Thy mercy in the morning; for Thou hast been my high tower, and a refuge in the day of my distress. 
 17  (59:18) O my strength, unto Thee will I sing praises; for God is my high tower, the God of my mercy.
