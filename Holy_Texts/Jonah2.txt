 1 ¶ (2:2) Then Jonah prayed unto the LORD his God out of the fish's belly. 
 2  (2:3) And he said: I called out of mine affliction unto the LORD, and He answered me; out of the belly of the nether-world cried I, and Thou heardest my voice. 
 3  (2:4) For Thou didst cast me into the depth, in the heart of the seas, and the flood was round about me; all Thy waves and Thy billows passed over me. 
 4  (2:5) And I said: 'I am cast out from before Thine eyes'; yet I will look again toward Thy holy temple. 
 5  (2:6) The waters compassed me about, even to the soul; the deep was round about me; the weeds were wrapped about my head. 
 6  (2:7) I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her bars closed upon me for ever; yet hast Thou brought up my life from the pit, O LORD my God. 
 7  (2:8) When my soul fainted within me, I remembered the LORD; and my prayer came in unto Thee, into Thy holy temple. 
 8  (2:9) They that regard lying vanities forsake their own mercy. 
 9  (2:10) But I will sacrifice unto Thee with the voice of thanksgiving; that which I have vowed I will pay. Salvation is of the LORD. 
 10 ¶ (2:11) And the LORD spoke unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land.
