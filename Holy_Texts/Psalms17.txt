 1 ¶ A Prayer of David. Hear the right, O LORD, attend unto my cry; give ear unto my prayer from lips without deceit. 
 2  Let my judgment come forth from Thy presence; let Thine eyes behold equity. 
 3  Thou hast tried my heart, Thou hast visited it in the night; Thou hast tested me, and Thou findest not that I had a thought which should not pass my mouth. 
 4  As for the doings of men, by the word of Thy lips I have kept me from the ways of the violent. 
 5  My steps have held fast to Thy paths, my feet have not slipped. 
 6  As for me, I call upon Thee, for Thou wilt answer me, O God; incline Thine ear unto me, hear my speech. 
 7  Make passing great Thy mercies, O Thou that savest by Thy right hand from assailants them that take refuge in Thee. 
 8 ¶ Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me in the shadow of Thy wings, 
 9  From the wicked that oppress, my deadly enemies, that compass me about. 
 10  Their gross heart they have shut tight, with their mouth they speak proudly. 
 11  At our every step they have now encompassed us; they set their eyes to cast us down to the earth. 
 12  He is like a lion that is eager to tear in pieces, and like a young lion lurking in secret places. 
 13  Arise, O LORD, confront him, cast him down; deliver my soul from the wicked, by Thy sword; 
 14  From men, by Thy hand, O LORD, from men of the world, whose portion is in this life, and whose belly Thou fillest with Thy treasure; who have children in plenty, and leave their abundance to their babes. 
 15  As for me, I shall behold Thy face in righteousness; I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with Thy likeness.
