 1 ¶ A Song of Ascents. 'Much have they afflicted me from my youth up', let Israel now say; 
 2  'Much have they afflicted me from my youth up; but they have not prevailed against me. 
 3  The plowers plowed upon my back; they made long their furrows. 
 4  The LORD is righteous; He hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked.' 
 5 ¶ Let them be ashamed and turned backward, all they that hate Zion. 
 6  Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, which withereth afore it springeth up; 
 7  Wherewith the reaper filleth not his hand, nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom. 
 8  Neither do they that go by say: 'The blessing of the LORD be upon you; we bless you in the name of the LORD.'
