 1 ¶ (65:1) For the Leader. A Psalm. A Song of David. (65:2) Praise waiteth for Thee, O God, in Zion; and unto Thee the vow is performed. 
 2  (65:3) O Thou that hearest prayer, unto Thee doth all flesh come. 
 3  (65:4) The tale of iniquities is too heavy for me; as for our transgressions, Thou wilt pardon them. 
 4  (65:5) Happy is the man whom Thou choosest, and bringest near, that he may dwell in Thy courts; may we be satisfied with the goodness of Thy house, the holy place of Thy temple! 
 5  (65:6) With wondrous works dost Thou answer us in righteousness, O God of our salvation; Thou the confidence of all the ends of the earth, and of the far distant seas; 
 6 ¶ (65:7) Who by Thy strength settest fast the mountains, who art girded about with might; 
 7  (65:8) Who stillest the roaring of the seas, the roaring of their waves, and the tumult of the peoples; 
 8  (65:9) So that they that dwell in the uttermost parts stand in awe of Thy signs; Thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice. 
 9  (65:10) Thou hast remembered the earth, and watered her, greatly enriching her, with the river of God that is full of water; Thou preparest them corn, for so preparest Thou her. 
 10  (65:11) Watering her ridges abundantly, settling down the furrows thereof, Thou makest her soft with showers; Thou blessest the growth thereof. 
 11  (65:12) Thou crownest the year with Thy goodness; and Thy paths drop fatness. 
 12  (65:13) The pastures of the wilderness do drop; and the hills are girded with joy. 
 13  (65:14) The meadows are clothed with flocks; the valleys also are covered over with corn; they shout for joy, yea, they sing.
