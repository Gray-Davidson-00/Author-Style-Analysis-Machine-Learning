 1 ¶ Cast thy bread upon the waters, for thou shalt find it after many days. 
 2  Divide a portion into seven, yea, even into eight; for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth. 
 3  If the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth; and if a tree fall in the south, or in the north, in the place where the tree falleth, there shall it be. 
 4  He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap. 
 5  As thou knowest not what is the way of the wind, nor how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child; even so thou knowest not the work of God who doeth all things. 
 6  In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thy hand; for thou knowest not which shall prosper, whether this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good. 
 7 ¶ And the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun. 
 8  For if a man live many years, let him rejoice in them all, and remember the days of darkness, for they shall be many. all that cometh is vanity. 
 9  Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thy heart, and in the sight of thine eyes; but know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment. 
 10  Therefore remove vexation from thy heart, and put away evil from thy flesh; for childhood and youth are vanity.
