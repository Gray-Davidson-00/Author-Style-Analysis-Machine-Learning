 1 ¶ A Psalm of David. The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? The LORD is the stronghold of my life; of whom shall I be afraid? 
 2  When evil-doers came upon me to eat up my flesh, even mine adversaries and my foes, they stumbled and fell. 
 3  Though a host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear; though war should rise up against me, even then will I be confident. 
 4  One thing have I asked of the LORD, that will I seek after: that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to behold the graciousness of the LORD, and to visit early in His temple. 
 5  For He concealeth me in His pavilion in the day of evil; He hideth me in the covert of His tent; He lifteth me up upon a rock. 
 6  And now shall my head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me; and I will offer in His tabernacle sacrifices with trumpet-sound; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the LORD. 
 7 ¶ Hear, O LORD, when I call with my voice, and be gracious unto me, and answer me. 
 8  In Thy behalf my heart hath said: 'Seek ye My face'; Thy face, LORD, will I seek. 
 9  Hide not Thy face far from me; put not Thy servant away in anger; Thou hast been my help; cast me not off, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation. 
 10  For though my father and my mother have forsaken me, the LORD will take me up. 
 11  Teach me Thy way, O LORD; and lead me in an even path, because of them that lie in wait for me. 
 12  Deliver me not over unto the will of mine adversaries; for false witnesses are risen up against me, and such as breathe out violence. 
 13  If I had not believed to look upon the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living!-- 
 14  Wait on the LORD; be strong, and let thy heart take courage; yea, wait thou for the LORD.
