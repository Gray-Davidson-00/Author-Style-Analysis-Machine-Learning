 1 ¶ (77:1) For the Leader; for Jeduthun. A Psalm of Asaph. (77:2) I will lift up my voice unto God, an cry; I will lift up my voice unto God, that He may give ear unto me. 
 2  (77:3) In the day of my trouble I seek the Lord; with my hand uplifted, mine eye streameth in the night without ceasing; my soul refuseth to be comforted. 
 3  (77:4) When I think thereon, O God, I must moan; when I muse thereon, my spirit fainteth. Selah 
 4  (77:5) Thou holdest fast the lids of mine eyes; I am troubled, and cannot speak. 
 5  (77:6) I have pondered the days of old, the years of ancient times. 
 6  (77:7) In the night I will call to remembrance my song; I will commune with mine own heart; and my spirit maketh diligent search: 
 7  (77:8) 'Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will He be favourable no more? 
 8  (77:9) Is His mercy clean gone for ever? Is His promise come to an end for evermore? 
 9  (77:10) Hath God forgotten to be gracious? Hath He in anger shut up his compassions?' Selah 
 10  (77:11) And I say: 'This is my weakness, that the right hand of the Most High could change. 
 11 ¶ (77:12) I will make mention of the deeds of the LORD; yea, I will remember Thy wonders of old. 
 12  (77:13) I will meditate also upon all Thy work, and muse on Thy doings.' 
 13  (77:14) O God, Thy way is in holiness; who is a great god like unto God? 
 14  (77:15) Thou art the God that doest wonders; Thou hast made known Thy strength among the peoples. 
 15  (77:16) Thou hast with Thine arm redeemed Thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah 
 16  (77:17) The waters saw Thee, O God; the waters saw Thee, they were in pain; the depths also trembled. 
 17  (77:18) The clouds flooded forth waters; the skies sent out a sound; Thine arrows also went abroad. 
 18  (77:19) The voice of Thy thunder was in the whirlwind; the lightnings lighted up the world; the earth trembled and shook. 
 19  (77:20) Thy way was in the sea, and Thy path in the great waters, and Thy footsteps were not known. 
 20  (77:21) Thou didst lead Thy people like a flock, by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
