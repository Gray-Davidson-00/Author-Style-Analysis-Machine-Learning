 1 ¶ The LORD reigneth; let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of isles be glad. 
 2  Clouds and darkness are round about Him; righteousness and justice are the foundation of His throne. 
 3  A fire goeth before Him, and burneth up His adversaries round about. 
 4  His lightnings lighted up the world; the earth saw, and trembled. 
 5  The mountains melted like wax at the presence of the LORD, at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth. 
 6  The heavens declared His righteousness, and all the peoples saw His glory. 
 7  Ashamed be all they that serve graven images, that boast themselves of things of nought; bow down to Him, all ye gods. 
 8 ¶ Zion heard and was glad, and the daughters of Judah rejoiced; because of Thy judgments, O LORD. 
 9  For Thou, LORD, art most high above all the earth; Thou art exalted far above all gods. 
 10  O ye that love the LORD, hate evil; He preserveth the souls of His saints; He delivered them out of the hand of the wicked. 
 11  Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart. 
 12  Be glad in the LORD, ye righteous; and give thanks to His holy name.
