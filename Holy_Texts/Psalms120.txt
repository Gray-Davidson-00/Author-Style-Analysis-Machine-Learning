 1 ¶ A Song of Ascents. In my distress I called unto the LORD, and He answered me. 
 2  O LORD, deliver my soul from lying lips, from a deceitful tongue. 
 3  What shall be given unto thee, and what shall be done more unto thee, thou deceitful tongue? 
 4  Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of broom. 
 5 ¶ Woe is me, that I sojourn with Meshech, that I dwell beside the tents of Kedar! 
 6  My soul hath full long had her dwelling with him that hateth peace. 
 7  I am all peace; but when I speak, they are for war.
