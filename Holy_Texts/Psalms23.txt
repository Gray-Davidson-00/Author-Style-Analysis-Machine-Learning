 1 ¶ A Psalm of David. The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want. 
 2  He maketh me to lie down in green pastures; He leadeth me beside the still waters. 
 3  He restoreth my soul; He guideth me in straight paths for His name's sake. 
 4  Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me; Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me. 
 5  Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies; Thou hast anointed my head with oil; my cup runneth over. 
 6  Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life; and I shall dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.
