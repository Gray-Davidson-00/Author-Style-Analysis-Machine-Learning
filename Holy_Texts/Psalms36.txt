 1 ¶ (36:1) For the Leader. A Psalm of David the servant of the LORD. (36:2) Transgression speaketh to the wicked, methinks-- there is no fear of God before his eyes. 
 2  (36:3) For it flattereth him in his eyes, until his iniquity be found, and he be hated. 
 3  (36:4) The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit; he hath left off to be wise, to do good. 
 4  (36:5) He deviseth iniquity upon his bed; he setteth himself in a way that is not good; he abhorreth not evil. 
 5 ¶ (36:6) Thy lovingkindness, O LORD, is in the heavens; Thy faithfulness reacheth unto the skies. 
 6  (36:7) Thy righteousness is like the mighty mountains; Thy judgments are like the great deep; man and beast Thou preservest, O LORD. 
 7  (36:8) How precious is Thy lovingkindness, O God! and the children of men take refuge in the shadow of Thy wings. 
 8  (36:9) They are abundantly satisfied with the fatness of Thy house; and Thou makest them drink of the river of Thy pleasures. 
 9  (36:10) For with Thee is the fountain of life; in Thy light do we see light. 
 10  (36:11) O continue Thy lovingkindness unto them that know Thee; and Thy righteousness to the upright in heart. 
 11  (36:12) Let not the foot of pride overtake me, and let not the hand of the wicked drive me away. 
 12  (36:13) There are the workers of iniquity fallen; they are thrust down, and are not able to rise.
