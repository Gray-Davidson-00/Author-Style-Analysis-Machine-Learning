 1 ¶ And he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to accuse him. 
 2  And the LORD said unto Satan: 'The LORD rebuke thee, O Satan, yea, the LORD that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee; is not this man a brand plucked out of the fire?' 
 3  Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the angel. 
 4  And he answered and spoke unto those that stood before him, saying: 'Take the filthy garments from off him.' And unto him he said: 'Behold, I cause thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with robes.' 
 5  And I said: 'Let them set a fair mitre upon his head.' So they set a fair mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments; and the angel of the LORD stood by. 
 6  And the angel of the LORD forewarned Joshua, saying: 
 7  'Thus saith the LORD of hosts: If thou wilt walk in My ways, and if thou wilt keep My charge, and wilt also judge My house, and wilt also keep My courts, then I will give thee free access among these that stand by. 
 8 ¶ Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou and thy fellows that sit before thee; for they are men that are a sign; for, behold, I will bring forth My servant the Shoot. 
 9  For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one stone are seven facets; behold, I will engrave the graving thereof, saith the LORD of hosts: And I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day. 
 10  In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, shall ye call every man his neighbour under the vine and under the fig-tree.
