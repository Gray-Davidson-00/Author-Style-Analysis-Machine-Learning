 1 ¶ (19:1) For the Leader. A Psalm of David. (19:2) The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth His handiwork; 
 2  (19:3) Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night revealeth knowledge; 
 3  (19:4) There is no speech, there are no words, neither is their voice heard. 
 4  (19:5) Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them hath He set a tent for the sun, 
 5  (19:6) Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a strong man to run his course. 
 6  (19:7) His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it; and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof. 
 7 ¶ (19:8) The law of the LORD is perfect, restoring the soul; the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple. 
 8  (19:9) The precepts of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart; the commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes. 
 9  (19:10) The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever; the ordinances of the LORD are true, they are righteous altogether; 
 10  (19:11) More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold; sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb. 
 11  (19:12) Moreover by them is Thy servant warned; in keeping of them there is great reward. 
 12  (19:13) Who can discern his errors? Clear Thou me from hidden faults. 
 13  (19:14) Keep back Thy servant also from presumptuous sins, that they may not have dominion over me; then shall I be faultless, and I shall be clear from great transgression. 
 14  (19:15) Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable before Thee, O LORD, my Rock, and my Redeemer.
