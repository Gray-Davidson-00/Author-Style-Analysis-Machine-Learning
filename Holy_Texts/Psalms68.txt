 1  (68:1) For the Leader. A Psalm of David, a Song. (68:2) Let God arise, let His enemies be scattered; and let them that hate Him flee before Him. 
 2  (68:3) As smoke is driven away, so drive them away; as wax melteth before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God. 
 3  (68:4) But let the righteous be glad, let them exult before God; yea, let them rejoice with gladness. 
 4  (68:5) Sing unto God, sing praises to His name; extol Him that rideth upon the skies, whose name is the LORD; and exult ye before Him. 
 5  (68:6) A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, is God in His holy habitation. 
 6  (68:7) God maketh the solitary to dwell in a house; He bringeth out the prisoners into prosperity; the rebellious dwell but in a parched land. 
 7  (68:8) O God, when Thou wentest forth before Thy people, when Thou didst march through the wilderness; Selah 
 8  (68:9) The earth trembled, the heavens also dropped at the presence of God; even yon Sinai trembled at the presence of God, the God of Israel. 
 9  (68:10) A bounteous rain didst Thou pour down, O God; when Thine inheritance was weary, Thou didst confirm it. 
 10  (68:11) Thy flock settled therein; Thou didst prepare in Thy goodness for the poor, O God. 
 11  (68:12) The Lord giveth the word; the women that proclaim the tidings are a great host. 
 12  (68:13) Kings of armies flee, they flee; and she that tarrieth at home divideth the spoil. 
 13  (68:14) When ye lie among the sheepfolds, the wings of the dove are covered with silver, and her pinions with the shimmer of gold. 
 14  (68:15) When the Almighty scattereth kings therein, it snoweth in Zalmon. 
 15  (68:16) A mountain of God is the mountain of Bashan; a mountain of peaks is the mountain of Bashan. 
 16  (68:17) Why look ye askance, ye mountains of peaks, at the mountain which God hath desired for His abode? Yea, the LORD will dwell therein for ever. 
 17  (68:18) The chariots of God are myriads, even thousands upon thousands; the Lord is among them, as in Sinai, in holiness. 
 18  (68:19) Thou hast ascended on high, Thou hast led captivity captive; Thou hast received gifts among men, yea, among the rebellious also, that the LORD God might dwell there. 
 19  (68:20) Blessed be the Lord, day by day He beareth our burden, even the God who is our salvation. Selah 
 20  (68:21) God is unto us a God of deliverances; and unto GOD the Lord belong the issues of death. 
 21  (68:22) Surely God will smite through the head of His enemies, the hairy scalp of him that goeth about in his guiltiness. 
 22  (68:23) The Lord said: 'I will bring back from Bashan, I will bring them back from the depths of the sea; 
 23  (68:24) That thy foot may wade through blood, that the tongue of thy dogs may have its portion from thine enemies.' 
 24  (68:25) They see Thy goings, O God, even the goings of my God, my King, in holiness. 
 25  (68:26) The singers go before, the minstrels follow after, in the midst of damsels playing upon timbrels. 
 26  (68:27) 'Bless ye God in full assemblies, even the Lord, ye that are from the fountain of Israel.' 
 27  (68:28) There is Benjamin, the youngest, ruling them, the princes of Judah their council, the princes of Zebulun, the princes of Naphtali. 
 28  (68:29) Thy God hath commanded thy strength; be strong, O God, Thou that hast wrought for us 
 29  (68:30) Out of Thy temple at Jerusalem, whither kings shall bring presents unto Thee. 
 30  (68:31) Rebuke the wild beast of the reeds, the multitude of the bulls, with the calves of the peoples, every one submitting himself with pieces of silver; He hath scattered the peoples that delight in war! 
 31  (68:32) Nobles shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall hasten to stretch out her hands unto God. 
 32  (68:33) Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth; O sing praises unto the Lord; Selah 
 33  (68:34) To Him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens, which are of old; lo, He uttereth His voice, a mighty voice. 
 34  (68:35) Ascribe ye strength unto God; His majesty is over Israel, and His strength is in the skies. 
 35  (68:36) Awful is God out of thy holy places; the God of Israel, He giveth strength and power unto the people; blessed be God.
