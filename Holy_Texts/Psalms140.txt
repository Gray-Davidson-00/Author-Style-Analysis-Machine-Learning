 1 ¶ (140:1) For the Leader. A Psalm of David. (140:2) Deliver me, O LORD, from the evil man; preserve me from the violent man; 
 2  (140:3) Who devise evil things in their heart; every day do they stir up wars. 
 3  (140:4) They have sharpened their tongue like a serpent; vipers' venom is under their lips. Selah 
 4  (140:5) Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked; preserve me from the violent man; who have purposed to make my steps slip. 
 5  (140:6) The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords; they have spread a net by the wayside; they have set gins for me. Selah 
 6  (140:7) I have said unto the LORD: 'Thou art my God'; give ear, O LORD, unto the voice of my supplications. 
 7  (140:8) O GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation, who hast screened my head in the day of battle, 
 8 ¶ (140:9) Grant not, O LORD, the desires of the wicked; further not his evil device, so that they exalt themselves. Selah 
 9  (140:10) As for the head of those that compass me about, let the mischief of their own lips cover them. 
 10  (140:11) Let burning coals fall upon them; let them be cast into the fire, into deep pits, that they rise not up again. 
 11  (140:12) A slanderer shall not be established in the earth; the violent and evil man shall be hunted with thrust upon thrust. 
 12  (140:13) I know that the LORD will maintain the cause of the poor, and the right of the needy. 
 13  (140:14) Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto Thy name; the upright shall dwell in Thy presence.
