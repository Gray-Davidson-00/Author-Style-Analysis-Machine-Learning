 1 ¶ (62:1) For the Leader; for Jeduthun. A Psalm of David. (62:2) Only for God doth my soul wait in stillness; from Him cometh my salvation. 
 2  (62:3) He only is my rock and my salvation, my high tower, I shall not be greatly moved. 
 3  (62:4) How long will ye set upon a man, that ye may slay him, all of you, as a leaning wall, a tottering fence? 
 4  (62:5) They only devise to thrust him down from his height, delighting in lies; they bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. Selah 
 5  (62:6) Only for God wait thou in stillness, my soul; for from Him cometh my hope. 
 6  (62:7) He only is my rock and my salvation, my high tower, I shall not be moved. 
 7  (62:8) Upon God resteth my salvation and my glory; the rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God. 
 8 ¶ (62:9) Trust in Him at all times, ye people; pour out your heart before Him; God is a refuge for us. Selah 
 9  (62:10) Men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie; if they be laid in the balances, they are together lighter than vanity. 
 10  (62:11) Trust not in oppression, and put not vain hope in robbery; if riches increase, set not your heart thereon. 
 11  (62:12) God hath spoken once, twice have I heard this: that strength belongeth unto God; 
 12  (62:13) Also unto Thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy; for Thou renderest to every man according to his work.
