 1 ¶ (41:1) For the Leader. A Psalm of David. (41:2) Happy is he that considereth the poor; the LORD will deliver him in the day of evil. 
 2  (41:3) The LORD preserve him, and keep him alive, let him be called happy in the land; and deliver not Thou him unto the greed of his enemies. 
 3  (41:4) The LORD support him upon the bed of illness; mayest Thou turn all his lying down in his sickness. 
 4  (41:5) As for me, I said: 'O LORD, be gracious unto me; heal my soul; for I have sinned against Thee.' 
 5 ¶ (41:6) Mine enemies speak evil of me: 'When shall he die, and his name perish?' 
 6  (41:7) And if one come to see me, he speaketh falsehood; his heart gathereth iniquity to itself; when he goeth abroad, he speaketh of it. 
 7  (41:8) All that hate me whisper together against me, against me do they devise my hurt: 
 8  (41:9) 'An evil thing cleaveth fast unto him; and now that he lieth, he shall rise up no more.' 
 9  (41:10) Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, who did eat of my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me. 
 10  (41:11) But Thou, O LORD, be gracious unto me, and raise me up, that I may requite them. 
 11  (41:12) By this I know that Thou delightest in me, that mine enemy doth not triumph over me. 
 12  (41:13) And as for me, Thou upholdest me because of mine integrity, and settest me before Thy face for ever. 
 13  (41:14) Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting and to everlasting. Amen, and Amen. BOOK II
