 1 ¶ For the Leader; upon the Gittith. A Psalm of Asaph. (81:2) Sing aloud unto God our strength; shout unto the God of Jacob. 
 2  (81:3) Take up the melody, and sound the timbrel, the sweet harp with the psaltery. 
 3  (81:4) Blow the horn at the new moon, at the full moon for our feast-day. 
 4  (81:5) For it is a statute for Israel, an ordinance of the God of Jacob. 
 5  (81:6) He appointed it in Joseph for a testimony, when He went forth against the land of Egypt. The speech of one that I knew not did I hear: 
 6  (81:7) 'I removed his shoulder from the burden; His hands were freed from the basket. 
 7  (81:8) Thou didst call in trouble, and I rescued thee; I answered thee in the secret place of thunder; I proved thee at the waters of Meribah. Selah 
 8 ¶ (81:9) Hear, O My people, and I will admonish thee: O Israel, if thou wouldest hearken unto Me! 
 9  (81:10) There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou worship any foreign god. 
 10  (81:11) I am the LORD thy God, who brought thee up out of the land of Egypt; open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it. 
 11  (81:12) But My people hearkened not to My voice; and Israel would none of Me. 
 12  (81:13) So I let them go after the stubbornness of their heart, that they might walk in their own counsels. 
 13  (81:14) Oh that My people would hearken unto Me, that Israel would walk in My ways! 
 14  (81:15) I would soon subdue their enemies, and turn My hand against their adversaries. 
 15  (81:16) The haters of the LORD should dwindle away before Him; and their punishment should endure for ever. 
 16  (81:17) They should also be fed with the fat of wheat; and with honey out of the rock would I satisfy thee.'
