 1 ¶ A Psalm. O sing unto the LORD a new song; for He hath done marvellous things; His right hand, and His holy arm, hath wrought salvation for Him. 
 2  The LORD hath made known His salvation; His righteousness hath He revealed in the sight of the nations. 
 3  He hath remembered His mercy and His faithfulness toward the house of Israel; all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God. 
 4 ¶ Shout unto the LORD, all the earth; break forth and sing for joy, yea, sing praises. 
 5  Sing praises unto the LORD with the harp; with the harp and the voice of melody. 
 6  With trumpets and sound of the horn shout ye before the King, the LORD. 
 7  Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein; 
 8  Let the floods clap their hands; let the mountains sing for joy together; 
 9  Before the LORD, for He is come to judge the earth; He will judge the world with righteousness, and the peoples with equity.
