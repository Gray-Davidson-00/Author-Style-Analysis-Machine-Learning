 1 ¶ (7:1) Shiggaion of David, which he sang unto the LORD, concerning Cush a Benjamite. (7:2) O LORD my God, in Thee have I taken refuge; save me from all them that pursue me, and deliver me; 
 2  (7:3) Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver. 
 3  (7:4) O LORD my God, if I have done this; if there be iniquity in my hands; 
 4  (7:5) If I have requited him that did evil unto me, or spoiled mine adversary unto emptiness; 
 5  (7:6) Let the enemy pursue my soul, and overtake it, and tread my life down to the earth; yea, let him lay my glory in the dust. Selah 
 6  (7:7) Arise, O LORD, in Thine anger, lift up Thyself in indignation against mine adversaries; yea, awake for me at the judgment which Thou hast commanded. 
 7  (7:8) And let the congregation of the peoples compass Thee about, and over them return Thou on high. 
 8  (7:9) O LORD, who ministerest judgment to the peoples, judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity that is in me. 
 9  (7:10) Oh that a full measure of evil might come upon the wicked, and that Thou wouldest establish the righteous; for the righteous God trieth the heart and reins. 
 10 ¶ (7:11) My shield is with God, who saveth the upright in heart. 
 11  (7:12) God is a righteous judge, yea, a God that hath indignation every day: 
 12  (7:13) If a man turn not, He will whet His sword, He hath bent His bow, and made it ready; 
 13  (7:14) He hath also prepared for him the weapons of death, yea, His arrows which He made sharp. 
 14  (7:15) Behold, he travaileth with iniquity; yea, he conceiveth mischief, and bringeth forth falsehood. 
 15  (7:16) He hath digged a pit, and hollowed it, and is fallen into the ditch which he made. 
 16  (7:17) His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violence shall come down upon his own pate. 
 17  (7:18) I will give thanks unto the LORD according to His righteousness; and will sing praise to the name of the LORD Most High.
