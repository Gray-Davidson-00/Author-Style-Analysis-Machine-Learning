 1 ¶ And in that day thou shalt say: 'I will give thanks unto Thee, O LORD; for though Thou was angry with me, Thine anger is turned away, and Thou comfortest me. 
 2  Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and will not be afraid; for GOD the LORD is my strength and song; and He is become my salvation.' 
 3  Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation. 
 4 ¶ And in that day shall ye say: 'Give thanks unto the LORD, proclaim His name, declare His doings among the peoples, make mention that His name is exalted. 
 5  Sing unto the LORD; for He hath done gloriously; this is made known in all the earth. 
 6  Cry aloud and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion, for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee.'
