 1 ¶ A Song of Ascents. They that trust in the LORD are as mount Zion, which cannot be moved, but abideth for ever. 
 2  As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the LORD is round about His people, from this time forth and for ever. 
 3  For the rod of wickedness shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous; that the righteous put not forth their hands unto iniquity. 
 4 ¶ Do good, O LORD, unto the good, and to them that are upright in their hearts. 
 5  But as for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the LORD will lead them away with the workers of iniquity. Peace be upon Israel.
