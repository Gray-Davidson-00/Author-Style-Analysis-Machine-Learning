 1 ¶ Hallelujah. I will give thanks unto the LORD with my whole heart, in the council of the upright, and in the congregation. 
 2  The works of the LORD are great, sought out of all them that have delight therein. 
 3  His work is glory and majesty; and His righteousness endureth for ever. 
 4  He hath made a memorial for His wonderful works; the LORD is gracious and full of compassion. 
 5  He hath given food unto them that fear Him; He will ever be mindful of His covenant. 
 6 ¶ He hath declared to His people the power of His works, in giving them the heritage of the nations. 
 7  The works of His hands are truth and justice; all His precepts are sure. 
 8  They are established for ever and ever, they are done in truth and uprightness. 
 9  He hath sent redemption unto His people; He hath commanded His covenant for ever; Holy and awful is His name. 
 10  The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom; a good understanding have all they that do thereafter; His praise endureth for ever.
