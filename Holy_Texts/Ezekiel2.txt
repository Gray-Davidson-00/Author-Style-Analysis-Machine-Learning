 1 ¶ And He said unto me: 'Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak with thee.' 
 2  And spirit entered into me when He spoke unto me, and set me upon my feet; and I heard Him that spoke unto me. 
 3  And He said unto me: 'Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to rebellious nations, that have rebelled against Me; they and their fathers have transgressed against Me, even unto this very day; 
 4  and the children are brazen-faced and stiff-hearted, I do send thee unto them; and thou shalt say unto them: Thus saith the Lord GOD. 
 5  And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear--for they are a rebellious house--yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them. 
 6 ¶ And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though defiers and despisers be with thee, and thou dost dwell among scorpions; be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, for they are a rebellious house. 
 7  And thou shalt speak My words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear; for they are most rebellious. 
 8  And thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee: be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house; open thy mouth, and eat that which I give thee.' 
 9  And when I looked, behold, a hand was put forth unto me; and, lo, a roll of a book was therein; 
 10  and He spread it before me, and it was written within and without; and there was written therein lamentations, and moaning, and woe.
