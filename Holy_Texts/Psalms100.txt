 1 ¶ A Psalm of thanksgiving. Shout unto the LORD, all the earth. 
 2  Serve the LORD with gladness; come before His presence with singing. 
 3  Know ye that the LORD He is God; it is He that hath made us, and we our His, His people, and the flock of His pasture. 
 4  Enter into His gates with thanksgiving, and into His courts with praise; give thanks unto Him, and bless His name. 
 5  For the LORD is good; His mercy endureth for ever; and His faithfulness unto all generations.
