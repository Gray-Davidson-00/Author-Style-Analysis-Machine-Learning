 1 ¶ A Song of Ascents; of David. LORD, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty; neither do I exercise myself in things too great, or in things too wonderful for me. 
 2  Surely I have stilled and quieted my soul; like a weaned child with his mother; my soul is with me like a weaned child. 
 3  O Israel, hope in the LORD from this time forth and for ever.
