 1 ¶ The LORD reigneth; let the peoples tremble; He is enthroned upon the cherubim; let the earth quake. 
 2  The LORD is great in Zion; and He is high above all the peoples. 
 3  Let them praise Thy name as great and awful; Holy is He. 
 4  The strength also of the king who loveth justice--Thou hast established equity, Thou hast executed justice and righteousness in Jacob. 
 5  Exalt ye the LORD our God, and prostrate yourselves at His footstool; Holy is He. 
 6 ¶ Moses and Aaron among His priests, and Samuel among them that call upon His name, did call upon the LORD, and He answered them. 
 7  He spoke unto them in the pillar of cloud; they kept His testimonies, and the statute that He gave them. 
 8  O LORD our God, Thou didst answer them; a forgiving God wast Thou unto them, though Thou tookest vengeance of their misdeeds. 
 9  Exalt ye the LORD our God, and worship at His holy hill; for the LORD our God is holy.
