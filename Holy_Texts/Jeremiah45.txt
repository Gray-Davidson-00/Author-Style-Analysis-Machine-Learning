 1 ¶ The word that Jeremiah the prophet spoke unto Baruch the son of Neriah, when he wrote these words in a book at the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying: 
 2  'Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning thee, O Baruch: Thou didst say: 
 3  Woe is me now! for the LORD hath added sorrow to my pain; I am weary with my groaning, and I find no rest. 
 4  Thus shalt thou say unto him: Thus saith the LORD: Behold, that which I have built will I break down, and that which I have planted I will pluck up; and this in the whole land. 
 5  And seekest thou great things for thyself? seek them not; for, behold, I will bring evil upon all flesh, saith the LORD; but thy life will I give unto thee for a prey in all places whither thou goest.'
