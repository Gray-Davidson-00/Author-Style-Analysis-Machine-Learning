 1 ¶ Be Thou my judge, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation; O deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man. 
 2  For Thou art the God of my strength; why hast Thou cast me off? Why go I mourning under the oppression of the enemy? 
 3  O send out Thy light and Thy truth; let them lead me; let them bring me unto Thy holy mountain, and to Thy dwelling-places. 
 4  Then will I go unto the altar of God, unto God, my exceeding joy; and praise Thee upon the harp, O God, my God. 
 5  Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why moanest thou within me? Hope thou in God; for I shall yet praise Him, the salvation of my countenance, and my God.
