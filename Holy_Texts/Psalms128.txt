 1 ¶ A Song of Ascents. Happy is every one that feareth the LORD, that walketh in His ways. 
 2  When thou eatest the labour of thy hands, happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee. 
 3  Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine, in the innermost parts of thy house; thy children like olive plants, round about thy table. 
 4  Behold, surely thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the LORD. 
 5  The LORD bless thee out of Zion; and see thou the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life; 
 6  And see thy children's children. Peace be upon Israel!
