 1 ¶ Hallelujah. Praise God in His sanctuary; praise Him in the firmament of His power. 
 2  Praise Him for His mighty acts; praise Him according to His abundant greatness. 
 3  Praise Him with the blast of the horn; praise Him with the psaltery and harp. 
 4  Praise Him with the timbrel and dance; praise Him with stringed instruments and the pipe. 
 5  Praise Him with the loud-sounding cymbals; praise Him with the clanging cymbals. 
 6  Let every thing that hath breath praise the LORD. Hallelujah.
