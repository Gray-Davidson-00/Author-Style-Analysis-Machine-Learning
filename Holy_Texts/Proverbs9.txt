 1 ¶ Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars; 
 2  She hath prepared her meat, she hath mingled her wine; she hath also furnished her table. 
 3  She hath sent forth her maidens, she calleth, upon the highest places of the city: 
 4  'Whoso is thoughtless, let him turn in hither'; as for him that lacketh understanding, she saith to him: 
 5  'Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled. 
 6  Forsake all thoughtlessness, and live; and walk in the way of understanding. 
 7  He that correcteth a scorner getteth to himself shame, and he that reproveth a wicked man, it becometh unto him a blot. 
 8  Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee; reprove a wise man, and he will love thee. 
 9  Give to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser; teach a righteous man, and he will increase in learning. 
 10  The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom, and the knowledge of the All-holy is understanding. 
 11  For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy life shall be increased. 
 12  If thou art wise, thou art wise for thyself; and if thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear it.' 
 13 ¶ The woman Folly is riotous; she is thoughtless, and knoweth nothing. 
 14  And she sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city, 
 15  To call to them that pass by, who go right on their ways: 
 16  'Whoso is thoughtless, let him turn in hither'; and as for him that lacketh understanding, she saith to him: 
 17  'Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant.' 
 18  But he knoweth not that the shades are there; that her guests are in the depths of the nether-world.
