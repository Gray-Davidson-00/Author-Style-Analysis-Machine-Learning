 1 ¶ (83:1) A Song, a Psalm of Asaph. (83:2) O God, keep not Thou silence; hold not Thy peace, and be not still, O God. 
 2  (83:3) For, lo, Thine enemies are in an uproar; and they that hate Thee have lifted up the head. 
 3  (83:4) They hold crafty converse against Thy people, and take counsel against Thy treasured ones. 
 4  (83:5) They have said: 'Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.' 
 5  (83:6) For they have consulted together with one consent; against Thee do they make a covenant; 
 6  (83:7) The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites; Moab, and the Hagrites; 
 7  (83:8) Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre; 
 8  (83:9) Assyria also is joined with them; they have been an arm to the children of Lot. Selah 
 9 ¶ (83:10) Do Thou unto them as unto Midian; as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the brook Kishon; 
 10  (83:11) Who were destroyed at En-dor; they became as dung for the earth. 
 11  (83:12) Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb, and like Zebah and Zalmunna all their princes; 
 12  (83:13) Who said: 'Let us take to ourselves in possession the habitations of God.' 
 13  (83:14) O my God, make them like the whirling dust; as stubble before the wind. 
 14  (83:15) As the fire that burneth the forest, and as the flame that setteth the mountains ablaze; 
 15  (83:16) So pursue them with Thy tempest, and affright them with Thy storm. 
 16  (83:17) Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek Thy name, O LORD. 
 17  (83:18) Let them be ashamed and affrighted for ever; yea, let them be abashed and perish; 
 18  (83:19) That they may know that it is Thou alone whose name is the LORD, the Most High over all the earth.
