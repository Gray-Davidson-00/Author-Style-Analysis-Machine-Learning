 1 ¶ A Song of Ascents; of David. I rejoiced when they said unto me: 'Let us go unto the house of the LORD.' 
 2  Our feet are standing within thy gates, O Jerusalem; 
 3  Jerusalem, that art builded as a city that is compact together; 
 4  Whither the tribes went up, even the tribes of the LORD, as a testimony unto Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the LORD. 
 5  For there were set thrones for judgment, the thrones of the house of David. 
 6 ¶ Pray for the peace of Jerusalem; may they prosper that love thee. 
 7  Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces. 
 8  For my brethren and companions' sakes, I will now say: 'Peace be within thee.' 
 9  For the sake of the house of the LORD our God I will seek thy good.
