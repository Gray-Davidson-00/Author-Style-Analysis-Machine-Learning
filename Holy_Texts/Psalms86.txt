 1 ¶ A Prayer of David. Incline Thine ear, O LORD, and answer me; for I am poor and needy. 
 2  Keep my soul, for I am godly; O Thou my God, save Thy servant that trusteth in Thee. 
 3  Be gracious unto me, O Lord; for unto Thee do I cry all the day. 
 4  Rejoice the soul of Thy servant; for unto Thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul. 
 5  For Thou, Lord, art good, and ready to pardon, and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon Thee. 
 6  Give ear, O LORD, unto my prayer; and attend unto the voice of my supplications. 
 7  In the day of my trouble I call upon Thee; for Thou wilt answer me. 
 8 ¶ There is none like unto Thee among the gods, O Lord, and there are no works like Thine. 
 9  All nations whom Thou hast made shall come and prostrate themselves before Thee, O Lord; and they shall glorify Thy name. 
 10  For Thou art great, and doest wondrous things; Thou art God alone. 
 11  Teach me, O LORD, Thy way, that I may walk in Thy truth; make one my heart to fear Thy name. 
 12  I will thank Thee, O Lord my God, with my whole heart; and I will glorify Thy name for evermore. 
 13  For great is Thy mercy toward me; and Thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest nether-world. 
 14  O God, the proud are risen up against me, and the company of violent men have sought after my soul, and have not set Thee before them. 
 15  But Thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy and truth. 
 16  O turn unto me, and be gracious unto me; give Thy strength unto Thy servant, and save the son of Thy handmaid. 
 17  Work in my behalf a sign for good; that they that hate me may see it, and be put to shame, because Thou, LORD, hast helped me, and comforted me.
