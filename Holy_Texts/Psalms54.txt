 1 ¶ (54:1) For the Leader; with string-music. Maschil of David: (54:2) when the Ziphites came and said to Saul: 'Doth not David hide himself with us?' (54:3) O God, save me by Thy name, and right me by Thy might. 
 2  (54:4) O God, hear my prayer; give ear to the words of my mouth. 
 3  (54:5) For strangers are risen up against me, and violent men have sought after my soul; they have not set God before them. Selah 
 4 ¶ (54:6) Behold, God is my helper; the Lord is for me as the upholder of my soul. 
 5  (54:7) He will requite the evil unto them that lie in wait for me; destroy Thou them in Thy truth. 
 6  (54:8) With a freewill-offering will I sacrifice unto Thee; I will give thanks unto Thy name, O LORD, for it is good. 
 7  (54:9) For He hath delivered me out of all trouble; and mine eye hath gazed upon mine enemies.
