 1 ¶ Bel boweth down, Nebo stoopeth; their idols are upon the beasts, and upon the cattle; the things that ye carried about are made a load, a burden to the weary beast. 
 2  They stoop, they bow down together, they could not deliver the burden; and themselves are gone into captivity. 
 3  Hearken unto Me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel, that are borne by Me from the birth, that are carried from the womb: 
 4  Even to old age I am the same, and even to hoar hairs will I carry you; I have made, and I will bear; yea, I will carry, and will deliver. 
 5 ¶ To whom will ye liken Me, and make Me equal, and compare Me, that we may be like? 
 6  Ye that lavish gold out of the bag, and weigh silver in the balance; ye that hire a goldsmith, that he make it a god, to fall down thereto, yea, to worship. 
 7  He is borne upon the shoulder, he is carried, and set in his place, and he standeth, from his place he doth not remove; yea, though one cry unto him, he cannot answer, nor save him out of his trouble. 
 8  Remember this, and stand fast; bring it to mind, O ye transgressors. 
 9  Remember the former things of old: that I am God, and there is none else; I am God, and there is none like Me; 
 10  Declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times things that are not yet done; saying: 'My counsel shall stand, and all My pleasure will I do'; 
 11  Calling a bird of prey from the east, the man of My counsel from a far country; yea, I have spoken, I will also bring it to pass, I have purposed, I will also do it. 
 12  Hearken unto Me, ye stout-hearted, that are far from righteousness: 
 13  I bring near My righteousness, it shall not be far off, and My salvation shall not tarry; and I will place salvation in Zion for Israel My glory.
