 1  (69:1) For the Leader; upon Shoshannim. A Psalm of David. (69:2) Save me, O God; for the waters are come in even unto the soul. 
 2  (69:3) I am sunk in deep mire, where there is no standing; I am come into deep waters, and the flood overwhelmeth me. 
 3  (69:4) I am weary of my crying; my throat is dried; mine eyes fail while I wait for my God. 
 4  (69:5) They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head; they that would cut me off, being mine enemies wrongfully, are many; should I restore that which I took not away? 
 5  (69:6) O God, Thou knowest my folly; and my trespasses are not hid from Thee. 
 6  (69:7) Let not them that wait for Thee be ashamed through me, O Lord GOD of hosts; let not those that seek Thee be brought to confusion through me, O God of Israel. 
 7  (69:8) Because for Thy sake I have borne reproach; confusion hath covered my face. 
 8  (69:9) I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother's children. 
 9  (69:10) Because zeal for Thy house hath eaten me up, and the reproaches of them that reproach Thee are fallen upon me. 
 10  (69:11) And I wept with my soul with fasting, and that became unto me a reproach. 
 11  (69:12) I made sackcloth also my garment, and I became a byword unto them. 
 12  (69:13) They that sit in the gate talk of me; and I am the song of the drunkards. 
 13  (69:14) But as for me, let my prayer be unto Thee, O LORD, in an acceptable time; O God, in the abundance of Thy mercy, answer me with the truth of Thy salvation. 
 14  (69:15) Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink; let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters. 
 15  (69:16) Let not the waterflood overwhelm me, neither let the deep swallow me up; and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me. 
 16  (69:17) Answer me, O LORD, for Thy mercy is good; according to the multitude of Thy compassions turn Thou unto me. 
 17  (69:18) And hide not Thy face from Thy servant; for I am in distress; answer me speedily. 
 18  (69:19) Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it; ransom me because of mine enemies. 
 19  (69:20) Thou knowest my reproach, and my shame, and my confusion; mine adversaries are all before Thee. 
 20  (69:21) Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am sore sick; and I looked for some to show compassion, but there was none; and for comforters, but I found none. 
 21  (69:22) Yea, they put poison into my food; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink. 
 22  (69:23) Let their table before them become a snare; and when they are in peace, let it become a trap. 
 23  (69:24) Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their loins continually to totter. 
 24  (69:25) Pour out Thine indignation upon them, and let the fierceness of Thine anger overtake them. 
 25  (69:26) Let their encampment be desolate; let none dwell in their tents. 
 26  (69:27) For they persecute him whom Thou hast smitten; and they tell of the pain of those whom Thou hast wounded. 
 27  (69:28) Add iniquity unto their iniquity; and let them not come into Thy righteousness. 
 28  (69:29) Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous. 
 29  (69:30) But I am afflicted and in pain; let Thy salvation, O God, set me up on high. 
 30  (69:31) I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify Him with thanksgiving. 
 31  (69:32) And it shall please the LORD better than a bullock that hath horns and hoofs. 
 32  (69:33) The humble shall see it, and be glad; ye that seek after God, let your heart revive. 
 33  (69:34) For the LORD hearkeneth unto the needy, and despiseth not His prisoners. 
 34  (69:35) Let heaven and earth praise Him, the seas, and every thing that moveth therein. 
 35  (69:36) For God will save Zion, and build the cities of Judah; and they shall abide there, and have it in possession. 
 36  (69:37) The seed also of His servants shall inherit it; and they that love His name shall dwell therein.
