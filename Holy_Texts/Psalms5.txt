 1 ¶ (5:1) For the Leader; upon the Nehiloth. A Psalm of David. (5:2) Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation. 
 2  (5:3) Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God; for unto Thee do I pray. 
 3  (5:4) O LORD, in the morning shalt Thou hear my voice; in the morning will I order my prayer unto Thee, and will look forward. 
 4  (5:5) For Thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness; evil shall not sojourn with Thee. 
 5  (5:6) The boasters shall not stand in Thy sight; Thou hatest all workers of iniquity. 
 6  (5:7) Thou destroyest them that speak falsehood; the LORD abhorreth the man of blood and of deceit. 
 7 ¶ (5:8) But as for me, in the abundance of Thy lovingkindness will I come into Thy house; I will bow down toward Thy holy temple in the fear of Thee. 
 8  (5:9) O LORD, lead me in Thy righteousness because of them that lie in wait for me; make Thy way straight before my face. 
 9  (5:10) For there is no sincerity in their mouth; their inward part is a yawning gulf, their throat is an open sepulchre; they make smooth their tongue. 
 10  (5:11) Hold them guilty, O God, let them fall by their own counsels; cast them down in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against Thee. 
 11  (5:12) So shall all those that take refuge in Thee rejoice, they shall ever shout for joy, and Thou shalt shelter them; let them also that love Thy name exult in Thee. 
 12  (5:13) For Thou dost bless the righteous; O LORD, Thou dost encompass him with favour as with a shield.
