 1  I am a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valleys. 
 2  As a lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters. 
 3  As an apple-tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons. Under its shadow I delighted to sit, and its fruit was sweet to my taste. 
 4  He hath brought me to the banqueting-house, and his banner over me is love. 
 5  'Stay ye me with dainties, refresh me with apples; for I am love-sick.' 
 6  Let his left hand be under my head, and his right hand embrace me. 
 7  'I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the gazelles, and by the hinds of the field, that ye awaken not, nor stir up love, until it please.' 
 8  Hark! my beloved! behold, he cometh, leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills. 
 9  My beloved is like a gazelle or a young hart; behold, he standeth behind our wall, he looketh in through the windows, he peereth through the lattice. 
 10  My beloved spoke, and said unto me: 'Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away. 
 11  For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone; 
 12  The flowers appear on the earth; the time of singing is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land; 
 13  The fig-tree putteth forth her green figs, and the vines in blossom give forth their fragrance. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away. 
 14  O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the covert of the cliff, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely.' 
 15  'Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vineyards; for our vineyards are in blossom.' 
 16  My beloved is mine, and I am his, that feedeth among the lilies. 
 17  Until the day breathe, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be thou like a gazelle or a young hart upon the mountains of spices.
