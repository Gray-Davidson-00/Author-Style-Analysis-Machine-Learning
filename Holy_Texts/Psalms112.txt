 1 ¶ Hallelujah. Happy is the man that feareth the LORD, that delighteth greatly in His commandments. 
 2  His seed shall be mighty upon earth; the generation of the upright shall be blessed. 
 3  Wealth and riches are in his house; and his merit endureth for ever. 
 4  Unto the upright He shineth as a light in the darkness, gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous. 
 5  Well is it with the man that dealeth graciously and lendeth, that ordereth his affairs rightfully. 
 6 ¶ For he shall never be moved; the righteous shall be had in everlasting remembrance. 
 7  He shall not be afraid of evil tidings; his heart is stedfast, trusting in the LORD. 
 8  His heart is established, he shall not be afraid, until he gaze upon his adversaries. 
 9  He hath scattered abroad, he hath given to the needy; his righteousness endureth for ever; his horn shall be exalted in honour. 
 10  The wicked shall see it, and be vexed; he shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away; the desire of the wicked shall perish.
