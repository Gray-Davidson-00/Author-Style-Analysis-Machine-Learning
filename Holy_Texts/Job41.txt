 1 ¶ (40:25) Canst thou draw out leviathan with a fish-hook? or press down his tongue with a cord? 
 2  (40:26) Canst thou put a ring into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a hook? 
 3  (40:27) Will he make many supplications unto thee? or will he speak soft words unto thee? 
 4  (40:28) Will he make a covenant with thee, that thou shouldest take him for a servant for ever? 
 5  (40:29) Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? Or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens? 
 6  (40:30) Will the bands of fishermen make a banquet of him? Will they part him among the merchants? 
 7  (40:31) Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish-spears? 
 8  (40:32) Lay thy hand upon him; think upon the battle, thou wilt do so no more. 
 9  (41:1) Behold, the hope of him is in vain; shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him? 
 10  (41:2) None is so fierce that dare stir him up; who then is able to stand before Me? 
 11 ¶ (41:3) Who hath given Me anything beforehand, that I should repay him? Whatsoever is under the whole heaven is Mine. 
 12  (41:4) Would I keep silence concerning his boastings, or his proud talk, or his fair array of words? 
 13  (41:5) Who can uncover the face of his garment? Who shall come within his double bridle? 
 14  (41:6) Who can open the doors of his face? Round about his teeth is terror. 
 15  (41:7) His scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close seal. 
 16  (41:8) One is so near to another, that no air can come between them. 
 17  (41:9) They are joined one to another; they stick together, that they cannot be sundered. 
 18  (41:10) His sneezings flash forth light, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning. 
 19  (41:11) Out of his mouth go burning torches, and sparks of fire leap forth. 
 20  (41:12) Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a seething pot and burning rushes. 
 21  (41:13) His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth. 
 22  (41:14) In his neck abideth strength, and dismay danceth before him. 
 23  (41:15) The flakes of his flesh are joined together; they are firm upon him; they cannot be moved. 
 24  (41:16) His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, firm as the nether millstone. 
 25  (41:17) When he raiseth himself up, the mighty are afraid; by reason of despair they are beside themselves. 
 26  (41:18) If one lay at him with the sword, it will not hold; nor the spear, the dart, nor the pointed shaft. 
 27  (41:19) He esteemeth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood. 
 28  (41:20) The arrow cannot make him flee; slingstones are turned with him into stubble. 
 29  (41:21) Clubs are accounted as stubble; he laugheth at the rattling of the javelin. 
 30  (41:22) Sharpest potsherds are under him; he spreadeth a threshing-sledge upon the mire. 
 31  (41:23) He maketh the deep to boil like a pot; he maketh the sea like a seething mixture. 
 32  (41:24) He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep to be hoary. 
 33  (41:25) Upon earth there is not his like, who is made to be fearless. 
 34  (41:26) He looketh at all high things; he is king over all the proud beasts.
