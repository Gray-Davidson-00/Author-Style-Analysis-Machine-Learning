 1 ¶ A Song of Ascents. When the LORD brought back those that returned to Zion, we were like unto them that dream. 
 2  Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing; then said they among the nations: 'The LORD hath done great things with these.' 
 3  The LORD hath done great things with us; we are rejoiced. 
 4 ¶ Turn our captivity, O LORD, as the streams in the dry land. 
 5  They that sow in tears shall reap in joy. 
 6  Though he goeth on his way weeping that beareth the measure of seed, he shall come home with joy, bearing his sheaves.
